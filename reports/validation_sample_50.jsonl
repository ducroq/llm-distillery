{"id": "science_biorxiv_54c20153aca4", "title": "Lattice Instability Drives Formation of Protofilament Clusters at the Microtubule Plus End Tips", "content": "Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic cytoskeletal filaments composed of - and {beta}-tubulin protein dimers. They are crucial for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring proper chromosome segregation among other things. These biological functions are influenced by the dynamic instability of the MT plus-end tip. Recent work has challenged traditional models in which GTP (guanosine-5'-triphosphate) hydrolysis directly regulates microtubule lattice stability. To explore these notions further, in this work, we have constructed, from bottom up, a relatively high resolution coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) model for tubulins with 20 CG sites per tubulin monomer and then performed extensive CG MD simulations on MT lattices with 8 and 40 layers of heterodimers. Our findings demonstrate that, independent of nucleotide state, MT plus-end tips can form distinct, similarly curved protofilament (PF) clusters. These clusters are stable up to tens of microseconds of CG MD simulation time during spontaneous outward bending relaxation, and their formation is driven by an intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the MT lattice. Such lattice instability accumulates in longer microtubules and further facilitates protofilament cluster formation with outward bending relaxation; however, in longer MTs the lattice instability can also be released via lattice curvature and in-lattice twisting. Our systematic parametrization of the CG forcefield from atomic scale interactions also confirms weakened lateral interactions in GDP-MTs, which lead to faster bending relaxation and the formation of more PF clusters in both 8-layer and 40-layer GDP-bound MT lattices. A comprehensive all-atom MD analysis reveals that the formation of PF clusters is initiated by relaxation in the longitudinal interactions and later stabilized by relaxation in the lateral interactions. Our findings highlight the critical role of lattice instability in microtubule dynamics and offer new insight on the behavior of MT plus-end tips.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.16.682920v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-16T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-17T06:40:19.252858", "language": "en", "tags": ["life-sciences", "preprints", "biology", "cutting-edge", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 288, "author": "Xue, W., Wu, J., Bidone, T., Voth, G.

{"id": "science_arxiv_math_accfa2d0115b", "title": "TWIN: Two window inspection for online change point detection", "content": "arXiv:2510.11348v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We propose a new class of sequential change point tests, both for changes in the mean parameter and in the overall distribution function. The methodology builds on a two-window inspection scheme (TWIN), which aggregates data into symmetric samples and applies strong weighting to enhance statistical performance. The detector yields logarithmic rather than polynomial detection delays, representing a substantial reduction compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Delays remain short, even for late changes, where existing methods perform worst. Moreover, the new procedure also attains higher power than current methods across broad classes of local alternatives. For mean changes, we further introduce a self-normalized version of the detector that automatically cancels out temporal dependence, eliminating the need to estimate nuisance parameters. The advantages of our approach are supported by asymptotic theory, simulations and an application to monitoring COVID19 data. Here, structural breaks associated with new virus variants are detected almost immediately by our new procedures. This indicates potential value for the real-time monitoring of future epidemics. Mathematically, our approach is underpinned by new exponential moment bounds for the global modulus of continuity of the partial sum process, which may be of independent interest beyond change point testing.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11348", "published_date": "2025-10-14T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T06:40:22.302204", "language": "en", "tags": ["mathst", "preprints", "statth", "research", "mathematics", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 198, "author": "Patrick Bastian, Tim Kutta", "raw_content_length": 1433, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 0.99, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1430, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["TWIN", "Two window inspection", "online change point detection", "arXiv251011348v1 Announce Type", "new Abstract", "a new class", "sequential change point tests", "changes", "the mean parameter", "the overall distribution function"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"TWIN": 3.0, "Two window inspection": 2.0, "online change point detection": 2.0, "arXiv251011348v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "a new class": 1.0, "sequential change point tests": 1.0, "changes": 1.0, "the mean parameter": 1.0, "the overall distribution function": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.786374540277778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 7.553000000000001, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.5106, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8935, "joy": 0.0178, "surprise": 0.0219, "sadness": 0.0045, "fear": 0.0285, "anger": 0.0216, "disgust": 0.0122}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 1, "reasoning": "This is a theoretical methodology presented in an arXiv paper.

However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic.

After cleaning then trimming the large dataset to about 13.4% of its original size, we performed thorough data visualization and analysis of the dataset to identify important patterns. Next, in a set of five experiments exploring feature pruning, the tree-based models, namely Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost, generated mean square errors below 1.5 and R2 numbers above 0.998, outperforming the other ML models.

Second, an incentive-penalty mechanism enables effective interaction between the system and the green certificate–carbon joint trading market. Penalties are imposed for failing to meet renewable energy consumption targets or exceeding carbon quotas, while rewards are granted for meeting or exceeding targets. This regulates the system’s renewable energy consumption level and carbon emissions, ensuring robust low-carbon performance.

This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art.

The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation. From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a modulation. In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_8ee0add65a89", "title": "No Language Data Left Behind: A Comparative Study of CJK Language Datasets in the Hugging Face Ecosystem", "content": "arXiv:2507.04329v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs). However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity, and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen resource development across all three languages.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04329", "published_date": "2025-10-16T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T06:40:33.890871", "language": "en", "tags": ["computer-science", "preprints", "cscl", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 199, "author": "Dasol Choi, Woomyoung Park, Youngsook Song", "raw_content_length": 1532, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.995, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["the Hugging Face Ecosystem arXiv:2507.04329v3 Announce Type", "HuggingFace", "Natural Language Processing", "NLP", "CJK"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": ["over 1.6 billion"]}, "char_count": 1531, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["No Language Data", "CJK Language Datasets", "the Hugging Face Ecosystem", "arXiv250704329v3 Announce Type", "Abstract", "Recent advances", "Natural Language Processing", "NLP", "the crucial role", "high-quality datasets"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Natural Language Processing"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"No Language Data": 2.0, "CJK Language Datasets": 2.0, "the Hugging Face Ecosystem": 2.0, "arXiv250704329v3 Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Recent advances": 1.0, "Natural Language Processing": 1.0, "NLP": 1.0, "the crucial role": 1.0, "high-quality datasets": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7768050505555553, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.383500000000001, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.4767, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8779, "joy": 0.0104, "surprise": 0.0408, "sadness": 0.0192, "fear": 0.0183, "anger": 0.0198, "disgust": 0.0135}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 1, "reasoning": "This paper analyzes datasets, not deployed technology.

{"id": "community_social_reddit_chatgpt_c7c8aae48162", "title": "The Real Reason why ChatGPT isn't using Reddit anymore as a source", "content": "Pasting the NYT story below for those hitting a paywall. Actual lawsuit filing on the Reddit homepage here. Reddit Accuses 'Data Scraper' Companies of Theft In a lawsuit, Reddit pulled back the curtain on an ecosystem of start-ups that scrape Google’s search results and resell the information to data-hungry A.I. companies. Reddit, which went public last year, has banned scraping of its website and charges companies for access to its data. Credit: Natalie Keyssar for The New York Times Eight years ago, SerpApi, a start-up in Austin, Texas, dived headlong into the byzantine world of using robots to “scrape” Google’s search algorithms, so it could collect information to help customers appear higher in search results. Then OpenAI’s ChatGPT came along, kicking off an artificial intelligence revolution. As more tech companies began building A.I. chatbots to keep up, they needed large amounts of data to train their A.I. models — data that SerpApi had already gathered. Practically overnight, a class of companies like SerpApi — known as “data scrapers” — found a new business selling data scraped from Google to companies looking to train their A.I. chatbots. On Wednesday, the internet message board Reddit decided to fight the data scrapers. It filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that four companies had illegally stolen its data by scraping Google search results in which Reddit content appeared. Three of those companies — SerpApi; a Lithuanian start-up, Oxylabs; and a Russian company, AWMProxy — sold data to A.I. companies like OpenAI and Meta, according to the lawsuit. The fourth company, Perplexity, is a San Francisco start-up that makes an A.I. search engine. Reddit said it was seeking a permanent injunction against the companies, as well as financial damages, and wanted to prohibit the use or sale of any previously scraped Reddit data. “A.I. companies are locked in an arms race for quality human content — and that pressure has fueled an industrial-scale ‘data laundering’ economy,” said Ben Lee, the chief legal officer at Reddit. “Scrapers bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material.” In a statement, a SerpApi spokesman said the company had not received any communication from Reddit, disagreed with the allegations and would “vigorously defend ourselves in court.” Perplexity also said that it had not received the lawsuit but that its “approach remains principled and responsible as we provide factual answers with accurate A.I., and we will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.” Denas Grybauskas, who leads governance and strategy at Oxylabs, said the company had not yet been served but that “no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them.” A representative for AWMProxy did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Aravind Srinivas, the chief executive of Perplexity, in San Francisco in June. Credit: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Scraping the internet has been a longtime — albeit thorny — practice. In the internet’s earlier days, Google created an empire by using robots to scrape web pages and categorizing them, then offering a search engine that combed through those categories to help people find the information they needed. Along the way, companies began scraping Google and sold their findings to businesses seeking to appear higher in Google search results. The relationship between the scrapers and the scraped was seen as symbiotic. Google’s scraping could help direct web traffic to publishers’ sites. Those that scraped Google could sell that information to help web publishers build their sites in ways that made them easier for Google to surface. “It was all the original ecosystem of the web,” said Doug Leeds, a co-founder of Really Simple Licensing, a nonprofit that works to help publishers and creators obtain compensation when A.I. uses their work. “It wasn’t necessarily a problem back then, because there was a monetization method for all the companies involved.” Now, some feel the relationship has turned from symbiotic to parasitic. A.I. companies have used their own bots to hoover up as much information as possible without paying for the data. In response, companies like Reddit began locking down their websites to prevent A.I. companies from freely profiting off the data. Book publishers like Simon & Schuster and news organizations like The New York Times — which has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement — have struck deals to sell licenses to their data for millions of dollars. Reddit, which is used by more than 416 million people a week, said it believed it had particularly valuable data. Its users chat about a wide variety of topics, from makeup brands and Swiss dog breeds to role-playing video games and international travel tips. Such discussions can aid A.I. companies that are aiming to improve the “natural language” abilities of their chatbots. In 2023, Reddit asked outsiders to begin paying for access to its data. It forged licensing deals with Google, which uses Reddit data to train its Gemini chatbot, and OpenAI, which needs data to train ChatGPT. But not all companies wanted to sign deals. Instead, some found a way to use Reddit’s information through data scrapers, according to the lawsuit. SerpApi, Oxylabs and AWMProxy began scraping billions of Google search queries a month and used those searches to surface Reddit data, Reddit’s lawsuit said. The companies then packaged that data and resold it to others, which used it to train their A.I. systems. Perplexity was one of those buyers, according to Reddit’s lawsuit. Perplexity had scraped Reddit data in the past without payment but agreed to stop after Reddit sent it a cease-and-desist order. Even so, citations to Reddit data in Perplexity search results jumped “fortyfold,” the lawsuit said. Reddit has spent tens of millions of dollars on anti-scraping systems over several years. “Perplexity’s business model is effectively to take Reddit’s content from Google search results,” then feed it into an A.I. model and “call it a new product,” the lawsuit said. Reddit said it had set a trap for Perplexity by creating a “test post” on its site that could “only be crawled by Google’s search engine and was not otherwise accessible anywhere on the internet.” Within hours, Perplexity search results had surfaced the content of that test post, the lawsuit said. Google, which is not a plaintiff in Reddit’s lawsuit, has tried and failed to stop SerpApi and other data scrapers, according to the lawsuit and previous reporting from The Information. “Google has always actively respected the choices websites make through robots.txt, but sadly there’s a bunch of stealthy scrapers that do not,” José Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said in a statement. He was referring to how web publishers can opt out of being scraped by bots using robots.txt, an industry standard. Reddit may be fighting an uphill battle. While its lawsuit was filed in New York, some of the data-scraping start-ups like those targeted in the suit are based in Europe and Asia. And many of those companies have found workarounds against scraping bans. Still, Reddit plans to persist. In June, it sued Anthropic, accusing the A.I. company of unlawfully using its data. On Wednesday, the social network said in its lawsuit that it would continue taking steps to protect its data from unauthorized use. submitted by /u/meandererai [link] [comments]", "source":

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_25faf43e43b2", "title": "LAWCAT: Efficient Distillation from Quadratic to Linear Attention with Convolution across Tokens for Long Context Modeling", "content": "arXiv:2509.18467v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT (Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\\% passkey retrieval accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance on S-NIAH 1\\&2\\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark (QA2\\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\\% pre-training tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive long-sequence training data and computational resources.

Given that recent advances in nutritional interventions have been recognized as potential strategies for targeting cancer, we investigated the role of dietary serine restriction in OSCC cell plasticity. Utilizing multiple human OSCC-derived cell lines and an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of OSCC, we interrogated the impact of serine deprivation on this malignancy through biochemical assays, transcriptomic analyses, and CUT&RUN sequencing, as well as impact on tumor growth and its immune environment. We report that human OSCC cells behaved like serine auxotrophs, depending on exogenous serine for growth and maintenance of plastic cell states. We show that dietary restriction of serine induced endogenous serine synthesis and generated alpha-ketoglutarate (KG), a co-substrate for JMJD3 nuclear dioxygenase, which demethylates H3K27me3 and de-represses differentiation genes. This was accompanied by the reduction of H3K4me3 at stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes caused. Likewise, dietary serine restriction inhibited orthotopic OSCC isograft growth in mice concomitant with downregulation of H3K27me3 and increased immune infiltration in the tumor periphery. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the epigenetic etiology of OSCC that reveals the interplay between serine metabolism and epigenetic molecular mechanisms driving OSCC cell plasticity and tumorigenesis. The dependence of OSCC cells on exogenous serine to maintain plastic cell states offers a unique opportunity to utilize a non-toxic dietary serine restriction as an intervention treatment either alone or in combination with other therapies for OSCC patients.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.21.683420v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-22T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-23T01:54:12.370234", "language": "en", "tags": ["cutting-edge", "life-sciences", "biology", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 250, "author": "Jankowski, S.

However, their inherent vulnerabilities, combined with widespread adoption, create opportunities for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or compromise sensitive data stored on connected devices. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for Wi-Fi environments. Building on our previous work, we convert network traffic into two-dimensional data representations and use them to train DL models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We implement five distinct techniques for generating the two-dimensional representations, and to ensure low detection latency, we adopt lightweight CNN architectures in our NIDS. The models are trained using the AWID3 dataset, a publicly available benchmark for Wi-Fi NIDS research, and are evaluated for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive detection performance with low inference time, making it suitable for real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11898", "published_date": "2025-10-15T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-15T06:39:20.240939", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "computer-science", "cscr", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 174, "author": "Rayed Suhail Ahmad, Rehan Ahmad, Quamar Niyaz", "raw_content_length": 1287, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.87, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["CNN", "IoT"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1286, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Lightweight CNN", "arXiv251011898v1 Announce Type", "new Abstract", "Wi-Fi networks", "both home and enterprise environments", "a primary medium", "Internet access", "the backbone", "modern IoT ecosystems", "their inherent vulnerabilities"], "filter_categories": {"engineering": ["modern IoT ecosystems"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Lightweight CNN": 2.0, "arXiv251011898v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "Wi-Fi networks": 1.0, "both home and enterprise environments": 1.0, "a primary medium": 1.0, "Internet access": 1.0, "the backbone": 1.0, "modern IoT ecosystems": 1.0, "their inherent vulnerabilities": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7376563127777778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.8915, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.7783, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8632, "joy": 0.0096, "surprise": 0.0338, "sadness": 0.0085, "fear": 0.0519, "anger": 0.025, "disgust": 0.0081}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 5, "reasoning": "The abstract mentions 'real-world Wi-Fi deployment scenarios,' suggesting early commercial deployment, but lacks specifics on the scale or duration of these deployments.

{"id": "science_ieee_spectrum_online_40faf1fffd1f", "title": "4 Weird Things You Can Turn into a Supercapacitor", "content": "What do water bottles, eggs, hemp, and cement have in common? They can be engineered into strange, but functional, energy storage devices called supercapacitors.Like their name suggests, supercapacitors are like capacitors with greater capacity. Similar to a battery, they can store a lot of energy, but they can also charge or discharge quickly, similar to a capacitor. They’re usually found where a lot of power is needed quickly and for a limited time, like as a nearly-instantaneous backup electricity for a factory or data center.Typically, supercapacitors are made up of two activated carbon or graphene electrodes, electrolytes to introduce ions to the system, and a porous sheet of polymer or glass fiber to physically separate the electrodes. When a supercapacitor is fully charged, all of the positive ions gather on one side of the separating sheet, while all of the negative ions are on the other. When it’s discharged, the ions are randomly distributed, and it can switch between these states much faster than batteries can.Some scientists believe that supercapacitors could become more super. They think there’s potential to make these devices more sustainably, at lower-cost, and maybe even better performing if they’re built from better materials.And maybe they’re right. Last month, a group from Michigan Technological University reported making supercapacitors from plastic water bottles that had a higher capacitance than commercial ones.Does this finding mean recycled plastic supercapacitors will soon be everywhere? The history of similar supercapacitor sustainability experiments suggests not.About fifteen years ago, it seemed like supercapacitors were going to be in high demand—then, because of huge investments in lithium-ion technology, batteries became tough competition, explains Yury Gogotsi, who studies materials for energy storage devices at Drexel University. “They became so much cheaper and so much faster in delivering energy that for supercapacitors, the range of application became more limited,” he says. “Basically, the trend went from making them cheaper and available to making them perform where lithium-ion batteries cannot.”Still, some researchers remain hopeful that environmentally-friendly devices have a place in the market. Yun Hang Hu, a materials scientist on the Michigan Technological University team, sees “a promising path to commercialization [for the water bottle-derived supercapacitor] once collection and processing challenges are addressed,” he says.Here’s how scientists make supercapacitors with strange, unexpected materials:Water BottlesIt turns out your old Poland Spring bottle could one day store energy instead of water. Last month in the journal Energy & Fuels, the Michigan Technological University team published a new method for converting polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the material that makes up single-use plastic water bottles, into both electrodes and separators.As odd as it may seem, this process is “a practical blueprint for circular energy storage that can ride the existing PET supply chain,” says Hu.To make the electrodes, the researchers first shredded bottles into two millimeter grains and then added powdered calcium hydroxide. They heated the mixture to 700 °C in a vacuum for three hours and were left with an electrically conductive carbon powder. After removing residual calcium and activating the carbon (increasing its surface area), the powder could be shaped into a thin layer and used as an electrode.The process to produce the separators was much less intensive—the team cut bottles into squares about the size of a U.S. quarter and used hot needles to poke holes in them. They optimized the pattern of the holes for the passage of current using specialized software. PET is a good material for a separator because of its “excellent mechanical strength, high thermal stability, and excellent insulation,” Hu says.Filled with an electrolyte solution, the resulting supercapacitor not only demonstrated potential for eco- and finance-friendly material usage, but also slightly outperformed traditional materials on one metric. The PET device had a capacitance of 197.2 Farads per gram, while an analogous device with a glass fiber separator had a capacitance of 190.3 Farads per gram.EggsWait, don’t make your breakfast sandwich just yet! You could engineer a supercapacitor from one of your ingredients instead. In 2019, a University of Virginia team showed that electrodes, electrolytes, and separators could all be made from parts of a single object—an egg.First, the group purchased grocery store chicken eggs and sorted their parts into eggshells, eggshell membranes, and the whites and yolks.They ground the shells into a powder and mixed them with the egg whites and yolks. The slurry was freeze dried and brought up to 950 °C for an hour to decompose. After a cleaning process to remove calcium, the team performed heat and potassium treatments to activate the remaining carbon. They then smoothed the egg-derived activated carbon into a film to be used as electrodes. Finally, by mixing egg whites and yolks with potassium hydroxide and letting it dry for several hours, they formed a kind of gel electrolyte.To make separators, the group simply cleaned the eggshell membranes. Because the membranes naturally have interlaced micrometer-sized fibers, their inherent structures allow for ions to move across them just as manufactured separators would.Interestingly, the resulting fully-egg-based supercapacitor was flexible, with its capacitance staying steady even when the device was twisted or bent. After 5,000 cycles, the supercapacitor retained 80 percent of its original capacitance—low compared to commercial supercapacitors, but fairly on par for others made from natural materials.HempSome people may like cannabis for more medicinal purposes, but it has potential in energy storage, too. In 2024, a group from Ondokuz Mayıs University in Türkiye used pomegranate hemp plants to produce activated carbon for an electrode.They started by drying stems of the hemp plants in a 110 °C oven for a day, and then ground the stems into a powder. Next, they added sulfuric acid and heat to create a biochar, and, finally, activated the char by saturating it with potassium hydroxide and heating it again.After 2,000 cycles, the supercapacitor with hemp-derived electrodes still retained 98 percent of its original capacitance, which is, astoundingly, in range of those made from non-biological materials. The carbon itself had an energy density of 65 watt-hours per kilogram, also in line with commercial supercapacitors.CementIt may have a hold over the construction industry, but is cement coming for the energy sector, too? In 2023, a group from MIT shared how they designed electrodes from water, nearly pure carbon, and cement. Using these materials, they say, creates a “synergy” between the hydrophilic cement and hydrophobic carbon that aids the electrodes’ ability to hold layers of ions when the supercapacitor is charged.To test the hypothesis, the team built eight electrodes using slightly different proportions of the three ingredients, different types of carbon, and different electrode thicknesses. The electrodes were saturated with potassium chloride—an electrolyte—and capacitance measurements began.Impressively, the cement supercapacitors were able to maintain capacitance with little loss even after 10,000 cycles. The researchers also calculated that one of their supercapacitors could store around 10 kilowatt hours—enough to serve about one third of an average American’s daily energy use—though the number is only theoretical.", "source": "science_ieee_spectrum_online", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/supercapacitor-materials", "published_date": "2025-10-22T16:00:03",

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_adb321291ab6", "title": "A Semantic Framework for Patient Digital Twins in Chronic Care", "content": "arXiv:2510.09134v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model. Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients. Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems, transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and equitable management.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09134", "published_date": "2025-10-13T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T06:41:04.685918", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "csse", "preprints", "computer-science", "cset", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 203, "author": "Amal Elgammal, Bernd J.

{"id": "science_biorxiv_e47d4157c4ec", "title": "Stimulation of cholesterol efflux inhibits herpesvirus nuclear egress", "content": "Cholesterol in herpesvirus envelopes and host membranes supports membrane fusion during virus entry. However, relatively little is known about how cholesterol affects other aspects of the viral replication cycle. Here, using an infection model focused on reactivation from latency, we demonstrate that depleting intracellular cholesterol inhibits the production of infectious Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) virions. Treatment of latently infected cells with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22OH) increased expression of sterol response genes, including the cholesterol efflux pump ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), and triggered lytic reactivation and sharp reductions in the levels of intracellular cholesterol. Using a proteomics approach, by late stages of replication, we observed diminished viral protein accumulation and significant alterations in host protein expression, including proteins regulating the cell cycle and innate immune responses. Cholesterol poor conditions led to the accumulation of defective capsids in the nucleus and a reduction in viral particles accessing the cytoplasm. This effect on viral egress suggested functional defects in the conserved herpesvirus nuclear egress complex (NEC), comprised of two viral proteins that accumulate at the inner nuclear membrane and facilitate primary envelopment. We investigated the effects of 22OH on herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication and NEC protein trafficking. We found that 22OH inhibited HSV1 and HSV2 replication and spread in plaque reduction assays and impaired recruitment of NEC proteins UL31 and UL34 to the nuclear periphery. Taken together, these findings indicate that cholesterol efflux inhibits herpesvirus replication by interfering with nuclear egress.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.03.680238v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-03T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-04T01:45:26.406475", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "biology", "life-sciences", "cutting-edge", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 247, "author": "Pringle, E.

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_2d1ce9e3e562", "title": "Replacing Crontab with Systemd Timer: Benefits, Examples, and Migration Guide", "content": "Introduction For decades, cron has been the go-to solution for scheduling tasks in Linux systems. However, systemd timers offer a modern, more integrated alternative with several advantages. In this guide, we'll explore how to migrate from crontab to systemd timers, including the benefits, drawbacks, and practical examples. What are Systemd Timers? Systemd timers are unit files that control when systemd services should be executed. Unlike cron, which is a standalone daemon, systemd timers are fully integrated into the systemd ecosystem, providing better logging, dependency management, and system integration. Advantages of Systemd Timers 1. Better Logging and Monitoring All timer activities are logged through journald Easy to view logs with journalctl -u service-name Integrated with systemd's status reporting 2. Dependency Management Can specify dependencies on other services or system states Start services only when certain conditions are met Better control over execution order 3. Flexible Scheduling Calendar-based scheduling (similar to cron) Monotonic timers (relative to boot time, startup, etc.) Can trigger services on system events 4. Resource Control Integration with cgroups for resource limiting CPU and memory limits can be set per service Better process isolation 5. Failure Handling Automatic restart policies Notification on failure Better error tracking Disadvantages of Systemd Timers 1. Complexity Requires two files (.service and .timer) instead of one line Steeper learning curve compared to cron More verbose configuration 2. Portability Only works on systemd-based systems Cron is more universal across Unix-like systems 3. User-Level Timers User timers require --user flag and lingering enabled Slightly more complex setup for non-root users Basic Setup: Creating Your First Systemd Timer Step 1: Create the Service File First, create a service file that defines what should be executed. Save this as /etc/systemd/system/backup-script.service: [Unit] Description=Daily Backup Script Wants=network-online.target After=network-online.target [Service] Type=oneshot User=backup Group=backup ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/backup.sh StandardOutput=journal StandardError=journal # Resource limits CPUQuota=50% MemoryLimit=1G Step 2: Create the Timer File Next, create the corresponding timer file. Save this as /etc/systemd/system/backup-script.timer: [Unit] Description=Run backup script daily at 2 AM Requires=backup-script.service [Timer] OnCalendar=daily OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00 Persistent=true Unit=backup-script.service [Install] WantedBy=timers.target Step 3: Enable and Start the Timer # Reload systemd to recognize new files sudo systemctl daemon-reload # Enable the timer to start on boot sudo systemctl enable backup-script.timer # Start the timer immediately sudo systemctl start backup-script.timer # Check timer status sudo systemctl status backup-script.timer # List all active timers sudo systemctl list-timers --all Common Timer Configurations Every Hour [Timer] OnCalendar=hourly # Or more explicitly: OnCalendar=*-*-* *:00:00 Every 15 Minutes [Timer] OnCalendar=*:0/15 Weekdays at 9 AM [Timer] OnCalendar=Mon-Fri *-*-* 09:00:00 Every Monday at 3 AM [Timer] OnCalendar=Mon *-*-* 03:00:00 5 Minutes After Boot [Timer] OnBootSec=5min Combination: Daily and After Boot [Timer] OnCalendar=daily OnBootSec=10min Persistent=true Migration Example: From Crontab to Systemd Timer Original Crontab Entry 0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/cleanup.sh Equivalent Systemd Configuration cleanup.service: [Unit] Description=Cleanup temporary files [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cleanup.sh cleanup.timer: [Unit] Description=Daily cleanup at 2 AM [Timer] OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00 Persistent=true [Install] WantedBy=timers.target Understanding Key Timer Options OnCalendar Defines when the timer should trigger based on calendar time. Syntax is flexible: daily = *-*-* 00:00:00 weekly = Mon *-*-* 00:00:00 monthly = *-*-01 00:00:00 yearly = *-01-01 00:00:00 Persistent When set to true, if the system was off when the timer should have triggered, it will run immediately upon next boot. OnBootSec / OnStartupSec Triggers the timer relative to system boot or systemd startup. OnUnitActiveSec / OnUnitInactiveSec Triggers relative to when the service was last active or inactive. AccuracySec Defines the accuracy window for timer triggers (default: 1 minute). Can be adjusted for power saving: AccuracySec=1h Useful Management Commands # View all timers and their next trigger times systemctl list-timers # Check specific timer status systemctl status backup-script.timer # View service logs journalctl -u backup-script.service # View logs since last boot journalctl -u backup-script.service -b # Follow logs in real-time journalctl -u backup-script.service -f # Manually trigger a timer's service systemctl start backup-script.service # Stop a timer systemctl stop backup-script.timer # Disable a timer from starting on boot systemctl disable backup-script.timer # Check when timer will next trigger systemctl list-timers backup-script.timer User-Level Timers For non-root users, timers can be placed in ~/.config/systemd/user/ and managed with the --user flag: # Enable user timer systemctl --user enable my-script.timer # Start user timer systemctl --user start my-script.timer # List user timers systemctl --user list-timers # Enable lingering (allows user timers to run without login) sudo loginctl enable-linger username Advanced Example: Service with Email Notification backup-with-notification.service: [Unit] Description=Backup with notification OnFailure=failure-notification@%n.service [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/backup.sh ExecStartPost=/usr/local/bin/notify-success.sh Debugging Tips Check syntax: Use systemd-analyze calendar \"Mon *-*-* 09:00:00\" to verify OnCalendar expressions Dry run: Test your service manually before enabling the timer: sudo systemctl start backup-script.service Verbose logging: Add to service file: [Service] StandardOutput=journal StandardError=journal Check timer accuracy: systemctl show backup-script.timer -p NextElapseUSecRealtime Conclusion Systemd timers provide a powerful, modern alternative to cron with better integration, logging, and flexibility. While they require more initial setup, the benefits in maintainability, monitoring, and system integration make them worth considering for new deployments. For existing systems with working cron jobs, migration can be gradual. Start with new scheduled tasks using systemd timers, and migrate critical cron jobs over time as you become more comfortable with the syntax and tooling. Quick Decision Guide: Use Systemd Timers when: You need detailed logging and monitoring Dependencies on other services are required Resource limiting is important You're on a systemd-based distribution Stick with Cron when: Simplicity is paramount Portability across systems is required You have legacy scripts that work well System doesn't use systemd Have you migrated from cron to systemd timers?

{"id": "arxiv_bba1db0649d7", "title": "Dynamical friction shear and rotation in Chaplygin cosmology", "content": "In this study, we build upon the findings of Del Popolo et al. (2013) by further analyzing the influence of dynamical friction on the evolution of cosmological perturbations within the framework of the spherical collapse model (SCM) in a Universe dominated by generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). Specifically, we investigate how dynamical friction alters the growth rate of density perturbations, the effective sound speed, the equation-of-state parameter www, and the evolution of the cosmic expansion rate. Our results demonstrate that dynamical friction significantly delays the collapse process compared to the standard SCM. Accurate computation of these parameters is crucial for obtaining consistent results and reliable physical interpretations when employing the GCG model. Furthermore, our analysis confirms that the suppression of perturbation growth due to dynamical friction is considerably more pronounced than that caused by shear and rotation, as previously indicated by Del Popolo et al. (2013). This enhanced suppression effectively addresses the instability issues, such as oscillations or exponential divergences in the dark-matter power spectrum, highlighted in linear perturbation studies, such as those by Sandvik et al.

Inspired by political behavior theory, STL leverages shared demographic variables with high predictive power in a polarized American context to transfer knowledge across surveys. Using a neural network pre-trained on the Cooperative Election Study (CES) 2020, freezing early layers to preserve learned structure, and fine-tuning top layers on the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020, STL generates silicon responses CES 2022 and in held-out ANES 2020 data with accuracy rates of up to 93 percent. Results show that STL outperforms LLMs, especially on sensitive measures such as racial resentment. While LLMs silicon samples are costly and opaque, STL generates empirically grounded silicon responses with high individual-level accuracy, potentially helping to mitigate key challenges in social

{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_dea3aa1c3187", "title": "Bondskanselier Merz blijft erbij: CDU wil niet samenwerken met de AfD", "content": "De Duitse bondskanselier Merz blijft de tot rechts-extremistisch aangemerkte AfD uitsluiten als toekomstig coalitiepartner. Dat is de uitkomst van een overleg van de partijtop van CDU, de christendemocratische partij van Merz. Voorafgaand aan dit overleg had Merz samenwerking met de AfD ook al afgewezen. Na afloop deed hij dat nog veel stelliger. \"We hebben niets gemeen met deze partij, dat wil ik benadrukken\", zei Merz. \"Ze zeggen dat ze ons willen vernietigen. Dat is iets wat ik nog nooit van een andere partij heb gehoord. Iedereen die zoiets zegt, moet weten dat hij op de meest vastberaden weerstand zal stuiten. We zullen niet toestaan dat deze mensen ons vernietigen.\" Het overleg volgde op een oproep van drie voormalige kopstukken van de CDU en de zusterpartij CSU uit Beieren. De AfD is door de Duitse binnenlandse veiligheidsdienst in mei als rechts-extremistisch bestempeld, en daarmee een gevaar voor de democratie. Verschillen duidelijker maken Toch zeiden de drie voormalige partijbonzen dat CDU/CSU samenwerking met de AfD niet zonder meer moest afwijzen, omdat die partij ondanks de afwijzingen door andere partijen almaar groter wordt en er zonder de AfD mogelijk geen regering kan worden gevormd. Komend jaar zijn er vijf deelstaatverkiezingen en in Saksen-Anhalt en Mecklenburg-Vorpommern lijkt AfD ruim te gaan winnen. Merz zei vandaag dat de CDU de AfD met alle politieke middelen zal bestrijden. De verschillen tussen beide partijen gaan niet over details, maar over fundamentele vraagstukken en fundamentele politieke overtuigingen, zei hij. De CDU wil die verschillen de komende tijd veel duidelijker over het voetlicht brengen. Correspondent Chiem Balduk: \"De voorzichtige geluiden in de partij die samenwerking met de AfD opperden, zijn tot zwijgen gebracht. We zagen een felle Merz, die met stellige woorden afstand nam van die partiij. Coalities aangaan met de rechts-extremistische partij is dus uitgesloten zolang Merz de christendemocraten leidt. Toch weigerde de bondskanselier in te gaan op het realistische scenario dat de AfD volgend jaar in twee Oost-Duitse deelstaten te groot om te negeren wordt. Het alternatief, regeren met álle andere (uitsluitend linkse) partijen, is evenmin populair. De oproep tot samenwerking met de AfD zal dan ongetwijfeld weer luider worden. Merz gaf met deze toespraak ook een boodschap af aan zijn coalitie met de sociaaldemocratische SPD. Die wordt geplaagd door voortdurende vetes en spanningen. De regering moet gaan leveren, zegt Merz, 'zodat er geen behoefte meer is aan een alternatief voor Duitsland'.\"", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url":

Accurate forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$), especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory, significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs",

{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_8d226c90c50e", "title": "Kaziranga Director Took on Floods, Poachers & the Wild ‚Äî Becoming India‚Äôs 1st Woman To Win a Major Global Conservation Award", "content": "The forests of Kaziranga have long been a testing ground for courage — of guards who wade through waist-deep floods to protect the rhinos, elephants that carry them across swelling rivers, and leaders who must hold it all together when the wild turns unpredictable. Among them is Dr Sonali Ghosh, the Park’s Field Director, whose steady hand and deep empathy have guided this fragile landscape through challenge after challenge. Her work has now earned her one of the world’s highest honours in conservation — the IUCN’s Kenton Miller Award. The recognition — a first for India — celebrates a form of leadership that is as much about compassion as control, as much about listening to people as protecting wildlife. A childhood shaped by wilderness Born in Pune in 1975 into a middle-class Bengali family, Dr Sonali grew up across India due to her father’s service in the Indian Army. The frequent relocations exposed her to forests, rivers, and landscapes that became the backdrop of her earliest memories. Dr Sonali Ghosh earns India's first-ever IUCN Kenton Miller Award for innovation and inclusion She had the opportunity to meet new people and absorb their culture. However, it was the time she spent outdoors, unstructured and abundant, that shaped her bond with the natural world. Though she calls herself a “late bloomer”, her fascination with nature deepened through her academic journey in life sciences. Her turning point came when she secured a seat at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, one of the country’s foremost institutions for ecological research and conservation. There, her hidden passion was changed into a lifelong purpose. The making of a forest officer When Dr Sonali joined the Indian Forest Service, she found herself returning to the very landscapes that had once trained her — Kaziranga, Manas, and Orang. What had begun as fieldwork was now her responsibility to protect. As a young officer, she came face-to-face with the harsh realities of conservation: poaching threats, monsoon floods, scarce resources, and the constant strain of managing fragile ecosystems under human pressure. Those early years shaped her deeply. She learnt what it truly meant to protect India’s forests — not from behind a desk, but from the back of an elephant, inside remote patrol camps, and alongside frontline staff who risk their lives every day. Shattering stereotypes in a green uniform On 1 September 2023, Dr Sonali made history as the first woman field director of Kaziranga National Park — a defining moment not just for her, but for India’s conservation movement. Kaziranga is no ordinary landscape. Spread across the floodplains of the Brahmaputra, it shelters the world’s largest population of the one-horned rhinoceros, along with elephants, tigers, swamp deer and over 500 species of birds. Managing such an ecosystem demands far more than administrative skill — it requires ecological insight, crisis management, and unrelenting resolve. Dr Sonali came face-to-face with the harsh realities of conservation when she joined the Indian Forest Service But even as Dr Sonali tackled poaching, encroachments, and floods, she faced another challenge — the quiet, persistent gender bias that shadows women in forestry. She has faced scepticism, casual dismissal, and the constant need to prove herself in a space long dominated by men. Early in her career, basic amenities such as clean drinking water and toilets were missing at field posts — challenges her male peers seldom had to think about. Yet, rather than deterring her, these experiences only strengthened her resolve to make the system better for those who came after her. Leading with heart and purpose Against the odds, Dr Sonali has transformed how Kaziranga is managed — not only through stronger protection but through empathy, science, and community partnership. Her leadership blends enforcement with inclusion, proving that conservation is most powerful when people and nature thrive together. Under her watch, the park has seen major strides: Stronger wildlife protection protocols, especially for rhinos and tigers Community-led conservation, helping local families build sustainable livelihoods that reduce dependence on forest resources Better welfare of frontline forest staff, who often work in isolation and high-risk conditions Responsible ecotourism initiatives that preserve Kaziranga’s fragile ecology while benefiting nearby villages Dr Sonali has transformed how Kaziranga is managed, not only through stronger protection but through empathy Her approach is rooted in coexistence, not control — rooted in the belief that conservation cannot be sustained unless it involves those who live closest to the forest. A milestone for India — and for every woman in green Named after the renowned conservationist, Dr Kenton R Miller, the Kenton Miller Award is conferred by the IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas. Past recipients have included distinguished figures from Brazil, South Africa, and Australia. In 2025, the honour came to India, for the first time, with Dr Sonali’s name inscribed upon it. She was chosen for her “innovative contributions” to protected area management, including scientific interventions in habitat conservation, community integration, and the creation of replicable, people-centric conservation models. In recognising her, the IUCN effectively acknowledged India’s rising leadership in conservation and the individuals who tirelessly serve on its frontlines.For Dr Sonali, the award is not a destination but a renewed responsibility. She continues to focus on long-term wildlife monitoring, flood preparedness, and mentoring the next generation of conservation leaders, especially young women entering the service. Even as her days are filled with data, policy meetings, and field deployments, she remains grounded in the same truth that began her journey — an enduring love for the forests that shaped her.", "source": "positive_news_the_better_india", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://thebetterindia.com/wildlife/sonali-ghosh-first-indian-iucn-kenton-miller-award-winner-kaziranga-field-director-wildlife-conservation-10557023", "published_date": "2025-10-13T09:54:18", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T12:52:55.292497", "language": "en", "tags": ["wildlife", "innovation", "sustainability", "india", "social_good", "trending", "explore_all_stories", "positive_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "The Better India : Latest Posts", "source_category": "positive_news", "word_count": 919, "author": "Raajwrita Dutta", "raw_content_length": 8494, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 4.595, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["IUCN", "Floods, Poachers & the Wild ‚Äî Becoming"], "persons": ["Sonali", "Took on", "Kenton Miller Award", "Sonali Ghosh"], "locations": ["India", "Pune", "Kaziranga"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 5953, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Kaziranga Director", "Floods", "Poachers", "the Wild Äî", "IndiaÄôs 1st Woman", "a Major Global Conservation Award", "who", "them", "challenge", "The forests"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Kaziranga Director": 2.0, "Floods": 2.0, "Poachers": 2.0, "the Wild Äî": 2.0, "IndiaÄôs 1st Woman": 2.0, "a Major Global Conservation Award": 2.0, "who": 2.0, "them": 2.0, "challenge": 2.0, "The forests": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 3.063884787777778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.741, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.9482, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.4691, "joy": 0.0929, "surprise": 0.0091, "sadness": 0.0074, "fear": 0.3861, "anger": 0.0257, "disgust": 0.0097}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 7, "reasoning": "Kaziranga National Park is a well-established and managed area, indicating long-term operational deployment of conservation strategies.

{"id": "spanish_xataka_c3edb8021f18", "title": "Microsoft ya no vende software: vende inevitabilidad", "content": "OpenAI ha dejado de ser una entidad con un control híbrido y pasa a ser una empresa con todas las de la ley. Es decir, con ánimo de lucro. Microsoft, que tenía derechos especiales y un puesto en su junta, cede esa posición a cambio de algo más estable: Acceso garantizado y perpetuo a los modelos de OpenAI (los actuales y los futuros).Libertad para crear sus propios modelos fundacionales sin restricciones.Gana independencia sin perder tecnología. Por qué es importante. Esto no convierte a Microsoft en dueña de OpenAI, sino en la plataforma que convierte su IA en producto masivo. OpenAI puede seguir investigando, pero quien controla el acceso a usuarios y empresas sigue siendo Microsoft. La distribución define hoy el poder, por encima incluso de la invención. La panorámica general. Microsoft lleva más de una década transformando su negocio desde la venta de licencias hacia la venta de dependencia continua: Office 365 eliminó o relegó la opción de comprar el software una sola vez.Windows 10 introdujo actualizaciones obligatorias que convirtieron el sistema operativo en servicio permanente.Azure ha atado la infraestructura empresarial a su nube.El patrón es consistente: convertir herramientas en plataformas, productos en suscripciones, y opciones en inevitabilidades. El acuerdo con OpenAI no es una excepción, es la culminación. En Xataka OpenAI ya es una apuesta binaria: o consigue la AGI, o todo revienta En detalle. Microsoft mantiene algo que ningún otro actor tiene: Integración directa de Copilot en Office, Teams, Outlook y Windows.Contratos empresariales a gran escala que convierten la IA en coste estructural del trabajo digital.Control sobre el punto de entrada: el lugar donde millones de personas trabajan cada día. El nuevo acuerdo asegura que OpenAI no puede cerrarle el grifo, y que Microsoft puede ampliar o sustituir sus modelos sin depender de terceros. El trasfondo estratégico. Hasta ahora, Microsoft no podía desarrollar su propia AGI. Ahora sí. Esto le permite dos rutas paralelas: Usar los modelos de OpenAI en su ecosistema.Desarrollar los suyos propios (o integrarlos con otros) si OpenAI se desvía o se retrasa. Gana libertad tecnológica y estabilidad comercial. Pero sobre todo, gana algo más valioso: la certeza de que la IA no será opcional en su software. Entre líneas. El movimiento consolida a Microsoft como el principal canal de consumo de IA en el trabajo. No por contrato, sino por posición de mercado. Millones de usuarios ya pagan por Copilot sin elegirlo expresamente. Las empresas lo asumen como parte del coste normal de productividad. No hay alternativa real: si trabajas en Word, usas Copilot. Si gestionas correos en Outlook, usas Copilot. Si coordinas equipos en Teams, usas Copilot. Sí, pero. Esto no es el dominio tecnológico tradicional. Microsoft no necesita tener la mejor IA. Solo necesita tener la más integrada. OpenAI puede ser más brillante, Google puede ser más rápido, Meta puede ser más abierta (o no tan abierta). No importa, porque ninguno está dentro del software donde se hace el trabajo. La IA deja de ser un añadido. Se convierte en infraestructura invisible. El contraste. Otros gigantes tecnológicos siguen apostando por la excelencia del modelo: Google ha invertido miles de millones en Gemini.Meta abrió Llama.Amazon empuja Bedrock.Anthropic ha ganado enteros en entornos empresariales.Todos compiten por tener la mejor tecnología, pero Microsoft compite por otra cosa: por ser el lugar donde esa tecnología se usa, independientemente de quién la haya creado. En resumen: OpenAI se libera para crecer como empresa.Microsoft se asegura de que, ocurra lo que ocurra, la IA pase por su software.El resto de la industria compite por inventar. Microsoft ha ganado distribuyendo.No vende IA. Vende inevitabilidad.
