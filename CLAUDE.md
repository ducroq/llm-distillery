# CLAUDE.md - LLM Distillery

- **Status**: Production
- **agent-ready-projects**: v1.7.0

## What Is This?

**LLM Distillery** is a knowledge distillation framework. It trains small, cheap, local classifiers (Gemma-3-1B + LoRA) to replicate expensive cloud LLM scoring (Gemini Flash) at 100x lower cost and 50x faster inference.

**Core workflow:** Oracle (Gemini Flash) scores articles on dimensions (0-10) → Train student model (Gemma-3-1B) → Deploy as filter package

**System context:** llm-distillery creates filters. NexusMind deploys them for production scoring. The interface is the filter package: `filters/{name}/v{N}/` directories copied between repos, plus HuggingFace Hub uploads.

## Tech Stack

- **Oracle**: Gemini Flash ($0.001/article, dimensional scoring)
- **Student**: Gemma-3-1B (`google/gemma-3-1b-pt`) with PEFT/LoRA adapters
- **Calibration**: Per-dimension isotonic regression (ADR-008)
- **Hybrid inference**: e5-small embedding probe (Stage 1) + fine-tuned model (Stage 2, ADR-006)
- **Training data**: 5K-10K oracle-scored articles per filter, 80/10/10 splits

## Hard Constraints

- **Oracle outputs scores only.** Dimensional scores (0-10), never tier/stage classifications. Tier assignment is postprocessing. Changing thresholds must never require re-labeling.
- **Use `load_base_model_for_seq_cls()`** from `filters/common/model_loading.py`. Never use `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` directly — Gemma-3-1B's `gemma3_text` config isn't in the Auto mapping.
- **Keep PEFT adapters in OLD key format.** `.lora_A.weight` / `score.weight`, not `.lora_A.default.weight`. Never run `resave_adapter.py` before Hub upload — it breaks `PeftModel.from_pretrained()`.
- **Fit `calibration.json` after every training run.** Isotonic regression on the val set. Commit with the filter package. The base scorer auto-loads it.

## Production Filters

| Filter | Version | MAE | Training Data | Status |
|--------|---------|-----|---------------|--------|
| **uplifting** | v7 | — | 5.3K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) — hybrid inference added |
| **sustainability_technology** | v3 | 0.72 | 10.6K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) |
| **investment-risk** | v6 | 0.47 | 10.4K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) |
| **cultural-discovery** | v4 | 0.74 | 8K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) |
| **belonging** | v1 | 0.49 | 7.4K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) |
| **nature_recovery** | v2 | 0.53 | 3.5K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) — v1 had no discrimination (#41), v2 uses sample weighting |
| **foresight** | v1 | 0.75 | 3.5K articles | Deployed (HF Hub, private) |

### In Development (priority: ovr.news tabs)

| Filter | Version | Status | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **thriving** | v1 | PARKED indefinitely — orthogonal lens design caused bimodal distribution (ADR-015); uplifting v7 stays as Thriving tab |  |
| **ai-engineering-practice** | v2 | Ready for oracle scoring; rename to augmented-engineering at next bump | Separate product (not ovr.news) |

## Key Decisions

- **Dimensional regression (0-10)** — not classifications (ADR-001)
- **Screen+merge for needle-in-haystack filters** (ADR-003)
- **Commerce is the only universal prefilter** (ADR-004)
- **Active learning for rare tiers** (ADR-005)
- **Fine-tuning beats embedding probes** — research confirmed
- **Gemma-3-1B** — replaced Qwen2.5; better MAE, faster inference
- **Add filters first, reduce later** — deploy as separate tabs, dedup later (ADR-009)
- **Lens-aligned filter naming** — rename filters to match ovr.news lens names at version bumps (ADR-012)
- **Oracle consistency over data volume** — prompt precision predicts MAE better than dataset size; use belonging v1 as template (ADR-010)
- **Embedding screening for needle filters** — use Phase 3 positives as e5-small seeds to screen corpora; replaces keyword screening (ADR-011)
- **English lens names** — all lens/tab names in English, no Dutch (ADR-013)
- **Cross-filter percentile normalization** — non-linear mapping from production CDF; supersedes score_scale_factor (ADR-014)
- **Lenses as perspectives, not partitions** — overlap between lenses is correct; never exclude adjacent lens content in oracle prompts (ADR-015)
- **Drop tier assignments** — filters output pass/block + continuous score only; tiers add no value over the score itself (ADR-016)

## Cross-Repo Evidence

This project is a source project for [agentic-engineering](https://github.com/ducroq/agentic-engineering) — a proposition about what's new when engineers work with AI agents. When you discover evidence relevant to the four patterns (verification findings, context architecture lessons, reproduce-don't-assess examples, LLM behavioral properties), file an issue at `ducroq/agentic-engineering` with the pattern name, quantified results, and which claims it supports.
