  block_patterns:
    no_outcomes:
      - Policy announced but no implementation data
      - "Plans to introduce policy" (future-only)
      - Net-zero pledges without interim targets or enforcement

    pure_advocacy:
      - "Should pass policy" (advocacy without examples)
      - Opinion pieces about what policy "ought to do"

  pass_patterns:
    has_outcomes:
      - "Emissions fell X% after policy"
      - "Renewable deployment grew Y% following policy"
      - Before/after data showing measurable change

    replicability:

    policy_outcomes:
      weight: 0.30
      description: "Did deployment/emissions measurably change after policy?"
      scale: |
        0-2: No outcomes data, policy not yet implemented
        3-4: Announced but no measurable impact yet
        5-6: Some positive outcomes, modest impact
        7-8: Clear measurable impact (emissions fell, deployment grew)
        9-10: Transformative impact with strong causal link to policy
      requirements:
        - "Before/after data (emissions, deployment, behavior)"
        - "Time series showing change"
        - "Attribution to policy (not just correlation)"
      examples:
        - "Norway EV sales 5% → 90% after tax policy → 10"
        - "Germany renewables 10% → 50% post-FIT → 9"

    replicability:
      weight: 0.25
      description: "Can other jurisdictions copy this blueprint?"
      scale: |
        0-2: Impossible to replicate (unique circumstances only)
        3-4: Very context-dependent, hard to transfer
        5-6: Some transferability, requires adaptation
        7-8: Highly replicable, proven in multiple contexts
        9-10: Global blueprint, dozens copying
      indicators:
        high_replicability:
          - "X countries adopting similar policy"
          - "Clear mechanism (feed-in tariff, carbon tax, mandate)"
          - "Works across different political systems"
        low_replicability:
          - "Only works due to unique geography/culture"
          - "Requires authoritarian control"
          - "No details on how to implement"

    political_durability:
      weight: 0.15
      description: "Will this survive government change? Institutionalized?"
      scale: |
        0-2: Executive order, easily reversed, partisan
        3-4: Single-party legislation, vulnerable
        5-6: Bipartisan support, some institutional backing
        7-8: Institutionalized, bipartisan, hard to reverse
        9-10: Constitutional, multi-decade track record
      examples:
        - "Norway EV policy: 30+ years, all parties support → 9"
        - "US Clean Power Plan: executive order, reversed → 2"

      weight: 0.10
      description: "How fast did policy deliver results?"
      scale: |
        0-2: >10 years, no results yet
        3-4: 5-10 years to see impact
        5-6: 3-5 years
        7-8: 1-3 years (rapid deployment response)
        9-10: <1 year (immediate behavior change)
      examples:
        - "Denmark wind auctions: deployment within 2 years → 8"
        - "Carbon tax: emissions fell within 1 year → 9"

    equity_impact:
      weight: 0.08
      description: "Who benefits? Who pays? Just transition?"
      scale: |
        0-2: Regressive, harms vulnerable populations
        3-4: Neutral, no equity considerations
        5-6: Some equity provisions (rebates, worker support)
        7-8: Equity-centered, benefits low-income disproportionately
        9-10: Reparative, addresses historical injustice
      indicators:
        - "Revenue recycling (carbon tax → rebates)"
        - "Just transition provisions (fossil worker retraining)"
        - "Low-income benefits (reduced energy burden)"

    enforcement_mechanisms:
      weight: 0.07
      description: "Are there teeth? Penalties? Monitoring?"
      scale: |
        0-2: Voluntary, no penalties, no monitoring
        3-4: Weak enforcement, rarely penalized
        5-6: Moderate enforcement, some accountability
        7-8: Strong enforcement, automatic penalties
        9-10: Market-based enforcement (price signal automatic)
      examples:
        - "EU ETS: automatic penalties for non-compliance → 8"
        - "Corporate pledges: voluntary, no enforcement → 1"

        3-4: Some significant downsides
        5-6: Minor trade-offs, manageable
        7-8: Minimal downsides, well-designed
        9-10: Net positive across all dimensions
      examples:
        - "Feed-in tariff: higher electricity prices (manageable) → 7"
        - "Diesel subsidy removal: protests, rollback → 3"

      description: "Are others adopting? Network effect?"
      scale: |
        0-2: No one copying, failed experiment
        3-4: Limited interest, no adoption yet
        5-6: 2-5 jurisdictions considering/adopting
        7-8: 5-15 jurisdictions adopted
        9-10: >15 jurisdictions, global standard emerging
      examples:
        - "Feed-in tariffs: adopted by 50+ countries → 10"
        - "Norway EV tax policy: 15+ countries copying → 9"
