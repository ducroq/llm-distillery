{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_a45aaa33f280", "title": "#NotAResolution: In 2026, I Plan to Cut My Non-Essential Shopping by 50% & Create Less Waste", "content": "The start of a new year often comes with big resolutions, many of which quietly fade by February. Through Better India Goals 2026, we’re doing things differently. This series brings together personal, practical goals set by our team — rooted in lived experiences, not perfection. These are intentions shaped by real lives, evolving challenges, and the hope that small, consistent changes can lead to a better year for ourselves and those around us. Why this goal exists I am getting ready when I notice a pile of clothes in front of me. It almost mocks me as I sigh for the tenth time, “I have nothing to wear.” It is a familiar feeling for many of us with overflowing wardrobes who still struggle to put together a decent outfit. Standing over that heap, overwhelmed by my own belongings, the discomfort of this first-world problem brought a moment of clarity: I needed to buy less and buy better. So, my Better India Goal for 2026 is to reduce all non-essential purchases by at least 50 percent, with a specific focus on clothing. This means choosing fewer, longer-lasting items and actively avoiding impulse shopping. The benefits are simple. I gain more mental space, and the already overburdened landfills of my city receive some relief. Slow shopping reduces impulse buys and promotes mindful, planet-friendly choices. Photograph: (Cottonbro studio/Pexels) Why this matters beyond me As a child, I once mistook Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill for a real mountain. Almost as tall as the Qutub Minar and complete with an ecosystem of its own, it’s a towering reminder of legacy waste, growing with every needless purchase. India generates around 1.7 lakh tonnes of municipal solid waste every single day. Only about 53 per cent of it is processed or recycled. Everything else is pushed into landfills, where it seeps into the soil, poisons water sources, and releases methane into the air we breathe. Much of this waste exists because we buy far more than we truly need. In India, most fast fashion ends up in landfills as only a small fraction of textile waste is recycled. Photograph: (Sourcing Journal) No single person can repair a city’s waste system. Yet everyday choices shape how much pressure those systems face. They also shape something far more personal. The weight of excess. The fatigue of managing too many things. The constant sense of clutter that follows us from cupboard to cupboard. Impulse buying rarely begins with need. It often begins with a feeling. A moment of stress. A scroll through comparison. The promise that one more purchase will make life feel lighter or happier. The satisfaction arrives briefly, then fades. What remains is guilt, financial strain, and one more item demanding space, care, and attention. Choosing to consume less creates room to breathe. It lightens the load we place on the planet and on ourselves. Fewer things to manage. Fewer decisions to make. More mental clarity. In that sense, reducing consumption supports sustainability and strengthens emotional well-being at the same time. Fast fashion is made cheaply to look trendy, not to last, encouraging frequent buying rather than thoughtful use. Photograph: (Munir Uz Zaman / AFP) How I plan to do this Like most resolutions, this one will only work if it is built into everyday behaviour through small, repeatable actions. I’m focusing on habits that reduce impulse and shift desire. Here are some ways: Removing triggers by deleting shopping apps and unsubscribing from ‘limited-time’ sales emails that ‘manufacture’ urgency. Letting purchases marinate by leaving items in my cart for at least 48 hours before paying, allowing impulse to pass. Most items will likely lose their appeal upon review. Re-training my social media algorithm by following creators who advocate slow living, outfit repetition, and conscious consumption. Choosing fewer, higher-quality pieces, even when cheaper alternatives look lucrative. Saving intentionally for one well-made item instead of accumulating multiple low-quality ones. Repeating outfits unapologetically and renting or borrowing elaborate outfits for special occasions whenever possible. How I will track this To analyse and keep a tab on these habits, I intend to follow these steps: I will track how many items I buy, not only how much money I spend. A monthly count helps me notice excess and recognise patterns over time. I will do a monthly “use check” to see what I actually wore or used. If something stayed untouched, I pause to ask why. That answer often tells me what not to buy again. I will try challenges such as no-buy months and pay attention to what triggers slip-ups, whether sales, stress, or social pressure. I will mark simple milestones, like completing 30 days without impulse buys or resisting festive sales periods. Blocking sale notifications helps curb impulse buying by reducing constant pressure to shop. Photograph: (Shutterstock) An invitation The world already asks a lot of us. Our homes do not need to add to that pressure. Getting dressed in the morning or cooking a meal should not feel like navigating chaos. They can feel smooth, familiar, even comforting, when we are not buried under things we barely use. There is something quietly satisfying about owning fewer things that actually do their job. Two pairs of socks you reach for without thinking. One cup you always pick first. Things that fit into your life instead of demanding your attention. As The Minimalists put it, buying less gives us more room to live. If this thought feels familiar or even a little relieving, maybe it is worth trying. I am giving it a year, and you are welcome to see where it takes you, too.

{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_cf7e9bdb68fb", "title": "This UP Coach Built a Free Training System That Supports 300+ Players From Tier-2 India", "content": "“My father taught me that if you set out to do something, you must do it with complete dedication, or not at all,” says Abhinav Sinha (35), his voice calm yet unflinching. “In sport, you cannot do things half-heartedly. If you choose the path, you walk it with absolute intent.” Prayagraj, his hometown, mirrors that belief in many ways. The city sits at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna, shaped by centuries of faith and routine. Ancient ghats (riverfront steps), narrow lanes, and the steady rhythm of life by the river framed Abhinav’s childhood. Born into a family of lawyers, discipline and expectation were part of daily life. The assumption was clear. Education, stability, and a respected profession would define his future. Sport, especially squash, did not feature in that plan. There were no squash academies in the city and no formal coaching pathways. Fast-forward to today, and Abhinav has trained over 300 athletes, supported multiple national champions, and built a pipeline of talent emerging from tier-2 towns across India. Through Chance2Sports Foundation, which he co-leads with Chetan Desai, and SportsSkill, a tech-enabled platform created to support the foundation’s athletes, Abhinav is widening access to a sport long seen as exclusive. Hunger, discipline, and consistency matter more here than privilege or postcode. When frustration turns into partnership The partnership between Abhinav and Chetan grew out of shared frustration with the Indian sports ecosystem. “Chetan and I came together because we were both experiencing the same problem from opposite ends,” Abhinav says. “I was coaching athletes and trying to track progress through Excel sheets, while international academies were recording and analysing every session in detail. I knew we were missing critical information.” Abhinav has trained over 300 athletes, supported multiple national champions, and built a pipeline of talent emerging from tier-2 towns across India. Abhinav began thinking about sport differently. “Sports demand structured thinking, constant learning, and adaptation,” he says. That mindset led to systems that could scale. Chetan, a co-founder of SportsSkill, brought operational experience across sports management, FMCG, and media. Together, they built SportsSkill as a platform to track, record, and guide athletes selected under Chance2Sports. SportsSkill is free for all athletes supported by the foundation. It is used to log training, upload match videos, track progress, and share personalised feedback. It was built not as a standalone product, but as a tool to strengthen the mentoring ecosystem under Chance2Sports. Striking a balance between loss and responsibility Abhinav’s father passed away while he was still in school, leaving a void that shaped his early years. Sport became the one constant holding his life together. Noticing this, his mother and elder brother, Ambuj Sinha, stepped in without question. “I was only playing; they were the ones arranging everything,” he tells The Better India. Travel, entry fees, equipment, and logistics turned into shared family efforts. “We did not have much, but they made sure I reached the tournament, no matter how far it was,” he says. Every competition required planning and sacrifice. Sport was never treated as a distraction. It became a commitment the family carried together. In 2009, while studying in Pune, Abhinav became the first player from his city to compete at both the Asian Junior Championships and the World Junior Championships. “That was my first serious exposure to what real squash looked like,” he recalls. “The level was far ahead of what we had back home, and it opened my eyes completely.” Abhinav began by coaching small groups of children from humble backgrounds in Pune. Competing internationally revealed gaps he could no longer ignore. India had talent, but little structure. Coaching pathways felt uneven. Training around fitness, nutrition, and mental strength lacked consistency. The gap between promise and performance stood out clearly. That realisation stayed with him and slowly grew into a long-term vision. Choosing uncertainty over comfort After graduating, Abhinav took up a hedge fund role in 2013. It promised stability, a clear career path, and a strong income, much like what was expected in a family rooted in law. Yet the work never sat comfortably with him. “Financially, it was sensible,” he says with a laugh. “But it was not about money. I did not want to spend the rest of my life saying, ‘I could have tried.’” In 2014, he stepped away and returned fully to the sport. He travelled extensively, competing in Professional Squash Association (PSA) tournaments and learning from coaches across countries. Australia stood out. “They were doing everything differently, whether it was fitness, match preparation, or mental work,” he says. “It was a culture of excellence.” By 2016, coaching became his full-time focus. National titles followed in 2019 and 2020 in the Coaches’ Category, but recognition never shaped his direction. “If a system does not exist, you build it,” he says. Planting the seeds of Chance2Sports Abhinav began by coaching small groups of children from humble backgrounds in Pune. His first initiative, Rolling Nicks Sports Foundation, turned Thube Park into the city’s first free squash court. By 2022, the work evolved into Chance2Sports Foundation, co-founded with Chetan Desai. “Children from tier-2 towns or modest homes don’t lack talent,” Abhinav says. “They lack exposure, structure, and someone to believe they deserve world-class training.” The system is built on mutual respect. “Nothing is free. They earn it through their dedication and hard work,” he explains. Athletes receive support with training, travel, and competition, alongside guidance from senior figures in Indian squash. Athletes receive support with training, travel, and competition, alongside guidance from senior figures in Indian squash. Today, Chance2Sports supports around 20–30 athletes from regions such as Pune, Kalamb, Aurangabad, and Assam. The foundation is supported by individual sports professionals, including Deb Kanga, Navan Pandole, Anil Nayar, and Chetan Mehrotra. “Depth matters more than numbers,” Abhinav says. “These athletes are our proof of concept.” His coaching philosophy rests on building the whole athlete. Fitness, nutrition, mental conditioning, and discipline sit alongside technique. “If you want to produce champions, you must train the human being,” he says. Since 2017, athletes from his system have won several national titles. Many of these have come from girls. “Seven national titles, all by girls,” he says, smiling. “I am lucky to have worked with such driven young women.” Every session has a purpose Anika Dubey was in Class 10 when she joined Abhinav’s programme in 2021. She already played squash, but something felt incomplete. “I wanted to take my game to the next level,” she says. “I had the base, but I needed sharper technique and proper movement.” One match early in her training stayed with her. She found herself two games down against an older opponent. “I did not think I could come back,” Anika recalls. At that moment, Abhinav simplified the task. “He told me, ‘Win this game. Do not think of the match. Give everything to this one game.’” She did. And the shift was immediate. “Every session has a purpose,” she says. “He focuses on precision and movement quality. He teaches discipline, how to face challenges, and how not to be scared. He is a mentor more than a coach.” That focus extends far beyond city courts. In Kalamb, a small town in Maharashtra, cousins Viraj and Vedant (both 10 years old now) began training at the age of seven. “When they started playing squash, neither they nor we knew much,” their family says. “Coach Abhinav taught them proper technique, fitness, and movement. Basically, everything.” Training soon became structured. “He makes us upload videos, write what we learnt, and track our training,” Viraj says. Today, Chance2Sports supports around 20–30 athletes from regions such as Pune, Kalamb, Aurangabad, and Assam. SportsSkill plays a central role here. Athletes upload videos, receive feedback, and follow personalised modules. Abhinav coaches some athletes directly, while others receive regular guidance through recorded analysis. “Technology should shrink the distance between talent and guidance,” he says. SportsSkill today serves over 300 active users across 10–12 cities, with more than 1,000 downloads. “It allows me to coach at scale without losing personal connection,” Abhinav says. Today, both Viraj and Vedant are ranked in the Top 8 nationally in the under-11 category. “I never imagined we could compete like this,” Vedant says. Anika trained in Pune. Viraj and Vedant trained in Kalamb. Different courts, different starting points. What connected them was the routine. Sessions were structured. Guidance was consistent. Over time, the results began to show. Building cities, not just athletes The same approach began shaping entire training environments. When Abhinav arrived in Pune, only a select few juniors played squash. By 2018, more than 200 children were actively playing the sport, with 50–100 competing at national tournaments. At the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, his work followed a similar pattern. Between 2016 and 2019, he coached 10 juniors into the national top 10. “I wanted the whole city to grow,” he says. “Not just a handful of athletes.” Beyond tournaments and rankings, he cultivated a culture where the sport became a community. Learning to lift each other up As the number of players grew, Abhinav focused on responsibility. “When you give young athletes proper exposure, their confidence changes completely,” he says. When Anika won prize money for an Asian medal, his advice surprised her. “Spend 95 percent on yourself. Give five percent to the next generation.” “He wants us to understand responsibility,” Anika explains. “Not charity. Just responsibility.” Viraj’s father noticed the shift early. “They understand now that helping others is part of becoming better players,” he says. The future of Indian squash The landscape today looks far brighter than when Abhinav began. Squash is in the Olympics, likely in India’s Commonwealth Games, and grassroots tournaments span dozens of cities. Abhinav coaches some athletes directly, while others receive regular guidance through recorded analysis. “The next 10 years will be very exciting,” he says. Looking ahead, his attention stays on early development. “Fitness, motor skills, nutrition, and basic movement must begin between the ages of five and 10. If you get the fundamentals right, success becomes possible.” For Abhinav, the larger purpose remains unchanged. “My job is not to make every child a champion,” he says. “It is to make sure their years in sport are not wasted.” Across cities and small towns, that approach is taking root. “I never imagined this opportunity,” Vedant says. “I just wanted to play, but now I see where I can go.” Anika echoes the sentiment. “Abhinav sir taught me more than squash. He taught me life. I will carry the learnings with me always.” All pictures courtesy Abhinav Sinha", "source": "positive_news_the_better_india", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://thebetterindia.com/sports/abhinav-sinha-squash-coach-uttar-pradesh-free-training-system-tier-2-players-mentoring-india-10992889", "published_date": "2026-01-13T02:30:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T04:02:31.522304", "language": "en", "tags": ["sustainability", "Sports", "social_good", "Changemakers", "innovation", "india", "Explore all stories", "positive_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "The Better India : Latest Posts", "source_category": "positive_news", "word_count": 1764, "author": "Raajwrita Dutta", "raw_content_length": 19448, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 8.82, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "7596fbd173decc4fed68235463073074", "_belonging_signals": ["elder", "rooted"], "_signal_count": 2}

If he gets to power, I believe he will take the country to a certain point in terms of development. We just need to trust him and allow him to bring out his potential,\" Steven Bagasha Byaruhanga tells the BBC at a packed opposition rally in a village in south-western Uganda.\nAlthough Ndyasima Patrick supports the status quo, he was also at the rally, presumably to hear what Bobi Wine has to say. But Patrick wasn't swayed.\n\"I support President Yoweri Museveni in this election because he has kept us alive all these years. He may have been in power for a long time but we haven't got the right one yet. Bobi Wine seems qualified but this is not his time yet, maybe 2031,\" he says.\nThursday's presidential election is a rematch of the 2021 contest with 81-year-old Museveni, in power for four decades, being challenged once again by the relatively youthful former pop star, 43-year-old Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.\nThe campaign's high energy is a reminder that in a country where the median age is just 17, politics is overwhelmingly fuelled by the young.\nForty years ago, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were in their pomp, Diego Maradona lifted the World Cup for Argentina, Whitney Houston had a smash hit with The Greatest Love of All and rebel leader Yoweri Museveni seized power in Uganda.\nFor the vast majority of Ugandans, those other figures only live on in the memories of their parents but Museveni remains the only president they have known.\nThe ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) is campaigning under the slogan \"Protecting the Gains\", urging continuity and stability.\n\"Look at Uganda - 40 years ago, we were among the biggest exporters of refugees in all neighbouring countries surrounding us. Right now, Uganda is the biggest host of refugees in Africa,\" NRM spokesperson Emmanuel Lumala Dombo tells the BBC, as he lists the gains his party is seeking to defend.\nBobi Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), on the other hand, is mobilising the electorate with the slogan \"Protest Vote\", a message that emphasises urgency and generational change.\n\"This election is about liberation, it's about freedom, it's about people asserting their voices,\" says Bobi Wine, who has become the most prominent political conduit for youth frustration.\nBoth appeals are aimed at the same young audience, but they imagine Uganda's future in fundamentally different ways.\nMuseveni's search for a seventh successive election victory underscores the paradox.\nUganda is one of the youngest countries in the world, but its political system is dominated by leaders who came to power decades ago and have never left.\nThis tension is not unique to Uganda.\nAcross much of Africa, youthful societies remain governed by ageing elites who have successfully outmanoeuvred constitutional limits and political pressure to step aside.\nUganda's youth bulge is both its greatest asset and its most volatile risk.\nEach year, hundreds of thousands of young people enter the labour market, but the economy struggles to absorb them.\nGenuine opportunities to change things, meanwhile, remain tightly controlled.\nProtest is often met with arrests, intimidation and violence - a response that has only deepened anger rather than suppressed it.\nAcross the region, young people are no longer waiting quietly.\nIn neighbouring Kenya, youth-led protests over governance and economic hardship have shaken the political establishment.\nIn Tanzania, long regarded as politically subdued, new forms of activism are emerging and protests over last year's elections left many dead.\nMozambique has experienced violent unrest fuelled by unemployment and inequality.\nAnd in Madagascar, the military took over last year after youth-led protests caused the president to flee.\nThese developments are being closely watched in Uganda, both by young activists seeking inspiration, and by a government determined to prevent similar unrest.\nAgainst this backdrop, many observers see Thursday's election less as a genuine search for public legitimacy and more as a managed security operation aimed at containing dissent.\nFergus Kell, research fellow with the London-based Chatham House think tank has written about a \"heavily militarized\" politics where the NRM has used \"state machinery to protect its own authority by suppressing alternative centres of power\".\nMuseveni is widely expected to win. Uganda's electoral history, with observers frequently criticising how free and fair the polls actually were, suggests that a different outcome is unlikely.\nLast week, the UN's human rights office said the elections would \"take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition, human rights defenders, journalists and those with dissenting views\".\nNetherlands-based academic Prof Kristof Titeca says the \"rituals of democratic competition\" are on show but the \"outcome is predetermined\".\nMany contend that this year's vote has seen less electoral violence than the last one when at least 54 people died.\nOne reason may be that the 2021 election was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when the authorities here enforced restrictions more strictly.\nBeyond the two leading camps, several smaller opposition parties are also contesting the election, though with far less visibility and organisational reach.\nLong-established parties such as the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and the Democratic Party (DP) continue to field presidential candidates and parliamentary hopefuls, drawing on older support bases, particularly among urban professionals and sections of the middle class.\nBut years of internal divisions have left them struggling to compete, and though unlikely to alter the outcome of the presidential race, these parties continue to shape local contests and parliamentary dynamics.\nFor many younger voters, however, these traditional opposition parties are seen as part of an earlier political era, unable to channel the urgency and confrontational feeling that now defines youth-led activism.\nBeyond the predictable result, the January election highlights a more fundamental question: What happens after Museveni?\nThe tension running through the campaign betrays a regime unsettled by the prospect of life after an octogenarian president.\n\"Only a fool or a snake-oil salesman would claim to have a single definitive answer. Many outcomes are possible,\" wrote one of Uganda's most seasoned journalists, Charles Onyango-Obbo, three years ago, when considering the post-Museveni era.\nSpeculation about Museveni's retirement plans has persisted for 25 years.\n\"Ever since 2001, we've been having transitional elections. But every hint of departure has been followed by constitutional amendments including the removal of presidential term limits and age limits - reforms that have enabled him to remain in office indefinitely,\" says political analyst Monday Akol Amazima.\nMore recently, the clearest indications of an impending shift have surfaced inside the centres of power themselves, particularly within the armed forces.\nAt the heart of this is Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, whose growing prominence has recast long-standing questions about succession into more immediate and tangible ones.\nHis swift accumulation of authority, coupled with an increasingly public profile, has made the prospect of a hereditary transfer of power a central feature of political debate.\nAfter taking command of the land forces in 2021, Gen Kainerugaba's rise accelerated rapidly.\nBy the middle of the decade, he was overseeing the entire military, even as he cultivated a national following beyond the barracks.\nIn 2022, he traversed the country with a series of highly choreographed \"birthday\" parties for himself that doubled as political rallies, before unveiling the Patriotic League of Uganda party, an organisation widely interpreted as a testing ground for his future political ambitions.\nDespite speculation that he might run for the presidency, he later declared allegiance to his father's re-election bid. However, his messaging continues to position him as a leader-in-waiting.\nThe shift became more pronounced in March 2024, when Gen Kainerugaba initiated sweeping changes within the senior ranks of the military.

But Patrick wasn't swayed.\n\"I support President Yoweri Museveni in this election because he has kept us alive all these years. He may have been in power for a long time but we haven't got the right one yet. Bobi Wine seems qualified but this is not his time yet, maybe 2031,\" he says.\nThursday's presidential election is a rematch of the 2021 contest with 81-year-old Museveni, in power for four decades, being challenged once again by the relatively youthful former pop star, 43-year-old Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.\nThe campaign's high energy is a reminder that in a country where the median age is just 17, politics is overwhelmingly fuelled by the young.\nForty years ago, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were in their pomp, Diego Maradona lifted the World Cup for Argentina, Whitney Houston had a smash hit with The Greatest Love of All and rebel leader Yoweri Museveni seized power in Uganda.\nFor the vast majority of Ugandans, those other figures only live on in the memories of their parents but Museveni remains the only president they have known.\nThe ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) is campaigning under the slogan \"Protecting the Gains\", urging continuity and stability.\n\"Look at Uganda - 40 years ago, we were among the biggest exporters of refugees in all neighbouring countries surrounding us. Right now, Uganda is the biggest host of refugees in Africa,\" NRM spokesperson Emmanuel Lumala Dombo tells the BBC, as he lists the gains his party is seeking to defend.\nBobi Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), on the other hand, is mobilising the electorate with the slogan \"Protest Vote\", a message that emphasises urgency and generational change.\n\"This election is about liberation, it's about freedom, it's about people asserting their voices,\" says Bobi Wine, who has become the most prominent political conduit for youth frustration.\nBoth appeals are aimed at the same young audience, but they imagine Uganda's future in fundamentally different ways.\nMuseveni's search for a seventh successive election victory underscores the paradox.\nUganda is one of the youngest countries in the world, but its political system is dominated by leaders who came to power decades ago and have never left.\nThis tension is not unique to Uganda.\nAcross much of Africa, youthful societies remain governed by ageing elites who have successfully outmanoeuvred constitutional limits and political pressure to step aside.\nUganda's youth bulge is both its greatest asset and its most volatile risk.\nEach year, hundreds of thousands of young people enter the labour market, but the economy struggles to absorb them.\nGenuine opportunities to change things, meanwhile, remain tightly controlled.\nProtest is often met with arrests, intimidation and violence - a response that has only deepened anger rather than suppressed it.\nAcross the region, young people are no longer waiting quietly.\nIn neighbouring Kenya, youth-led protests over governance and economic hardship have shaken the political establishment.\nIn Tanzania, long regarded as politically subdued, new forms of activism are emerging and protests over last year's elections left many dead.\nMozambique has experienced violent unrest fuelled by unemployment and inequality.\nAnd in Madagascar, the military took over last year after youth-led protests caused the president to flee.\nThese developments are being closely watched in Uganda, both by young activists seeking inspiration, and by a government determined to prevent similar unrest.\nAgainst this backdrop, many observers see Thursday's election less as a genuine search for public legitimacy and more as a managed security operation aimed at containing dissent.\nFergus Kell, research fellow with the London-based Chatham House think tank has written about a \"heavily militarized\" politics where the NRM has used \"state machinery to protect its own authority by suppressing alternative centres of power\".\nMuseveni is widely expected to win. Uganda's electoral history, with observers frequently criticising how free and fair the polls actually were, suggests that a different outcome is unlikely.\nLast week, the UN's human rights office said the elections would \"take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition, human rights defenders, journalists and those with dissenting views\".\nNetherlands-based academic Prof Kristof Titeca says the \"rituals of democratic competition\" are on show but the \"outcome is predetermined\".\nMany contend that this year's vote has seen less electoral violence than the last one when at least 54 people died.\nOne reason may be that the 2021 election was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when the authorities here enforced restrictions more strictly.\nBeyond the two leading camps, several smaller opposition parties are also contesting the election, though with far less visibility and organisational reach.\nLong-established parties such as the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and the Democratic Party (DP) continue to field presidential candidates and parliamentary hopefuls, drawing on older support bases, particularly among urban professionals and sections of the middle class.\nBut years of internal divisions have left them struggling to compete, and though unlikely to alter the outcome of the presidential race, these parties continue to shape local contests and parliamentary dynamics.\nFor many younger voters, however, these traditional opposition parties are seen as part of an earlier political era, unable to channel the urgency and confrontational feeling that now defines youth-led activism.\nBeyond the predictable result, the January election highlights a more fundamental question: What happens after Museveni?\nThe tension running through the campaign betrays a regime unsettled by the prospect of life after an octogenarian president.\n\"Only a fool or a snake-oil salesman would claim to have a single definitive answer. Many outcomes are possible,\" wrote one of Uganda's most seasoned journalists, Charles Onyango-Obbo, three years ago, when considering the post-Museveni era.\nSpeculation about Museveni's retirement plans has persisted for 25 years.\n\"Ever since 2001, we've been having transitional elections. But every hint of departure has been followed by constitutional amendments including the removal of presidential term limits and age limits - reforms that have enabled him to remain in office indefinitely,\" says political analyst Monday Akol Amazima.\nMore recently, the clearest indications of an impending shift have surfaced inside the centres of power themselves, particularly within the armed forces.\nAt the heart of this is Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, whose growing prominence has recast long-standing questions about succession into more immediate and tangible ones.\nHis swift accumulation of authority, coupled with an increasingly public profile, has made the prospect of a hereditary transfer of power a central feature of political debate.\nAfter taking command of the land forces in 2021, Gen Kainerugaba's rise accelerated rapidly.\nBy the middle of the decade, he was overseeing the entire military, even as he cultivated a national following beyond the barracks.\nIn 2022, he traversed the country with a series of highly choreographed \"birthday\" parties for himself that doubled as political rallies, before unveiling the Patriotic League of Uganda party, an organisation widely interpreted as a testing ground for his future political ambitions.\nDespite speculation that he might run for the presidency, he later declared allegiance to his father's re-election bid. However, his messaging continues to position him as a leader-in-waiting.\nThe shift became more pronounced in March 2024, when Gen Kainerugaba initiated sweeping changes within the senior ranks of the military. Such decisions had historically been the preserve of the presidency, not an active service chief.\nBy moving to reorder the command structure and improving retirement benefits, he signalled both an expansion of his authority and an effort to secure it, neutralising potential resistance while embedding loyalists in strategic roles across the security apparatus.\nYet NRM spokesperson Dombo downplays suggestions that Museveni is grooming his son as an heir.\nHe insists the party has clear internal processes for leadership succession, adding that if Gen Kainerugaba were to express interest in a political position through the NRM, he would be required to follow those established channels.\n\"Whether Gen Muhoozi would want to exploit his advantage as a military leader, he should also know that there are other things he must still prove, so that the combination of them can portray him as a leader he may choose to be,\" Dombo says.\nBobi Wine, for his part, remains sceptical that Museveni is preparing to step aside.\nHe draws parallels with Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe, who clung to power into his 90s before being removed by the military.\n\"Just like Mugabe, and all these other dictators.

{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_cf7e9bdb68fb", "title": "Meet the UP Coach Training 300+ Squash Players & Creating Champions From Small Towns", "content": "“My father taught me that if you set out to do something, you must do it with complete dedication, or not at all,” says Abhinav Sinha (35), his voice calm yet unflinching. “In sport, you cannot do things half-heartedly. If you choose the path, you walk it with absolute intent.” Prayagraj, his hometown, mirrors that belief in many ways. The city sits at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna, shaped by centuries of faith and routine. Ancient ghats (riverfront steps), narrow lanes, and the steady rhythm of life by the river framed Abhinav’s childhood. Born into a family of lawyers, discipline and expectation were part of daily life. The assumption was clear. Education, stability, and a respected profession would define his future. Sport, especially squash, did not feature in that plan. There were no squash academies in the city and no formal coaching pathways. Fast-forward to today, and Abhinav has trained over 300 athletes, supported multiple national champions, and built a pipeline of talent emerging from tier-2 towns across India. Through Chance2Sports Foundation, which he co-leads with Chetan Desai, and SportsSkill, a tech-enabled platform created to support the foundation’s athletes, Abhinav is widening access to a sport long seen as exclusive. Hunger, discipline, and consistency matter more here than privilege or postcode. When frustration turns into partnership The partnership between Abhinav and Chetan grew out of shared frustration with the Indian sports ecosystem. “Chetan and I came together because we were both experiencing the same problem from opposite ends,” Abhinav says. “I was coaching athletes and trying to track progress through Excel sheets, while international academies were recording and analysing every session in detail. I knew we were missing critical information.” Abhinav has trained over 300 athletes, supported multiple national champions, and built a pipeline of talent emerging from tier-2 towns across India. Abhinav began thinking about sport differently. “Sports demand structured thinking, constant learning, and adaptation,” he says. That mindset led to systems that could scale. Chetan, a co-founder of SportsSkill, brings 50 years of experience in tennis, as well as operational expertise across sports management, FMCG, and media. Together, they built SportsSkill as a platform to track, record, and guide athletes selected under Chance2Sports. SportsSkill is free for all athletes supported by the foundation. It is used to log training, upload match videos, track progress, and share personalised feedback. It was built not as a standalone product, but as a tool to strengthen the mentoring ecosystem under Chance2Sports. Striking a balance between loss and responsibility Abhinav’s father passed away while he was still in school, leaving a void that shaped his early years. Sport became the one constant holding his life together. Noticing this, his mother and elder brother, Ambuj Sinha, stepped in without question. “I was only playing; they were the ones arranging everything,” he tells The Better India. Travel, entry fees, equipment, and logistics turned into shared family efforts. “We did not have much, but they made sure I reached the tournament, no matter how far it was,” he says. Every competition required planning and sacrifice. Sport was never treated as a distraction. It became a commitment the family carried together. In 2009, while studying in Pune, Abhinav became the first player from his city to compete at both the Asian Junior Championships and the World Junior Championships. “That was my first serious exposure to what real squash looked like,” he recalls. “The level was far ahead of what we had back home, and it opened my eyes completely.” Abhinav began by coaching small groups of children from humble backgrounds in Pune. Competing internationally revealed gaps he could no longer ignore. India had talent, but little structure. Coaching pathways felt uneven. Training around fitness, nutrition, and mental strength lacked consistency. The gap between promise and performance stood out clearly. That realisation stayed with him and slowly grew into a long-term vision. Choosing uncertainty over comfort After graduating, Abhinav took up a hedge fund role in 2013. It promised stability, a clear career path, and a strong income, much like what was expected in a family rooted in law. Yet the work never sat comfortably with him. “Financially, it was sensible,” he says with a laugh. “But it was not about money. I did not want to spend the rest of my life saying, ‘I could have tried.’” In 2014, he stepped away and returned fully to the sport. He travelled extensively, competing in Professional Squash Association (PSA) tournaments and learning from coaches across countries. Australia stood out. “They were doing everything differently, whether it was fitness, match preparation, or mental work,” he says. “It was a culture of excellence.” From Pune to Mumbai, and from Kalamb to many small towns, young players have begun to find direction and confidence through the sport. By 2016, coaching became his full-time focus. National titles followed in 2019 and 2020 in the Coaches’ Category, but recognition never shaped his direction. “If a system does not exist, you build it,” he says. Planting the seeds of Chance2Sports Abhinav began by coaching small groups of children from humble backgrounds in Pune. His first initiative, Rolling Nicks Sports Foundation, turned Thube Park into the city’s first free squash court. By 2022, the work evolved into Chance2Sports Foundation, co-founded with Chetan Desai. “Children from tier-2 towns or modest homes don’t lack talent,” Abhinav says. “They lack exposure, structure, and someone to believe they deserve world-class training.” The system is built on mutual respect. “Nothing is free. They earn it through their dedication and hard work,” he explains. Athletes receive support with training, travel, and competition, alongside guidance from senior figures in Indian squash. Athletes receive support with training, travel, and competition, alongside guidance from senior figures in Indian squash. Today, Chance2Sports supports around 20–30 athletes from regions such as Pune, Kalamb, Aurangabad, and Assam. The foundation is supported by individual sports professionals, including Deb Kanga, Navan Pandole, Anil Nayar, and Chetan Mehrotra. “Depth matters more than numbers,” Abhinav says. “These athletes are our proof of concept.” His coaching philosophy rests on building the whole athlete. Fitness, nutrition, mental conditioning, and discipline sit alongside technique. “If you want to produce champions, you must train the human being,” he says. Since 2017, athletes from his system have won several national titles. Many of these have come from girls. “Seven national titles, all by girls,” he says, smiling. “I am lucky to have worked with such driven young women.” Every session has a purpose Anika Dubey was 10 years old when she joined Abhinav’s programme in 2021. She already played squash, but something felt incomplete. “I wanted to take my game to the next level,” she says. “I had the base, but I needed sharper technique and proper movement.” One match early in her training stayed with her. She found herself two games down against an older opponent. “I did not think I could come back,” Anika recalls. At that moment, Abhinav simplified the task. “He told me, ‘Win this game. Do not think of the match. Give everything to this one game.’” She did. And the shift was immediate. “Every session has a purpose,” she says. “He focuses on precision and movement quality. He teaches discipline, how to face challenges, and how not to be scared. He is a mentor more than a coach.” That focus extends far beyond city courts. In Kalamb, a small town in Maharashtra, cousins Viraj and Vedant (both 10 years old now) began training at the age of seven. “When they started playing squash, neither they nor we knew much,” their family says. “Coach Abhinav taught them proper technique, fitness, and movement. Basically, everything.” Training soon became structured. “He makes us upload videos, write what we learnt, and track our training,” Viraj says. Today, Chance2Sports supports around 20–30 athletes from regions such as Pune, Kalamb, Aurangabad, and Assam. SportsSkill plays a central role here. Athletes upload videos, receive feedback, and follow personalised modules. Abhinav coaches some athletes directly, while others receive regular guidance through recorded analysis. “Technology should shrink the distance between talent and guidance,” he says. SportsSkill today serves over 300 active users across 10–12 cities, with more than 1,000 downloads. “It allows me to coach at scale without losing personal connection,” Abhinav says. Today, both Viraj and Vedant are ranked in the Top 8 nationally in the under-11 category. “I never imagined we could compete like this,” Vedant says. Anika trained in Pune. Viraj and Vedant trained in Kalamb. Different courts, different starting points. What connected them was the routine. Sessions were structured. Guidance was consistent. Over time, the results began to show. Building cities, not just athletes The same approach began shaping entire training environments. When Abhinav arrived in Pune, only a select few juniors played squash. By 2018, more than 200 children were actively playing the sport, with 50–100 competing at national tournaments. At the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, his work followed a similar pattern. Between 2016 and 2019, he coached 10 juniors into the national top 10. “I wanted the whole city to grow,” he says. “Not just a handful of athletes.” Beyond tournaments and rankings, he cultivated a culture where the sport became a community. Learning to lift each other up As the number of players grew, Abhinav focused on responsibility. “When you give young athletes proper exposure, their confidence changes completely,” he says. When Anika won prize money for an Asian medal, his advice surprised her. “Spend 95 percent on yourself. Give five percent to the next generation.” “He wants us to understand responsibility,” Anika explains. “Not charity. Just responsibility.” Viraj’s father noticed the shift early. “They understand now that helping others is part of becoming better players,” he says. The future of Indian squash The landscape today looks far brighter than when Abhinav began. Squash is in the Olympics, likely in India’s Commonwealth Games, and grassroots tournaments span dozens of cities. Abhinav coaches some athletes directly, while others receive regular guidance through recorded analysis. “The next 10 years will be very exciting,” he says. Looking ahead, his attention stays on early development. “Fitness, motor skills, nutrition, and basic movement must begin between the ages of five and 10. If you get the fundamentals right, success becomes possible.” For Abhinav, the larger purpose remains unchanged. “My job is not to make every child a champion,” he says. “It is to make sure their years in sport are not wasted.” Across cities and small towns, that approach is taking root. “I never imagined this opportunity,” Vedant says. “I just wanted to play, but now I see where I can go.” Anika echoes the sentiment. “Abhinav sir taught me more than squash. He taught me life. I will carry the learnings with me always.” All pictures courtesy Abhinav Sinha", "source": "positive_news_the_better_india", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://thebetterindia.com/sports/abhinav-sinha-squash-coach-uttar-pradesh-free-training-system-tier-2-players-mentoring-india-10992889", "published_date": "2026-01-13T02:30:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T12:05:08.159617", "language": "en", "tags": ["Changemakers", "sustainability", "Sports", "social_good", "Explore all stories", "innovation", "india", "positive_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "The Better India : Latest Posts", "source_category": "positive_news", "word_count": 1796, "author": "Raajwrita Dutta", "raw_content_length": 19972, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 8.98, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "ec70777de03694ed82b00397dc8b7379", "_belonging_signals": ["elder", "rooted"], "_signal_count": 2}
{"id": "arabic_middleeasteye_c38fbacf0f44", "title": "How Israel and the US are exploiting Iranian protests", "content": "How Israel and the US are exploiting Iranian protests Submitted by Hamid Dabashi on Mon, 01/12/2026 - 21:38 Genuine rage over economic stagnation is being manipulated to serve western political ends Iranian protesters participate in a pro-Government rally in Tehran, Iran, on 12 January, 2026 (Reuters) On Since protests erupted across Iran late last year, more than 500 people have been killed, according to data from the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which has been cited by major media outlets worldwide. The agency reports that most of the dead were protesters, alongside more than 45 members of Iran’s security forces. While HRANA and western media are not totally reliable sources in this regard, it has nonetheless become apparent that a significant new cycle of protest is unfolding inside Iran. BBC Persian in particular appears to be on a UK state-sponsored mission to exaggerate the extent of these protests. It systematically ignores a significant part of the Iranian population that both disagrees with state policies, but refuses to take its cues from Israel or its unleashed stooge, Reza Pahlavi. This is yet another example of UK soft power in service of Israel. BBC Persian’s obsessive coverage of the Iranian protests is deeply intertwined with its policy of pathologically ignoring Israel’s genocide in Palestine. While Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has publicly acknowledged the ongoing protests, he has noted that there must be a distinction between those who have legitimate economic grievances against the state, and those who are taking advantage of the movement to promote other nefarious goals, such as regime change and the disintegration of Iran. That is the Israeli project. By all accounts, this new cycle of protests is both genuine, and heavily manipulated, at the same time. Economic crisis On the first point, the protests are rooted in the deep economic crisis Iran has experienced for decades. These economic troubles are due to two complementary factors: internal state corruption and incompetence, and crippling external sanctions imposed by the US and other countries. As a recent Financial Times headline aptly summarised: “Iran’s currency ‘turns to ash’ as economy spirals”. At the same time, this particular crisis is mostly (but not entirely) a manufactured distraction led by Israel and the US. Once again, they are targeting a dysfunctional state - like Lebanon, Syria, Yemen or Venezuela - to sustain themselves in power and distract global attention from the still-unfolding genocide in Gaza. Iranians have every right and reason to protest their harsh and untenable economic and political conditions. The impoverished and disappearing middle class has endured extreme hardships, as the working class breaks down under unfathomable deprivation. Tel Aviv thinks that the more regional chaos and confusion it generates, the faster the world will forget and move on from the Gaza genocide But Israel’s focus on Iran today is triggered by multiple factors. First and foremost, it is a diversionary tactic, aimed at shifting global attention from the ongoing Israeli genocide of Palestinians, and the state’s systematic theft of what remains of the occupied West Bank. Tel Aviv thinks that the more regional chaos and confusion it generates, the faster the world will forget and move on from the Gaza genocide. The second, related objective is the disintegration of Iran into smaller ethnic states, similar to Israel’s designs for other regional countries, such as Lebanon and Syria. Tel Aviv wants to remake the whole region in its own image - that of a garrison state. Its wicked recognition of “Somaliland” is a blueprint for this scenario. The issue of the Iranian nuclear programme is a red herring. There was a nuclear agreement between Iran and the outside world, crafted under the Obama administration. Israel consistently opposed that deal, including through its fifth column inside the US, Aipac. Working against the best interests of both the US and Iran, President Donald Trump swiftly dismantled it upon taking office. Israel is thus primarily responsible for the absence of a nuclear deal between Iran and the outside world. Crippling sanctions Meanwhile, the US remains chiefly responsible for using crippling sanctions as a weapon against Iran’s ruling elite and impoverished masses alike. Two reasons underpin the sanctions: trumped-up concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme, and American-European pressure on Tehran to assume a less belligerent and more pro-Israel stance in the region. The fact that Israel, while posing as the most ardent nemesis of Iran’s ruling Islamic Republic, is itself a nuclear power engaged in a multi-front battle against its neighbours - particularly against Palestinians, who are trapped in their own homeland - is of course missing from this reading of the region. Compared with past waves of unrest, the current protests have not yet reached the scale, significance or authenticity of the 2022 Women, Life, Freedom uprising. That seminal and iconic event is still a matter of scholarly conversations, but the fact that it was an event of colossal significance, precisely because it was led by women, remains undisputed. The current protests are exceptionally violent, and are certainly not led by women. The Mahsa Amini uprising was perhaps the last genuine, homegrown and authentic protest movement in modern Iranian history - one with global significance. In contrast, the latest protests are irredeemably polluted by Mossad agents, with mosques set ablaze to enrage and agitate, giving a pretext for Islamophobic commentary from the likes of JK Rowling. The protests are also marred by fake news, which Israel has long employed in an attempt to dismantle the Iranian government for its own ends. According to investigations by Haaretz, TheMarker and Citizen Lab, Israeli hasbara is actively engaged in manufacturing support for Reza Pahlavi, the demented son of the last Pahlavi monarch. Top Israeli officials continuously encourage revolt against the Iranian state, even as such instigations discredit the resulting unrest. Still, aspects of the latest demonstrations are real and potentially consequential. State survival The Iranian state is now in survival mode. But wrestling with one crisis after another is in the DNA of the Islamic Republic; it basks in them. In the aftermath of the June US-Israeli attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities and other civilian targets, the state will ruthlessly crack down on these protests, and it will not hesitate to bring the battle to US regional bases and directly to Israel. The first exchange of missiles in this context will suddenly and radically change the scenario. In the meantime, the protests appear to be unfolding in a blind fury. The state has either detained or forced into exile all legitimate and reasonable voices that could have led these demonstrations in the best interests of the nation. Iranian protests are not for 'regime change' but for relief from US economic war Read More » In the absence of peaceful and legitimate options - figures like Mir Hossein Mousavi, Zahra Rahnavard, Mohammad Khatami, Mostafa Tajzadeh or Abolfazl Qadiani - the space is open for illegitimate and opportunistic pro-Pahlavi monarchists and the Mojahedin-e-Khalq, neither of which have any meaningful popular base inside Iran. And as western media outlets like the BBC and Wall Street Journal continue to manufacture a popular base for the Zionist stooge Pahlavi, the Iranian state is expecting an attack by the US, as Trump has threatened, or Israel, or both. While the protests started at least in part from inside, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on record as saying that Mossad agents have been involved. It’s not clear whether this is genuine, or a psy-op gimmick aiming to unnerve Iranian authorities; either way, it muddies the waters. At its core, this movement is not a revolution, but an attempted disinformation coup crudely masterminded by the US and Israel. Modelled on the CIA-MI6 coup of 1953 against an elected prime minister, the Americans can provide the military might, while the British, through outlets like BBC Persian, can supply the fake news. The uprising began for real and legitimate reasons, but Israel is trying to hijack it. Just as it stole Palestine to make room for its garrison state, and stole Judaism to justify Zionism, Israel is now attempting to steal another country’s social uprising.

If he gets to power, I believe he will take the country to a certain point in terms of development. We just need to trust him and allow him to bring out his potential,\" Steven Bagasha Byaruhanga tells the BBC at a packed opposition rally in a village in south-western Uganda.\nAlthough Ndyasima Patrick supports the status quo, he was also at the rally, presumably to hear what Bobi Wine has to say. But Patrick wasn't swayed.\n\"I support President Yoweri Museveni in this election because he has kept us alive all these years. He may have been in power for a long time but we haven't got the right one yet. Bobi Wine seems qualified but this is not his time yet, maybe 2031,\" he says.\nThursday's presidential election is a rematch of the 2021 contest with 81-year-old Museveni, in power for four decades, being challenged once again by the relatively youthful former pop star, 43-year-old Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.\nThe campaign's high energy is a reminder that in a country where the median age is just 17, politics is overwhelmingly fuelled by the young.\nForty years ago, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were in their pomp, Diego Maradona lifted the World Cup for Argentina, Whitney Houston had a smash hit with The Greatest Love of All and rebel leader Yoweri Museveni seized power in Uganda.\nFor the vast majority of Ugandans, those other figures only live on in the memories of their parents but Museveni remains the only president they have known.\nThe ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) is campaigning under the slogan \"Protecting the Gains\", urging continuity and stability.\n\"Look at Uganda - 40 years ago, we were among the biggest exporters of refugees in all neighbouring countries surrounding us. Right now, Uganda is the biggest host of refugees in Africa,\" NRM spokesperson Emmanuel Lumala Dombo tells the BBC, as he lists the gains his party is seeking to defend.\nBobi Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), on the other hand, is mobilising the electorate with the slogan \"Protest Vote\", a message that emphasises urgency and generational change.\n\"This election is about liberation, it's about freedom, it's about people asserting their voices,\" says Bobi Wine, who has become the most prominent political conduit for youth frustration.\nBoth appeals are aimed at the same young audience, but they imagine Uganda's future in fundamentally different ways.\nMuseveni's search for a seventh successive election victory underscores the paradox.\nUganda is one of the youngest countries in the world, but its political system is dominated by leaders who came to power decades ago and have never left.\nThis tension is not unique to Uganda.\nAcross much of Africa, youthful societies remain governed by ageing elites who have successfully outmanoeuvred constitutional limits and political pressure to step aside.\nUganda's youth bulge is both its greatest asset and its most volatile risk.\nEach year, hundreds of thousands of young people enter the labour market, but the economy struggles to absorb them.\nGenuine opportunities to change things, meanwhile, remain tightly controlled.\nProtest is often met with arrests, intimidation and violence - a response that has only deepened anger rather than suppressed it.\nAcross the region, young people are no longer waiting quietly.\nIn neighbouring Kenya, youth-led protests over governance and economic hardship have shaken the political establishment.\nIn Tanzania, long regarded as politically subdued, new forms of activism are emerging and protests over last year's elections left many dead.\nMozambique has experienced violent unrest fuelled by unemployment and inequality.\nAnd in Madagascar, the military took over last year after youth-led protests caused the president to flee.\nThese developments are being closely watched in Uganda, both by young activists seeking inspiration, and by a government determined to prevent similar unrest.\nAgainst this backdrop, many observers see Thursday's election less as a genuine search for public legitimacy and more as a managed security operation aimed at containing dissent.\nFergus Kell, research fellow with the London-based Chatham House think tank has written about a \"heavily militarised\" politics where the NRM has used \"state machinery to protect its own authority by suppressing alternative centres of power\".\nMuseveni is widely expected to win. Uganda's electoral history, with observers frequently criticising how free and fair the polls actually were, suggests that a different outcome is unlikely.\nLast week, the UN's human rights office said the elections would \"take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition, human rights defenders, journalists and those with dissenting views\".\nNetherlands-based academic Prof Kristof Titeca says the \"rituals of democratic competition\" are on show but the \"outcome is predetermined\".\nMany contend that this year's vote has seen less electoral violence than the last one when at least 54 people died.\nOne reason may be that the 2021 election was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when the authorities here enforced restrictions more strictly.\nBeyond the two leading camps, several smaller opposition parties are also contesting the election, though with far less visibility and organisational reach.\nLong-established parties such as the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and the Democratic Party (DP) continue to field presidential candidates and parliamentary hopefuls, drawing on older support bases, particularly among urban professionals and sections of the middle class.\nBut years of internal divisions have left them struggling to compete, and though unlikely to alter the outcome of the presidential race, these parties continue to shape local contests and parliamentary dynamics.\nFor many younger voters, however, these traditional opposition parties are seen as part of an earlier political era, unable to channel the urgency and confrontational feeling that now defines youth-led activism.\nBeyond the predictable result, the January election highlights a more fundamental question: What happens after Museveni?\nThe tension running through the campaign betrays a regime unsettled by the prospect of life after an octogenarian president.\n\"Only a fool or a snake-oil salesman would claim to have a single definitive answer. Many outcomes are possible,\" wrote one of Uganda's most seasoned journalists, Charles Onyango-Obbo, three years ago, when considering the post-Museveni era.\nSpeculation about Museveni's retirement plans has persisted for 25 years.\n\"Ever since 2001, we've been having transitional elections. But every hint of departure has been followed by constitutional amendments including the removal of presidential term limits and age limits - reforms that have enabled him to remain in office indefinitely,\" says political analyst Monday Akol Amazima.\nMore recently, the clearest indications of an impending shift have surfaced inside the centres of power themselves, particularly within the armed forces.\nAt the heart of this is Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, whose growing prominence has recast long-standing questions about succession into more immediate and tangible ones.\nHis swift accumulation of authority, coupled with an increasingly public profile, has made the prospect of a hereditary transfer of power a central feature of political debate.\nAfter taking command of the land forces in 2021, Gen Kainerugaba's rise accelerated rapidly.\nBy the middle of the decade, he was overseeing the entire military, even as he cultivated a national following beyond the barracks.\nIn 2022, he traversed the country with a series of highly choreographed \"birthday\" parties for himself that doubled as political rallies, before unveiling the Patriotic League of Uganda party, an organisation widely interpreted as a testing ground for his future political ambitions.\nDespite speculation that he might run for the presidency, he later declared allegiance to his father's re-election bid. However, his messaging continues to position him as a leader-in-waiting.\nThe shift became more pronounced in March 2024, when Gen Kainerugaba initiated sweeping changes within the senior ranks of the military. Such decisions had historically been the preserve of the presidency, not an active service chief.\nBy moving to reorder the command structure and improving retirement benefits, he signalled both an expansion of his authority and an effort to secure it, neutralising potential resistance while embedding loyalists in strategic roles across the security apparatus.\nYet NRM spokesperson Dombo downplays suggestions that Museveni is grooming his son as an heir.\nHe insists the party has clear internal processes for leadership succession, adding that if Gen Kainerugaba were to express interest in a political position through the NRM, he would be required to follow those established channels.\n\"Whether Gen Muhoozi would want to exploit his advantage as a military leader, he should also know that there are other things he must still prove, so that the combination of them can portray him as a leader he may choose to be,\" Dombo says.\nBobi Wine, for his part, remains sceptical that Museveni is preparing to step aside.\nHe draws parallels with Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe, who clung to power into his 90s before being removed by the military.\n\"Just like Mugabe, and all these other dictators. He will not step down, I can guarantee you. Because he believes this country belongs to him and his family,\" the opposition leader argues.\nThese days, the memory of Museveni's rise to power and challenge to dictator Idi Amin has little emotional pull.\nAgainst that backdrop, the election has taken on a significance that extends well beyond individual candidates.\nIt has become a referendum on whether to preserve an established order rooted in historical achievement and or respond to a younger generation's insistence on inclusion, fairness and meaningful participation in public life.\nWhat is unmistakable is that Uganda's youth are no longer passive observers.", "source": "global_news_BBC_world", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77k8pym06zo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "2026-01-13T00:22:34", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T16:04:45.224274", "language": "en", "tags": ["news", "current_events", "global", "international", "politics", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "BBC News", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 11, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 84, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 2, "reading_time_minutes": 0.055, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 84, "fetched_content_length": 10668, "content_improvement_ratio": 127.0}, "content_hash": "2b85571baf6c10b94fda63bd51eaaf1e", "_belonging_signals": ["village", "rooted"], "_signal_count": 2}

So hat sich Familie über die Jahrhunderte verändert", "content": "Würde ein alter Römer eine Zeitreise in unsere Gegenwart machen und bei deiner Familie am Frühstückstisch landen, wäre er wohl ziemlich verwirrt – obwohl das Wort »Familie« aus dem Lateinischen kommt. Doch im Römischen Reich waren Familien oft größer. Der Begriff meinte all diejenigen, die auf einem Hof oder in einem Haus arbeiteten und lebten, beispielsweise auch Dienerinnen und Sklaven. Eine Familie, die aus nur zwei oder drei Menschen besteht, gab es selten.\n»Die Idee von Familie hat sich im Laufe der Jahrhunderte immer wieder verändert«, sagt Norbert F. Schneider. Er ist Familiensoziologe. Das heißt, er forscht dazu, wie Familien funktionieren und sich entwickeln. »Im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert bekam eine verheiratete Frau durchschnittlich sechs bis sieben Kinder. Die waren schon deshalb nötig, weil die Zeiten damals hart waren. Die Hygiene der Menschen war schlecht, die medizinische Versorgung auch. Viele Säuglinge starben kurz nach der Geburt«, sagt Schneider. Kinder waren Arbeitskräfte. Wer älter als drei Jahre alt war, musste mit anpacken. Erst kümmerten sich die Eltern um die Kinder, später war es andersherum. Wer keine Kinder bekommen konnte, wusste oft nicht, wer ihn im hohen Alter versorgen sollte.\n»Familie« meinte in der Antike nicht nur Blutsverwandte, sondern auch Sklaven und Diener. Auf diesem Altar aus dem Jahr 9 vor Christus ist die Familie des römischen Kaisers Augustus zu sehen.\nFoto: Dmitri Pronchenko / ddpAll das hat sich grundlegend geändert, erklärt der Experte: »Heute können viele von uns selbst bestimmen, wie unser Leben aussehen soll: wen wir heiraten, ob wir Kinder kriegen wollen – und, wenn ja, wie viele.« In Deutschland gehört zu einer Familie inzwischen meist nur noch ein Kind. Weltweit gesehen liegen wir damit unter dem Durchschnitt.\nIm Römischen Reich waren Familien oft riesig. Schließlich umfasste der Begriff damals auch Dienerinnen und Sklaven. Über die Jahrhunderte hat sich das Konzept »Familie« immer wieder verändert. Was heute dahintersteckt und warum Kinder in Teilen Kanadas bis zu 16 Großeltern haben, steht in der neuen Ausgabe von DEIN SPIEGEL, dem Nachrichten-Magazin für Kinder. Außerdem im Heft: Was ist 2025 passiert? Der Jahresrückblick im Quiz. Und: wie Spürhund Clyde bedrohte Tierarten sucht. DEIN SPIEGEL gibt es am Kiosk, ausgewählte Artikel online. Erwachsene können das Heft auch hier kaufen:\nAb dem 19. Jahrhundert war klar geregelt, welches Familienmitglied wofür zuständig war. Der Vater ging arbeiten, die Mutter kümmerte sich um Kinder und Haushalt – zumindest dann, wenn sich die Familie das leisten konnte. Das stand bis 1958 sogar im Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch. In vielen Familien sind die Aufgaben zwar immer noch so verteilt. Dennoch gibt es heute viele Mütter, die das Geld verdienen, Väter, die den Haushalt schmeißen, und Familien, in denen beide beides machen. Bei alleinerziehenden Elternteilen ist oft eine Person für alles zuständig.\n»Vor 50 bis 70 Jahren war klar, wie eine ›richtige‹ Familie auszusehen hat: Vater, Mutter, Ehe, gemeinsamer Haushalt, Kinder. Heute kennen wir viele verschiedene Familienmodelle. Familie ist bunter geworden, vielfältiger«, sagt Experte Norbert F. Schneider.\nVon Großeltern bis zu Enkelkindern: Bei Bauernfamilien mussten alle mit anpacken. Das Foto aus dem Jahr 1922 zeigt drei Generationen bei der Heuernte.\nFoto: Klaus Matwijow / SZ Photo / Bridgeman Art LibraryManche Eltern trennen sich, ziehen ihre Kinder allein oder mit einem neuen Partner groß. Viele Kinder kriegen so nicht nur ein zusätzliches Elternteil, sondern auch neue Stiefgeschwister. Solche Patchwork-Familien werden in Deutschland immer häufiger. Andere Kinder haben zwei Väter oder zwei Mütter. In vielen dieser Regenbogenfamilien gibt es ein Elternteil, der das Kind geboren, und einen anderen, der es adoptiert hat. Familie ist heute die Gemeinschaft von Eltern und Kindern. Dabei spielt es keine Rolle, ob die Kinder leiblich oder adoptiert sind, ob es mehrere Elternteile gibt oder welches Geschlecht sie haben.\nSie gibt Geborgenheit und geht einem manchmal doch ziemlich auf die Nerven: Familie. DEIN SPIEGEL und die Drogeriemarkt-Kette ROSSMANN suchen eure Familiengeschichten – als Comic. Weitere Infos und das Teilnahmeformular findest du hier.\nIn Teilen Kanadas leben einige Kinder sogar mit vier Eltern und acht Großeltern: Dort können sich seit einigen Jahren vier Personen als soziale Eltern eines Kindes in dessen Geburtsurkunde eintragen. Das Gesetz ermöglicht es, ein Kind ohne Partner, aber stattdessen mit Freundinnen großzuziehen. Auch in den Niederlanden wird dieses sogenannte Co-Parenting, also »geteilte« oder »gemeinsame soziale Elternschaft«, beliebter. In Deutschland geht das offiziell nicht. Trotzdem müsse man nicht zwingend miteinander verwandt sein, um eine Familie zu sein, sagt Soziologe Norbert F. Schneider. Manche bezeichnen ihre engsten Freundinnen und Freunde deshalb auch als »Wahlfamilie«.\nBerühmtes Schwesternpaar: Anna und Elsa aus dem Disney-Film »Frozen« schlagen sich nach dem Tod ihrer Eltern allein durch\nFoto: Mary Evans / IMAGO»Wichtig ist: Beim Thema Familie gibt es kein Richtig oder Falsch«, sagt der Experte. In den vergangenen Jahrzehnten habe sich das Konzept von »being family« zu »doing family« gewandelt, also vom »Familie sein« zu »Familie leben«. Während man vor 100 Jahren blutsverwandt sein musste, geht es heute darum, wie man Familie gestaltet – ganz vielseitig. Zu dem Thema gibt es in der Politik nach wie vor unterschiedliche Meinungen. Einige befürworten weiterhin das traditionelle Modell, in dem der Vater die Familie ernährt. Dennoch steht im jüngsten Bericht des Bundesfamilienministeriums: »Familie ist dort, wo Menschen dauerhaft Verantwortung füreinander übernehmen.« Also dort, wo man in schwierigen Zeiten füreinander da ist, sich umeinander kümmert, sich aufeinander verlassen kann. Das kann bei der Familie sein, in die man hineingeboren wurde. Oder bei Freundinnen und Freunden, die sich wie Geschwister anfühlen.\nLiebe Eltern,\nKinder wollen die Welt verstehen.

{"id": "austrian_die_presse_c389f91854fd", "title": "„Drecksau“: Wenn Opa viel schimpft, darf er die Enkel nicht sehen [premium]", "content": "Es sind schwere Vorwürfe, die die Eltern erheben. Der Opa soll dem kleinen Enkel einen Porno am Handy gezeigt haben. Oder ihm gesagt haben, dass ihn das Kind „schon ganz geil“ mache und er in den neu gekauften Jeans einen „geilen Arsch“ habe. Auch ein sexueller Übergriff wurde dem Großvater vorgeworfen.\nDa sich diese Vorwürfe nicht beweisen ließen, gewährten zwei Instanzen Opa und Oma Besuche bei den Enkeln, einem dreijährigen Mädchen und einem vierjährigen Buben. Der Oberste Gerichtshof (OGH) jedoch hob die Entscheidung auf. Denn man müsse auch noch klären, inwieweit der Opa seine Schwiegertochter beschimpfe. Etwa als „Drecksau“, wie die Mutter der Kinder beklagte. Und das waren noch nicht die einzigen Konfliktpunkte.\nDie väterlichen Großeltern mischen sich laut den Eltern stark in Erziehungsfragen ein, da gehe es auch um die Religion und den Nachnamen der Kinder. Das störe auch ihre Paarbeziehung, betonten die Eltern. Der Opa gehe zudem jeden Tag bis zu achtmal am Haus der Familie vorbei, um sie einzuschüchtern. Und er zeige sich den Kindern und der Mutter täglich am Weg zum Kindergarten. Die Oma wiederum würde sich unkritisch mit dem Opa solidarisieren.\nDas Bezirksgericht Oberpullendorf gewährte den Großeltern ein Kontaktrecht. Alle zwei Wochen sollen sie die Enkel für zwei Stunden sehen. Zunächst im Rahmen einer professionellen Besuchsbegleitung, nach einem halben Jahr auch ungestört, wenn bis dahin alles klappe. Der Opa aber solle die Enkel auch dann nur im öffentlichen Raum und in Anwesenheit der Oma sehen, solange der Bub noch nicht sechs Jahre alt ist. Den Eltern trug das Gericht eine zehnstündige Elternberatung auf.\nDas Bezirksgericht befand mit Blick auf ein psychologisches Gutachten, dass ein Übergriff des Großvaters auf das Kind sehr fraglich sei. Der Aussage des Kinds sei wenig Gewicht beizumessen, da es klein und von der Mutter suggestiv befragt worden sei. Den Großeltern wurde geraten, „das Haus der Familie nicht näher zu umkreisen“, da dies nicht zur Deeskalation beitrage. Das Landesgericht Eisenstadt bestätigte das Besuchsrecht. Denn der Kontakt zum Opa gefährde die Kinder nicht in ihrer Entwicklung.\nDer OGH betonte, dass Großeltern grundsätzlich ein Besuchsrecht zu Enkeln hätten. Der alleinige Umstand, dass Großeltern und Eltern sich nicht verstehen, reiche „grundsätzlich nicht für eine Versagung oder Einschränkung des Kontaktrechts“ zu Oma und Opa aus. „Wenn das Wohl des Kindes den persönlichen Kontakt mit den Großeltern wünschenswert erscheinen lässt, muss nämlich auch von den Eltern verlangt werden, dass sie eine Atmosphäre schaffen, die einen solchen Kontakt ermöglicht.“\nAber das großelterliche Kontaktrecht habe Grenzen, und zwar bei schwerwiegenden Konflikten und Spannungen. So sollen Opa und Oma nicht zu Besuch kommen, wenn dies „die Familienbeziehung innerhalb der Kernfamilie stören oder einen Loyalitätskonflikt bedeuten würde“.\nGerade um einen solchen Vorwurf gehe es aber hier, sagte der OGH. Die Eltern würden um das Wohl der Kinder und um ihre Paarbeziehung fürchten. Laut den Vorwürfen mache der Opa die Schwiegertochter schlecht, er beschimpfe sie öffentlich und werfe ihr Manipulation ihres Partners vor. Dies, während die Oma sich unkritisch mit dem Opa solidarisiere. Durch den Stress könnten sogar schwerwiegende körperliche Schäden drohen: So macht die Mutter geltend, dass sie an Multipler Sklerose erkrankt sei und weitere Schübe vermeiden wolle.\nAuch diese Vorwürfe müsse man daher genau prüfen, und das hätten die ersten beiden Instanzen unterlassen, mahnte der OGH (1 Ob 129/25i). Das Bezirksgericht solle nun Opa, Oma und die Eltern zu diesen Themen vernehmen.

What constitutes \"country\" can also impact how we perceive of patriotism, as there's a difference between the land, the people, the ideals, and the current government. And then there's nationalism, which may sound like the same thing but isn't. So what's the difference? Episcopal priest Joseph Yoo shared his thoughts on what separates patriotism from nationalism, and people are appreciating having the key differences laid out so clearly. @joseph.yoo Nationalism vs. Patriotism #yourEpiscoPal #YourKoreanFather #nationalism #patriotism #LanguageLearning \"Patriotism is love,\" Yoo begins. \"It's gratitude. It's saying, 'I care about my country enough to tell the truth about it, to celebrate what's good and work to fix what's broken.\"\"Nationalism, that's idolatry,\" he continues. \"It says my nation is the nation above critique, above others, God's favorite. And once you slap God's seal of approval on your own flag, congratulations, you've just made your country a 'golden calf.'\" He explained the patriotism results in activism like that of John Lewis crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge to demand that the country live up to its professed ideals. Nationalism results in tragedies like the January 6th invasion of the Capitol, where Confederate flags and crosses were seen in the same mob. — (@) \"Patriotism says, 'I love my family enough to admit when we've messed up, and I will help us grow,\" Yoo says.\" Nationalism says, 'My family is perfect, everyone else is trash, and if you disagree you are out.\"\"One is honest love. The other is toxic possession,\" he says. \"One builds. One bullies.\"Yoo concluded with a biblical point: \"Jesus never called us to worship a flag, only to love our neighbor.\"It's important to differentiate between patriotism and nationalism because the latter has become a bit of a lightning rod in the political discourse. Some use it as a pejorative term, while others have embraced it as something totally acceptable or even positive. When the definitions are muddied, it causes confusion. Flags can be a symbol of both patriotism and nationalism.Photo credit: CanvaOf course, Yoo is not the sole authority on what these words mean, but his thoughts are aligned with what the neutral arbiters of definitions say they mean. Dictionary.com has an entire page discussing the terms, defining patriotism as \"devoted love, support, and defense of one’s country; national loyalty,” and nationalism as \"the policy or doctrine of asserting the interests of one’s own nation viewed as separate from the interests of other nations or the common interests of all nations,\" ultimately leading to how the two words are used: \"Patriotism generally has a positive connotation. It’s used for various positive sentiments, attitudes, and actions involving loving one’s country and serving the great good of all its people.Nationalism generally has a negative connotation. It’s used for political ideologies and movements that a more extreme and exclusionary love of one’s country—at the expense of foreigners, immigrants, and even people in a country who aren’t believed to belong in some way, often racial and religious grounds.\" Love of one's country is nice. But there's a difference between patriotism and nationalism. Photo credit: CanvaBritannica also has a whole page about the two words, with this basic synopsis of the differences:\"Patriotism is a feeling of attachment and commitment to a country, nation, or political community, and its conception has roots tracing back to Greek and Roman antiquity. It is associated with the love of law and common liberty, the search for the common good, and the duty to behave justly toward one’s country. Nationalism, on the other hand, is a more modern ideology that emerged in the 18th century, focusing on the individual’s loyalty and devotion to the nation-state, often surpassing other individual or group interests.\"And then there are some famous takes on patriotism: “I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.”― James Baldwin“Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.”― Mark Twain Mark Twain had quite a bit to say about patriotism. Giphy “Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president or any other public official, save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else.”― Theodore Roosevelt“The difference between patriotism and nationalism is that the patriot is proud of his country for what it does, and the nationalist is proud of his country no matter what it does; the first attitude creates a feeling of responsibility, but the second a feeling of blind arrogance that leads to war.”― Sydney J. HarrisThere's nothing wrong with loving your country, but anything taken to excess and exclusion isn't healthy. Nationalism is excessive and exclusive in its very nature, and while patriotism can be weaponized, when kept in check it's what keeps people striving to make their homelands the best that they can be for everyone who lives there.

{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_5573ef5b4ea5", "title": "From Snake Rescues to Safer Honey Collection: These Heroes Protect the Sundarbans", "content": "Recently, when a snake slithered into one of the locals’ homes in the Dulki village of Sundarbans, Madhushree Das was the first to be dialled. Within no time, she reached the spot, reassured the family that they had nothing to worry about, rescued the snake, and then handed it over to the Forest Department. For Madhushree, this instinct has become second nature. She is one of 99 local residents known as prokriti bondhus (friends of nature) under WWF-India’s Sundarbans Delta Programme, which has been active since June 2022. The programme equips the prokriti bondhus with the skills and know-how of mitigating human-wildlife conflict, rescuing and handling snakes, and protecting their natural environment. Was Madhushree scared? Absolutely not, the pride in her voice suggests, as she recounts the unfolding of events. These SOS calls give her a sense of purpose. “Knowing that everyone knows me as a prokriti bondhu makes me feel important,” she shares, adding that it isn’t just the locals who place their faith in her but also the Forest Department. Once relegated to household tasks, Madhushree is thrilled to now be in a position where she can serve her community. The prokriti bondhus are trained to have a deep understanding of the landscape and wild of the Sundarbans Soma Saha, Lead – Communities at WWF-India’s Sundarbans Delta Programme, has witnessed this shift in agency and confidence firsthand, having had a front-row seat to the women’s journeys. While bolstering their morale, she says the programme is an extension of a time-tested commitment of the locals towards their land. “Ever since we started working in the Sundarbans in 2005, we observed how tigers and other wildlife would stray into the villages near the forest, and people in these villages would voluntarily support the Forest Department, helping the wildlife safely return to the forest while ensuring no harm to humans,” she explains. These observations inspired the Prokriti Bondhu programme in the delta. “The objective was simple: to help the volunteers who used to spontaneously support the Forest Department continue their work, while also helping the local people during these incidents of wildlife straying into human territory,” she adds. Rescuing the snakes of the delta A part of the world’s largest delta, and spanning roughly 10,000 sq km (out of which about 4,000 sq km is in West Bengal, India), the Sundarbans are known for being the world’s largest single patch of tidal mangrove forest, home to around 50 reptile species and more than 30 mammal species. But while the untrained eye spots just the beauty, the locals know better. And when Soma and her team ventured into the delta in the early 2000s, they understood why these natives lived in a constant state of uncertainty. The Sundarbans is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest “We saw the vulnerability the land was experiencing due to climate change, and poor infrastructure, transport facilities, healthcare systems, and limited livelihood opportunities; these caused the locals to depend on natural resources,” Soma shares. This, she adds, often results in human-wildlife conflict. Soma is referencing the deaths due to tiger attacks. While official records are sparse, estimates suggest that 300 people have died in such attacks since the year 2000. But while tragic, news of deaths due to tiger attacks often eclipses another crisis — deaths caused by snake bites, which receive far less attention despite being a significant public health issue. In fact, as a conversation with Padma Shri Dr Arunoday Mondal, who treats over 12,000 patients in the Sunderbans every year through his free medical service centre Sujan, shares, snake bites are a growing concern in the delta. Despite the government arranging anti-venom facilities, the doctor says the supply does not suffice. “In my experience, I have witnessed 30 people dying of snake bites every year,” he notes. Cognisant of how the delta’s untamed reality is a challenge to the people living here, WWF-India came up with the idea of turning the locals into safeguards of their own. To combat the problem of deaths due to snake bites, Soma says the prokriti bondhus are given live snake training and handling. She adds that their intervention has significantly helped put the locals' fears at ease. The prokriti bondhus are also trained in carrying out surveys using digital technologies “Previously, when people spotted a snake, they would either kill it or call the Forest Department. In cases where the Forest Department officials took time to reach the site, the locals, not knowing what to do, would eventually kill the reptile,” she shares. Not only did these attacks result in snakes being killed in large numbers, but they also gave the locals sleepless nights. But that is slowly changing, as one of the prokriti bondhus, Priyanka Mandal, shares. Having once feared the forest and snakes herself, Priyanka’s understanding of the wild has now deepened, and she credits the WWF-India programme for this, which empowers the prokriti bondhus to educate the community about the ecological importance of the reptiles. Priyanka wasn’t deterred when she learnt that the opportunity was purely voluntary; in her opinion, being taught to safeguard her land was as good an incentive as any. How the prokriti bondhus are ensuring a safer ecosystem The work of the prokriti bondhus is evident across 46 forest fringe villages in the Sundarbans. One call and they spring into action. But their work isn’t easy; it often involves dodging the pitfalls of the wild while attempting to perform their duties. Despite the nature of the job, the willingness of these prokriti bondhus surprised Soma and her team when they first set out to develop a cadre of volunteers. They distributed 10 application forms in each of the 46 forest fringe villages; over 360 people applied. WWF-India then organised village-level meetings where the applicants presented their motivations behind wanting to volunteer. Based on the presentations, 99 applicants were selected, out of which 42 per cent are women. After ensuring their families' support, in collaboration with the Forest Department, WWF-India started arranging training sessions. The trainings include the know how on mitigating human wildlife conflict Among the training imparted to them were: Identifying hoof marks and pug marks of wild animals Volunteers were taught the dos and don’ts during wildlife straying incidents Guidance was provided on whom to contact in case of such incidents Training covered the identification of different snake species Volunteers learned live snake handling techniques Dos and don’ts during snake bite incidents were also part of the training Things to remember while applying for ex gratia due to human-wildlife conflict All volunteers are covered under the Government of West Bengal’s universal basic health insurance programme, Swasthya Sathi. The prokriti bondhus are given live snake handling training Since the inception of the initiative, these prokriti bondhus have conducted 75 wildlife rescue operations (which included venomous snakes) and helped the WBFD officials during 10 tiger straying incidents, Soma shares. Meanwhile, WWF-India helps the prokriti bondhus with their livelihoods through a detailed engagement plan that supports their voluntary service while strengthening their skills and income opportunities. The prokriti bondhus are also trained in survey techniques. WWF-India assists the prokriti bondhus with vaccinations for the poultry and animals This is by way of providing capacity building on livestock rearing, including vaccination, along with hands-on training on goat breed improvement through artificial insemination. To support sustainable agriculture, agro-meteorological advisories are shared, which enable low-cost crop production. Beyond coexistence A WWF report underscores the dangers of collecting wild honey, an activity that’s rampant in the Sundarbans, with its vast mangrove ecosystem providing an untouched, diverse floral source for wild bees. The report suggests that this collection of ‘blood honey’ (referring to approximately five honey collectors dying every year in the Sundarbans due to conflict with tigers) accounts for about 34 per cent of deaths. In a bid to reduce this, WWF-India joined hands with the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) Directorate to come up with a plan. The project was conducted in the Lothian Wildlife Sanctuary in March 2017; five moulis (traditional honey collectors) were encouraged to place the apiary boxes (where beehives of honey bees can be kept and bred) in the fenced-off areas of Sundarbans as opposed to wild honey collection. The results indicated that the daily yield of honey from each apiary box was nearly double that of what was collected from wild bees, proving the exercise successful. This led to the formation of cooperatives in and around the Sundarbans, three of which sell their honey under the brand name Bonphool Wild Honey. While these and many other initiatives are helping create a safer environment in the Sundarbans delta, the prokriti bondhus remain at the heart of these efforts. This is reflected in the experiences of women like Shashthi Mandal, who says that the best part of being part of such a network is the strong sense of sisterhood it brings. “We work on so many rescues together, but doing it with other women makes me happy. It makes me proud.” This story is part of a content series by The Better India and WWF-India.

{"id": "arabic_middleeasteye_275a33c9d47c", "title": "Israeli social media erupts with calls for overthrowing Iran's government", "content": "Israeli social media erupts with calls for overthrowing Iran's government Submitted by Nadav Rapaport on Sun, 01/11/2026 - 10:30 Israeli politicians and influencers have openly welcomed the latest wave of protests, with some advocating for military intervention in order to access the Islamic Republic's natural resources Protesters gather amid evolving anti-government unrest at Vakilabad highway in Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan province, Iran, on 10 January 2026 (Social media via Reuters) Off Israeli social media has filled with open calls for the overthrow of the Iranian government, as protests spread across the Islamic Republic and authorities imposed a near-total internet blackout. While Israel's political leadership has largely remained silent on the demonstrations, former Israeli officials, commentators and activists have openly celebrated the prospect of overthrowing the government in Tehran, framing the unrest as an historic opportunity. According to Israeli media reports, security agencies have advised politicians not to comment on the protests, warning that public statements could cause \"significant damage\" by legitimising Iran's narrative that the unrest is being orchestrated by Israel and the United States. Despite those warnings, former far-right Knesset member Moshe Feiglin wrote on X that \"sooner or later the regime in Iran will fall\", arguing that the key question was who would shape the post-Islamic Republic order. \"The question is who will be the moral beacon that will help this to happen and will shape the other regimes,\" he said. \"The State of Israel, with the capacity to become a regional power, or American interests that told us 'don't' when Iran was already on its knees,\" he added, referring to last June's direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. Right-wing Israeli activist Yoseph Haddad also welcomed the protests, sharing an image of himself with supporters of Iran's former monarchy. \"God willing, soon we will be able to wave these two flags together side by side in Tehran,\" he wrote, referring to the Israeli flag and the pre-1979 Iranian tricolour. \"Our peoples will be able to live in true coexistence again when Iran's Islamic regime is thrown into the dustbin of history,\" Haddad added. Other Israeli commentators framed the protests in explicitly economic terms, describing Iran as a \"dormant energy and minerals giant\" with vast gas and mineral reserves. One popular right-wing account suggested that foreign intervention could be justified in order to access Iran's resources, writing that a decisive moment might warrant \"a little military assistance\" in exchange for future economic benefits. Such statements echo longstanding Israeli and Western discussions about Iran's strategic value, even as protesters inside the country insist their demands are rooted in economic survival and political dignity rather than geopolitics. Left-wing Israelis, however, expressed solidarity with protesters while warning against attempts to instrumentalise the uprising or romanticise authoritarian alternatives. \"It is very hard to describe the range of emotions\" caused by the images from Iran, Israeli journalist Orly Noy wrote on Facebook. \"The hope I did not allow myself to nurture for so long, that perhaps I might one day be able to visit my homeland again,\" Noy said, before warning against growing support for Iran's exiled former crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, among Israeli and diaspora audiences. Noy criticised what she described as the aggression and intolerance of Pahlavi's online supporters, saying their behaviour raised concerns about the nature of any political alternative to the current regime. Another left-wing Israeli activist wrote that while his \"heart is with the protesters\", Israel would likely seek a new regional enemy if Iran were no longer able to play that role. Such a shift, he warned, could help Israel continue framing its treatment of Palestinians as self-defence, pointing to rising tensions with Turkey and the collapse of normalisation efforts with Saudi Arabia. Protests escalate Inside Iran, protests that began nearly two weeks ago over rising prices of basic goods have evolved into broader demonstrations against the political system. The unrest has spread to multiple cities, with demonstrators chanting slogans such as \"death to the dictator\", directly targeting Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. In response, authorities also imposed a sweeping internet blackout, a tactic used during previous uprisings to limit mobilisation. Iranian officials have also downplayed the scale of the unrest and portrayed protesters as violent vandals acting at the behest of foreign powers. Fearing backlash, Iranian Kurds wary of fully joining protests Read More » Last week, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on X: \"Happy New Year to every Iranian in the streets. Also, to every Mossad agent walking beside them.\" In a televised speech on Friday, Khamenei dismissed the protests as insignificant and accused the United States of exploiting the situation. \"The hands of the American president are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians,\" he said, referring to US President Donald Trump. Describing property damage during protests in Tehran, Khamenei added: \"A bunch of vandals destroyed a building that belongs to them to please the US president.\" Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, echoed those claims while visiting Lebanon, accusing the US and Israel of encouraging unrest to destabilise the Islamic Republic. Iran's economy has been battered by years of US-led sanctions, soaring inflation and a rapidly depreciating currency, leaving large segments of the population struggling to afford basic necessities.

He returns home to his wife and child twice a week, but says he has to be away from them at the moment to work on a project and he mostly sleeps on site.\n\"I worry that if something happened to me, I could die alone in the place I rent and no-one would know,\" he said. \"That's why I downloaded the app and I set my mum as my emergency contact.\"\nHe also added that he downloaded the app quickly after its release, fearing it would be banned because of the negative connotations around it.\nSome have been quick to bash the app's less than cheery name - saying that signing up for it might bring ill fortune.\nOthers have called for it to be changed to something with a more positive spin, like \"Are you ok?\" or \"How are you?\".\nAnd though the success of this app must be, in part, because of its catchy-sounding name, the company behind the app, Moonscape Technologies, has said it is taking on board the criticism of the current title and weighing up a potential name change.\nThe app, which is listed internationally under the name Demumu, ranks in the top two in the US, Singapore and Hong Kong, and top four in Australia and Spain for paid utility apps - possibly driven by Chinese users living overseas.\nThe current name is a word play on a successful food delivery app called \"Are you Hungry?\". In Chinese, \"Si-le-ma\" sounds like the name of the food app \"E-le-ma\".\nFirst launched as a free app, the app has now made its way into the paid category - albeit at the low price of 8 yuan ($1.15; £0.85).\nLittle is known about the founders of Are You Dead?, but they say they are three people who were born after 1995 who built the app from Zhengzhou in Henan with a small team.\nIt has certainly grown in value now. One of these men, who goes by the name Mr Guo, told Chinese media that they intended to raise money by selling 10% of the company for a million yuan. That is a lot more than the 1,000 yuan ($140) they say it cost to build the app.\nAnd they're also looking to grow their target audience - saying they are exploring the idea of a new product specifically designed for the elderly in a country where over one-fifth of its population is over the age of 60.\nIn an indication that it was seriously looking at this option, it posted over the weekend, \"we would like to call on more people to pay attention to the elderly who are living at home, to give them more care and understanding. They have dreams, strive to live, and deserve to be seen, respected and protected.\"\nThe company has not responded to questions from the BBC.", "source": "global_news_BBC_world", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3381r5nnn6o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "2026-01-12T09:55:04", "collected_date": "2026-01-12T16:00:40.003562", "language": "en", "tags": ["news", "current_events", "global", "politics", "international", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "BBC News", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 21, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 115, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 2, "reading_time_minutes": 0.105, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 115, "fetched_content_length": 4086, "content_improvement_ratio": 35.53}, "content_hash": "e7d762d9f04ba220b2fb41ffc0286876", "_belonging_signals": ["elder"], "_signal_count": 1}
{"id": "ai_quantum_magazine_1ff233f4a2b3", "title": "Cells Use ‘Bioelectricity’ To Coordinate and Make Group Decisions", "content": "Introduction\nWe’re used to thinking of the brain as an electric organ. The rest of the body? Not so much. But it would be a mistake to dismiss your other tissues as dumb hunks of electrically inert flesh. Even the protective layers of cells that compose your skin and line your organs use electrical signals to make decisions, according to recent research.\nResults published in Nature show that cells use bioelectricity to coordinate a complex collective behavior called extrusion, a vital process that ejects sick or struggling individual cells from tissue to maintain health and keep growth in check. Merciless as it might seem, extrusion helps keep you alive. It’s vital for the health of protective epithelial tissues, and when it goes wrong, it can contribute to disease, including cancer and asthma. Until now, it’s been unclear how cells were singled out for this process.\nAccording to the new results, as epithelial tissue grows, cells are packed more tightly together, which increases the electrical current flowing through each cell’s membrane. A weak, old, or energy-starved cell will struggle to compensate, triggering a response that sends water rushing out of the cell, shriveling it up and marking it for death. In this way, electricity acts like a health checkup for the tissue and guides the pruning process.\n“This is a very interesting discovery — finding that bioelectricity is the earliest event during this cell-extrusion process,” said the geneticist GuangJun Zhang of Purdue University, who studies bioelectrical signals in zebra fish development and wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s a good example of how a widening electronic-signaling perspective can be used in fundamental biology.”\nThe new discovery adds to the growing assortment of bioelectrical phenomena that scientists have discovered playing out beyond the nervous system, from bacteria swapping signals within a biofilm to cells following electric fields during embryonic development. Electricity increasingly appears to be one of biology’s go-to tools for coordinating and exchanging information between all kinds of cells.\n“People just kind of relegated [bioelectricity] to ‘This is just neurons.’ No — it’s all of our bodies,” said study author Jody Rosenblatt, an epithelial cell biologist at King’s College London and the Francis Crick Institute. “There are electrical currents going through your body all the time, and they’re doing things.”\nLife’s Spark\nIt’s no coincidence that Frankenstein’s monster sprang to life with a spark. In the late 18th century, just a few decades before Mary Shelley wrote her science fiction masterpiece, the Italian surgeon Luigi Galvani jolted the scientific community with experiments that used metal and electricity to compel disembodied frog legs to kick. He became convinced that there was an “animal electricity” running through life.\nPublic Domain\nWhile Galvani was later proven wrong in the details, he wasn’t totally off. Virtually every cell on every branch of the tree of life expends a hefty chunk of its energy budget — in some cells, more than half — on maintaining a voltage across its membrane. The voltage difference that results, called the membrane potential, stores potential energy that can be released later. It’s like the pressure behind a dam: Gravity tugs water downhill, and dams store energy by holding water at the top of a hill. Like gravity, the electrochemical force tugs charges “downhill” — positive charges stream toward negative charges and vice versa in electrical currents. Blocking that flow, for example with a cell membrane, stores up electrical potential energy.\nThe electric currents that pour from our wall sockets are streams of electrons. In cells, “it’s quite similar, but not exactly the same,” said Elias Barriga, who studies tissue biophysics at the Dresden University of Technology. “We are fueled by ions.”\nIons are atoms or molecules that carry charge because of extra or missing electrons, which give them negative or positive charges, respectively. They can enter and exit cells only through specialized protein channels and pumps. Just as hydroelectric plants can use surplus energy to pump water back up into the reservoir for later use, cells use their chemical energy to pump ions “uphill” against the electric flow. By controlling the natural current and letting positive or negative charge build up on either side of their membranes, cells maintain their membrane potential. And if this energy is used or leaks away, cells can replenish it by expending more of their chemical energy.\n“You generate a potential: what’s inside versus what’s outside, a different concentration of ions,” Barriga said. “That is the source of bioelectricity.”\nNeurons make use of this biological electricity to share information. By releasing messenger molecules called neurotransmitters that open and close ion channels, neurons can nudge their neighbors’ membrane potentials up or down. If these chemical nudges push a neuron’s membrane potential beyond a threshold, the cell “spikes” — voltage-sensitive ion channels throw open the floodgates for positive sodium ions, which rush into the cell and cause a rapid voltage swing that ripples along the neuron’s length. When that signal reaches the interface between neurons, voltage-sensitive channels open wide, triggering the release of neurotransmitters to more neurons downstream.\nMuscle contraction also kicks off with a voltage spike; neurons send electrical signals streaming into muscle fibers, triggering contractions. This is why Galvani’s electrified frog legs twitched, and why a jolt of electricity can jump-start a stopped heart. (Specialized cells in the heart use electricity to set the pace of its regular contractions.) While all tissues maintain membrane potentials, researchers don’t really know what they do. Compared to electrophysiology, which often focuses on electricity in the brain and heart, the field of bioelectricity — a grab-bag term for electrical activity everywhere else in organisms — has lagged behind, Barriga said.\n“I think that at some point it got stuck,” he said. “But now I can tell you that that is coming back like crazy.”\nA Shocking Discovery\nThe epithelial tissues that make up skin and line organs, blood vessels, and body cavities quietly burn about 25% of their available energy to maintain membrane voltages between minus 30 and minus 50 millivolts. But researchers interested in these tissues typically study mechanical forces, chemical signaling, and gene expression — not currents and voltage, Rosenblatt said.\nUntil recently, that included her. Rosenblatt has spent 25 years piecing together the details of epithelial extrusion, a process that keeps tissue growth in check. Because epithelial cells grow quickly, even a slight mismatch between the rates of cell division and cell death can quickly add up to a tumor or injury. Runaway replication can grow into cancer, while overzealous culling — as can happen in asthma — compromises the integrity of tissues. It’s important to get the balance right.\nAround 14 years ago, Rosenblatt and colleagues discovered that overcrowded epithelial cells are popped up and out of the tissue alive — extruded — to maintain that tissue balance as new cells grow. That raised a question: How does tissue “choose” which living cells to expel?\nIn earlier work, Rosenblatt’s team watched as some cells dumped their water and shriveled up like raisins before being extruded; indeed, this shrinkage seemed to kick off the process. But the researchers didn’t know what caused the cells to shrink in the first place. They didn’t work on bioelectricity and were unaware of any effect it might have.\nAntonio Tabernero\nIn further experiments, they were able to prevent the cells from shrinking by blocking a pressure-sensitive ion channel in the cell membrane that opens when squeezed. They decided to see if blocking other ion channels might interfere with extrusion too.\n“We got so many hits, we were just like: Jesus, this is crazy,” Rosenblatt recalled. One of those hits was a voltage-gated potassium channel, like those that open up during a neuron’s voltage spike. It struck Rosenblatt as “weird” enough to follow up on. Using special dyes that reveal the voltage across cell membranes, the scientists found that epithelial cells destined for extrusion — and only those cells — lose their membrane potential about five minutes before shrinking and being extruded. The result was clear: Extrusion kicks off with an electrical signal.\nInstead of sending neurotransmitters back and forth like neurons, densely packed epithelial cells squeeze each other. As the tissue gets more crowded, the squeezing intensifies. This opens pressure-sensitive ion channels, which allow positive sodium ions to leak across the squashed cells’ membranes and into the cell.\nFaced with this challenge, a healthy cell will use its chemical energy to activate pumps to push sodium back out and restore its normal voltage. But stressed or unhealthy cells without energy to spare can’t keep up. Their membrane voltage falters, throwing open those “weird” voltage-sensitive channels. When that happens, water pours out of the cell in a “lightning” flash clearly visible in microscope images, Rosenblatt said. Once a cell loses 17% or more of its volume, it is extruded. Her working hypothesis is that a biochemical cascade set off by the shrinkage contracts motor proteins, which mechanically extrude the cell.\nIn this way, bioelectrical flow across cell membranes lets tissues test which cells are the least healthy and mark them for extrusion. “They’re always pushing against each other and bullying each other. And what they’re doing is probing each other for which one’s the weakest link,” Rosenblatt said. “It’s a community effect.”\nEvolution as Electrician\nAt the University of California, San Diego, the biophysicist Gürol Süel studies electricity in bacterial biofilms, which are collectives composed of single-celled bacteria that can also survive independently. The signaling that Rosenblatt and her team described in human tissues has several things in common with electrical mechanisms Süel has described in microbes — and which appear again and again across the tree of life.\n“It’s a very elegant study, very nice results,” he said of the new research. “And conceptually, it makes sense.”\nSuel Lab\nElectricity increasingly appears to be one of evolution’s go-to solutions for integrating multiple streams of information. Epithelial tissues use it to keep tabs on crowding. Neurons compile input signals from multiple sources into a spiking output. A Venus flytrap snaps shut when sensory hairs with touch-sensitive ion channels react to prey. These channels are tuned to trigger a voltage spike and tell the trap to close only if stimulated multiple times in rapid succession.\n“The membrane potential is so fundamental, and it is very fast,” Süel said. While switching genes on and off or upping protein production could take minutes or hours, a membrane potential can flip in fractions of a second. “It tells you, in one glance almost, about the state of the cell,” he added.\nTen years ago, Süel and his team showed that microbes in biofilms can spike their membrane potentials to communicate, just as neurons do. Since then, they’ve shown that biofilms use electricity to coordinate tasks, prevent runaway growth, and invite free-swimming bacteria to join the collective. Bioelectricity can even help them avoid falling victim to the tragedy of the commons: Two biofilms sharing scarce food can send electrical signals to each other to take turns eating.\nMulticellular animals, too, use electrical signaling to organize themselves. Zhang, of Purdue, studies bioelectrical signaling in zebra fish, which develop striking extra-long tails when a certain ion channel is mutated. This suggests that electrical signaling somehow tells tissues in a developing embryo how long to grow. Michael Levin, a researcher at Tufts University, has blocked cell channels to manipulate the membrane potentials of developing worm embryos, causing genetically identical worms to develop different body plans. And last year, Barriga and his colleagues showed that frog embryos generate natural electric fields that guide the migration of specific stem cells to their proper locations in the developing embryo.\nThe failure of bioelectric processes might be an overlooked cause of disease. Cancerous cells tend to have different membrane potentials than healthy ones, and Levin has argued that some cancers might result from a breakdown in multicellularity that happens when cells can no longer use electricity to coordinate. For example, maybe they can no longer communicate the message “I’m struggling and should be extruded,” and the result is the uncontrolled growth and, ultimately, a tumor.\nSüel is convinced that bioelectricity is as old as life itself. Indeed, an electric current drives the molecular turbines that synthesize life’s universal energy currency, ATP, in every cell alive today. One leading origin-of-life scenario places the beginning at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. There, natural currents of positively charged protons could have served as a kind of primordial membrane potential and powered prebiotic chemical reactions. But whether life started with such a spark or not, bioelectricity’s ubiquity suggests it has deep evolutionary roots that we’re just beginning to unearth.\n“There are a lot of interesting things that cells are probably doing, just like this paper showed, that we just don’t know yet,” Süel said. “We have not uncovered even half of this. … There’s a lot of opportunity for discovery.”", "source": "ai_quantum_magazine", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/cells-use-bioelectricity-to-coordinate-and-make-group-decisions-20260112/", "published_date": "2026-01-12T14:58:22", "collected_date": "2026-01-12T16:00:46.067779", "language": "en", "tags": ["quantum", "physics", "Biology", "mathematics", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Quanta Magazine", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 41, "author": "Elise Cutts", "raw_content_length": 473, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.205, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 259, "fetched_content_length": 13696, "content_improvement_ratio": 52.88}, "content_hash": "94877554ecba707bca55292bb0bfea58", "_belonging_signals": ["neighborly"], "_signal_count": 1}

NPR's Leila Fadel speaks to Holly Dagres of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy about the protests.\nLEILA FADEL, HOST:\nHolly Dagres has been following the protests in Iran, grew up in Iran and is a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. She also curates a weekly newsletter called The Iranist and she joins me now. Good morning, and welcome to the program.\nHOLLY DAGRES: Thank you for having me.\nFADEL: You know, Holly, I just want to start by asking you about your family in Iran with the communications blackout. When was the last you heard from them? Do you know how they are?\nDAGRES: Well, the communications blackout started on Thursday night in Iran. And so it's basically been Thursday since we've heard from them, and it's not just me. It's Iranians across the diaspora around the world. I know that some people have been able to get a hold of their families and friends. There's been messages pouring in from Starlink if you have a friend, a neighbor or a family member, but that's only 50- to 60,000 users across a country of 90 million. So effectively, much of the country, we don't know what's happening inside, and we're all relying on Starlink.\nFADEL: This moment - these mass protests, do these feel different than what we've seen before? You know, given that Iran has been weakened on the global stage - its regional militias that it backs, Hezbollah, Hamas, have been severely decimated. I mean, and now the U.S. is threatening to strike because of Iran's deadly crackdown on protests. Does it feel different?\nDAGRES: We say this every time there's a protest that it's different, but you highlighted very eloquently why it is this time because of those issues from the outside. And I would say that, really, the sword of Damocles is hanging over the head of the Islamic Republic, and that's the United States and Israel and whether they are planning to act. But I think it's important to note that since 2022, the Woman, Life, Freedom uprising, I mean, and even before it, there's this - a consistent call for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.\nAnd it's evident through the chants of the people because there's a sense that the systemic mismanagement, corruption and repression is not going to change. It - the regime is irredeemable and irreformable. And it's not something that I just say, but we have activists on the ground, like Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi, who is now in solitary confinement, who said that this is really, right now, a fight between the survivalists of the regime and the overthrowers of the regime. So I think it's important to note that where we're at in terms of how the people inside the country feel.\nFADEL: So many protesters have been killed - 500 by some estimates at this point. I mean, how does this violence compare to what we've seen when the regime has reacted in the past to protests?\nDAGRES: Well, that is the officially confirmed number. There's credible documentation that there's been 2,000 killed, and that's considered a conservative estimate. Given that there's a blackout, it's really hard to see what's happening on the ground. And it's important to note that the regime purposely turns off communications so the world doesn't get to see what's happening, but because they've committed mass atrocities like that before, in 2019 during the 20 - November protests, it's known as Bloody November. They killed 1,500 protesters, according to Reuters. And, of course, crimes against humanity were committed during the 2022 uprising, according to the U.N. fact-finding mission.\nFADEL: Would Iranians want American intervention?\nDAGRES: Right now, what Iranians want are two things - they want to have access to the world. I think it's important that they have some sort of access through Direct-to-Cell, which is provided by Starlink, which is for their cellphones. If they have a 2020 cellphone onwards, that gives them access to Starlink directly. But more importantly, they want a democratic transition. They've been calling for this regime to go for a long time.\nWe've had activists on the ground talk about a constitutional assembly, talk about a referendum, and even Narges Mohammadi's talked about a transition. We've also heard a call for a transition from the outside as well, from former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who's offered himself as a transitional leader. I think the international community should be listening to these calls and - that are evident in the streets.\nFADEL: And what do you make of this most recent news, the president -President Trump saying that Iran has reached out for a meeting, for negotiations?\nDAGRES: Well, quite frankly, it's disturbing because if he was to make some sort of deal, and I think of Venezuela in this context, though those are very two different countries, he'd be throwing the Iranian people, who are currently risking their lives for freedom, and much of the country under the bus. And that really worries me. And I know a lot of Iranians, before the internet shutdown, watching the events in Venezuela were concerned that something similar might be their fate.\nFADEL: Holly Dagres with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and The Iranist newsletter.

Instead, he called for Washington to actively support the protesters, for example, by providing technical means to get back online despite the government's internet shutdown.\nNouripour's colleague and head of the Greens, Franziska Brantner, also called on the German government to set up an Iran summit.\nShe said members of civil society could be invited, pointing to the large Iranian diaspora living in Germany. Brantner said it would be a signal to the Iranian regime that Germany stands with civil society.\nWATCH: Demonstrations across Europe support Iran protests\nAs unrest grows in Iran, exiled Iranians and supporters gathered across Europe in solidarity.\nDemonstrators demand the justice, political change and basic human rights long denied to people in Iran.\nWhy are Iranians protesting?\nThe reasons behind the major protests that have shaken Iran over the past two weeks are manifold and complex. What started out as a localized economic protest has expanded to incorporate a litany of anti-government complaints.\nHere are some of the main causes:\n- The Iranian rial's value has collapsed, now trading at 1.4 million to $1\n- Prices have increased for staples like rice and meat\n- Inflation has been standing at around 40%\n- The government raised the price of nationally subsidized gasoline\n- As well as economic pressure, Iran's largely young population is protesting a lack of freedoms\n- Frustration has grown after millions join previous protests but saw little to no change\nThe Islamic Republic is also struggling after its regional allies — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Assad regime in Syria — have been severely weakened by Israeli attacks or their own domestic conflicts.\nIran is also still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel that saw Israeli and US strikes across the country. At the same time, the reimposition of UN sanctions over Iran's nuclear program has further weakened and isolated the country.\nEU 'looking into' news sanctions against Iran\nThe European Union is considering further sanctions against Iran in response to the violent crackdown against protesters.\n\"We stand ready to propose new, more severe sanctions following the violent crackdown on protesters,\" EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said on Monday.\nThe EU has previously imposed numerous sanctions against Iran for human rights violations, selling drones and missiles to Russia, and its nuclear program.\nGermany pushes for EU to list IRGC as terror organization\nThe German Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it was continuing with its efforts to have Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) \"listed under the EU's anti-terror sanctions regime,\" a ministry spokesperson said.\nThe IRGC is a powerful military force that is ideologically in lockstep with the theocratic regime.\nThe German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Berlin was \"working within the EU to achieve consensus\" in order to impose sanctions on the organization.\nThe ministry also condemned the internet shutdown that has now lasted longer than 84 hours.\n\"The de facto shutdown of the internet — a crucial foundation for freedom of expression and information, and also a vital platform for networking in the context of freedom of assembly — is reprehensible,\" the spokesman said.\n\"Any measures that can be taken to enable internet access, including in ways that bypass the regime, would be welcome.\"\nIran's internet shutdown passes 84 hour mark\nThe Iranian state shut down access to the internet and international calls last Thursday. On Monday, the shutdown reached the 84-hour mark, according to internet access monitor Netblocks.\n\"As Iran wakes up to a new day, metrics show the national internet blackout is past the 84 hour mark,\" it said in a post on X.\nNetblocks also shared several ways to get around the shutdown, including shortwave radio, connecting to cell coverage at borders, Starlink and satellite phones.\nPro-government counter protesters take to the streets\nTens of thousands of people joined pro-government marches on Monday in an attempt to counter the country-wide anti-government protests that have rocked the country in the past two weeks, the Associated Press reported.\nThe counter-protests came after President Masoud Pezeshkian called on government supporters to join the \"national resistance march.\"\nState television showed demonstrators marching toward Tehran's Enghelab (Revolution) Square, calling it an \"Iranian uprising against American-Zionist terrorism.\"\nWhile information about the anti-government protests has been suppressed, footage of Monday's counter-protests was aired as the government seeks to prove that it has overcome the most recent wave of unrest.\nIran's history of protest movements\nIran has had a long history of protest movements in the modern era that have shaped and re-shaped the country.\nTwo of the most significant were the 1953 plot to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and the 1979 revolution that deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought about the Islamic Republic.\nThe 1953 coup plot was the result of Operation Ajax, a US plan, with British support, to remove the prime minister who had nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, along with several other major reforms.\nThe plot was successful and saw the consolidation of power under Pahlavi, but it also created distrust of the US and the shah who was seen as their puppet.\nAnger against the shah and the lack of freedoms in the country eventually boiled over into widespread protests that included socialist, democratic and religious groups. The resulting revolution saw Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini take power and institute the Islamic Republic as a theocracy.\nSince then, there have been many protest movements, especially among young Iranians who make up the majority of the population.\nThe most significant were the 1999 student protests over the closure of a reformist newspaper that resulted in several deaths and hundreds of arrests.\nThe 2009 Green Movement against the election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad saw millions take to the street, with social media having been used as a key tool to organize the protests. Dozens were killed and thousands were arrested.\nEconomic protests in 2019 quickly turned into broader anti-government protests. The regime responded by shutting off the internet and launching a violent crackdown.\nJust three years later, the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests rocked the country following the death of 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. The mass protests proved to be a major challenge to the regime, although it ultimately survived.\nDespite a period of relative stability after the revolution, protest movements have seen an intensification in recent years, with economic hardship worsening and memories of previous government crackdowns alive in the social consciousness.\nWATCH: Iran's government intensifies crackdown on protests\nAnti-government protesters have again flooded the streets of Iran, despite the authorities resorting to lethal force against them.\nHuman-rights groups are reporting hundreds of deaths.", "source": "global_news_deutsche_welle", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.dw.com/en/iran-protests-tehran-ready-for-war-and-dialogue-with-us/live-75471666?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf", "published_date": "2026-01-12T09:15:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-12T20:02:20.190905", "language": "en", "tags": ["News", "germany", "global", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Deutsche Welle", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 38, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 210, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 0.19, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 210, "fetched_content_length": 13209, "content_improvement_ratio": 62.9}, "content_hash": "a4bb11bcf1d887e502a477d31e0fbd30", "_belonging_signals": ["village"], "_signal_count": 1}
{"id": "new_zealand_the_spinoff_3647ed35c064", "title": "Pacific profiles: Dancer Corbyn Taulealea-Huch on life after the Royal Family", "content": "The Pacific profiles series shines a light on Pacific people in Aotearoa doing interesting and important work in their communities, as nominated by members of the public. Today, we meet dancer and choreographer Corbyn Taulealea-Huch. All photos by Geoffery Matautia. Since she was seven years old, dance has been at the centre of Corbyn Taulealea-Huch’s universe. The West Auckland dancer and choreographer spent over a decade in Parris Goebel’s esteemed Royal Family Dance Crew, and has since branched out with her own crew, BEAST. We caught up over Zoom to discuss her career highlights, lessons and ambitions. Where were you born and raised? I’m 27, full Samoan, and I’m a professional hip hop dancer and choreographer. I was born and raised in West Auckland, and my grandparents are from the villages of Savai’i, Mata’utu, and Faletangaloa. I’ve got three younger brothers, and I’m the only girl. What sparked your passion for dance? I’ve been dancing for 21 years. I started dancing when I was seven, when my aunt put a group together with my cousins and me – we were called the Lil Saintz. She saw something in all of us, and we thought it was fun. We performed at many community and church events. Then I joined the Royal Family with the Palace Dance Studio. I was with them from 2010 to the end of 2020. That’s where I got all my training and knowledge. Who are some of your dance inspirations? There are a few American choreographers I grew up watching on YouTube – one is Luam. She’s amazing. I was watching her before I discovered Parris or anyone else. I’d religiously watch her videos and copy every dance move. Missy Elliott’s been a huge inspiration for me, too. She was my ride or die – I wanted to be her backup dancer so bad! The 2010s was such a big decade for the Royal Family Dance Crew, as so much of your work blew up internationally, from the Justin Bieber music videos to competitions and performances. What was that experience like? Parris is such a hard worker. She has a specific way of working and teaching – the more I was around her, the more I absorbed her work ethic. It’s just practice, practice, practice, all day, every day, no matter what. I missed out on a lot of family occasions, events and social activities. It was a massive commitment for sure, but I’m so grateful for it because it gave me the work ethic I have now. What were some highlights from that era? We did a world tour in 2017, travelling for six weeks through 12 countries. It was a full-length show, and we also got to teach in each city. I also got to perform at two Super Bowls: JLo 2020 and Rihanna 2023. That’s incredible! What was it like performing the half time show? I honestly didn’t understand just how huge it was being from New Zealand and not being the biggest sports fan [laughs]. I remember getting there and seeing how crazy it was. JLo and her team were amazing, and it was cool to perform alongside other Pacific Island dancers. When did it click for you that you could turn your passion for dance into a full-time career? I think it was when we got professional jobs with Parris. Doing those gigs – especially seeing how it was done in Los Angeles, really expanded my horizons. I saw that I could keep up with these experienced, professional dancers. The more I did those gigs, the more that feeling grew, and I started to believe I could pursue this professionally. Towards the end of my Royal Family journey, I felt that it was time to branch out and find my own style of movement outside of a crew. It’s like leaving a sports team you’ve been with for so long! What did that journey to creating your own style look like? So I left the Royal Family at the end of 2020. Honestly, I had no idea what I was gonna do, but I just wanted to go with the flow. In 2021, I went to Australia. This was the first step for me to branch out in a place that still wasn’t too far from home. Laurence and Colette Kaiwai lead a crew over there, and I joined their company, Home Base dance studio. I got to travel around Australia dancing, teaching and growing my name. I made the proper move there for just under a year, returned to New Zealand, and then I moved to London in 2023. I love London, it’s my favourite place. What inspired the move to London? I booked a job there and fell in love with the dance scene. We’d been there on the Royal Family world tour in 2017, but I only got to see a bit of it. The dance scene there is so different from America, and I really wanted to experience what the UK and Europe had to offer. So, I threw myself in the deep end and moved. I wasn’t there long – I didn’t know what to expect and wasn’t as prepared for the move as I thought, especially when you realise all your people are here in New Zealand. But I’ll definitely be going back! You’re the founder of BEAST. Tell me about that. I always wanted to have my own collective of like-minded creatives and people who understand my movement style. In 2024, when I moved home, I wanted to build something here. I knew a bunch of people, and I just reached out to a few artists and asked if they wanted to link up. This year was crazy. My team is stacked; they’re the most beautiful humans, creatives, and choreographers. It’s magic whenever we create and perform. We’re still in the building phase. I knew nothing was gonna happen overnight, but I wanted to start putting ourselves out there early on and let people know who we are. We did two full-length shows, Intro with TAPAC and then Pt II at Mangere Arts Centre. We also had our international debut at Dancechella (Australia) and Afrosoul’s inaugural festival. That was amazing. The goal is to make it a full-time gig. At the moment, it’s more seasonal – our goal for 2026 is to have more consistency and solidity. How would you describe your movement style? What’s your point of difference? One thing about my movement that hasn’t changed is that it’s quite masculine. I like to call it masculine femininity. I’m known for my strength, power, texture and body control, and I love to represent that in my movement. But in BEAST, there are 15 of us, and we’re all so different individually – different styles, heights, shapes, everything. There’s something so special when we all move together, but you have to see it in action. It can’t be described. What else do you get up to day to day outside of dance? Do you get any downtime? Moving home, you realise that being a creative is tough. I’m so used to dancing as a job, and I’d never done a 9-5. Now that I have more adult responsibilities, I need something to help make ends meet. I work part-time at CHECKS downtown and also teach. In my downtime, I love spending time with family and friends. Dance has been my focus for so long, but I also want to try a few other things… What’s keeping you inspired at the moment? In this creative stage, I’ve been choreographing a lot to Afrobeats, dancehall and Amapiano. I’m really gravitating to those genres at the moment. Also, what keeps me inspired is the positive reception from my team, family, fans, and whoever’s engaging with my craft. That makes me want to continue creating and evolving my movement practice. Ambitions for 2026 and beyond? A massive goal for BEAST is to take it internationally – I’d love for the world to see my team and what we do as a collective. For myself, I want to continue getting the work out there. When it comes to working with other artists, there are choreographers I’d love to get in front of, such as Luther Brown (Canada). A lot of this means leaving New Zealand, but it is what it is. Our motto at BEAST is homegrown – world ready. That’s our motivation to get out there no matter what.

That pepeha took my uncle’s entire lifetime to procure for us – I grew up without one. We always knew what islands our grandfather came from: Aitutaki and Palmerston Island. But my grandmother passed away when we were children, so I grew up thinking we were only Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairoa. There is always a disclaimer with this question Ko Wai Koe? Nō hea koe?

Oh, and pressing Pikipiki on vinyl. What does success look like to you? Being content and achieving your dreams so much that you need to find new ones. Having cool, reliable friends and family. Laughter and joy. Who is someone you admire? Grace Jones. What keeps you grounded? My partner and son, Mike and Kiwa. We all genuinely love hanging out with each other, we have lots of fun. What’s one whakaaro you want to leave our readers with? I came up with something the other day that I find very amusing: Music is a place, everyone is invited. But you have to be on time!

A two-month-old baby died on Sunday, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Two more children died on Monday - a four-year-old and a newborn baby aged seven days. The ministry said at least six children have died from the cold since the start of the winter season. According to the Gaza-based Government Media Office, at least 21 people, including 18 children, have died from the cold since the start of Israel's genocidal war in October 2023. All were living in makeshift displacement camps. \"We warn of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences resulting from the severe cold waves striking the Gaza Strip,\" the office said in a statement on Sunday. \"These conditions threaten a further rise in the number of victims - particularly among children, the sick and the elderly - if this catastrophic humanitarian situation continues without urgent intervention.\" During an intense two-year bombing campaign, Israel has destroyed large swathes of Gaza’s homes, hospitals and civilian infrastructure. Around 1.5 million people remain without adequate shelter today, as the ongoing Israeli blockade continues to restrict the entry of tents, mobile homes and heating supplies, in a violation of the ceasefire signed in October. According to the Shelter Cluster, an inter-agency mechanism, more than 42,000 tents and makeshift shelters were damaged between 10 and 17 December 2025 alone due to storms, affecting nearly a quarter of a million people in the besieged enclave. Jonathan Fowler, the communications director for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), stressed that the blockaded strip requires expanded relief deliveries, instead of additional restrictions imposed by Israel. Anadolu Agency quoted him as describing the situation in Gaza as \"catastrophic\" despite the ceasefire agreement. According to Fowler, the winter has only exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the enclave, as respiratory diseases are on the rise. The UN communications director added that children are amongst the most vulnerable populations. Ahmad al-Farra, director of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital, told Haaretz that there has been a surge of patients with winter-related illnesses. The doctor warned that there is a lack of flu vaccines, inhalers and antiviral medications. The director of al-Shifa Hospital, Muhammad Abu Salmiya, also told the Israeli publication that the number of patients coming to the emergency room has doubled and stands at about 800 people a day - most of them due to flu and respiratory illnesses. \"The bed occupancy rate is over 150 percent, pediatric wards are completely full, and admissions to intensive care units have increased,\" he added. Israel plans renewed Gaza offensive Meanwhile, Israeli attacks across the besieged enclave continue, with local media reporting shelling, gunfire and air strikes across Gaza. Despite the ceasefire edging towards a second phase, the Israeli military is reportedly planning a renewed offensive in March aimed at seizing additional territory and pushing the so-called Yellow Line further west towards Gaza’s coastline, according to The Times of Israel. Israel planning renewed Gaza offensive in March, report says Read More » Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said on Saturday that the group had taken a “clear decision” to dissolve the governing bodies administering Gaza and hand their responsibilities to a technocratic committee. Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement and obstructing the transition to the second phase of the US-backed plan for Gaza, which includes the deployment of an international stabilisation force. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed Turkey’s participation in the force, a stance that has reportedly discouraged other potential contributors, including Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Israel has repeatedly violated the ceasefire, killing more than 442 Palestinians over three months in nearly 1,200 documented breaches, including air strikes, shelling and the demolition of homes. Overall, Israel has killed more than 71,400 Palestinians since October 2023, with at least 171,318 others wounded.

{"id": "pubmed_120924e6d5dc", "title": "Strengthening Collaboration Between Community-Based Organizations, State Title V Agencies, and Funders by Uplifting Community-Rooted Evidence: A Qualitative Research Study.", "content": "What is considered 'evidence' in maternal and child health (MCH) has major implications for which organizations and initiatives receive funding. Despite growing recognition of the importance of community-rooted work, state and jurisdictional MCH agencies, (Title V) operate from an evidence framework that typically prioritizes empirical research and large-scale evaluations over community-rooted evidence (CRE). This study sought to examine how CRE informs decision-making within Title V agencies, understand capacity-building needs of community-based organizations (CBOs), and explore strengthening relationships between CBOs and Title V. This qualitative study interviewed Title V and CBO staff to explore current CRE perceptions and funder/CBO relationships. 16 CBO and 11 Title V staff participated in compensated interviews from February to July 2024. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, coded, and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. CBO interviewees stressed the need to reimagine misaligned funder and CBO relationships to be rooted in trust, allow CBOs agency to define metrics of success for their work, recognize the credibility of CRE including qualitative data and storytelling, and introduce more flexibility into funding opportunities and reporting structures.

{"id": "pacific_rnz_pacific_db5f7d676c58", "title": "Samoa chief suggests returning Manawanui compensation to NZ as it's not enough", "content": "Uncertainty around compensation payments for the HMNZS Manawanui marine disaster in Samoa is growing, with the paramount chief of one of the affected villages questioning whether money from the New Zealand government should be distributed at all.\nAtanoa Tusi Fa'afetai, the paramount chief of Maninoa village in the district of Si'umu, has repeatedly stated that the sum of SAT$10 million (NZD$6 million) paid by New Zealand to his government over its sunken navy vessel off the south coast of Upolu was insufficient. Other residents and matai (chiefs) also believe this.\nFollowing details revealed in letters between the Samoa and New Zealand governments, Atanoa has said returning the sum may be a better option so the Samoa government - in collaboration with affected communities like his - can put together a comprehensive compensation claim.\nThe Manawanui ship crashed into Tafitoala reef in October 2024 and spilled diesel and pollutants into the water. Residents from Maninoa, and neighbouring villages like Tafitoala in the Safata district, watched as it burned and eventually sunk less than 2km from their homes. It remains on the reef today.\nDetails disclosed in a diplomatic exchange between New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters and Samoa's former prime minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa show her government requested a payment of SAT$10 million (NZD$6 million) to its counterpart over the incident last May. The letters, released under the Official Information Act, also show both governments agreed the payment was made \"without reference to questions of liability\"\nThe letters said the payment resolved all issues arising from the sinking of the HMNZS Manawanui between the two governments \"other than issues in relation to the anticipated wreck and reef assessments\". It also said the Samoa government would not seek further payment from New Zealand \"in relation to these resolved matters\" and that the payment is in the \"context of friendship between New Zealand and Samoa\".\nAtanoa was deeply disappointed at the agreement.\nHe believed Fiame's government had let people down by signing off on the agreement. Fiame is now an independent MP in parliament following her party's loss at the September general election.\n\"We didn't know anything about what the government has been doing to represent us,\" Atanoa said.\n\"We are the people that really live in and [are] affected with the impact of this potential hazard.\"\nHe said as details had emerged over what the previous Samoa government had agreed to, it became clear those directly impacted hadn't been consulted.\n\"I don't really blame New Zealand for agreeing to what's being done because the government represents us. But in order to have full representation of our district, we need to collaborate and deliberate on the matters, to make sure that our intentions are being voiced and our perspective as well.\n\"I feel really, you know, offended about the whole situation here from the previous administration.\n\"So I will stand firm not to distribute the money, because they're still questioning this whole thing.\"\nFagailesau Afaaso Junior Saleupu, a matai from the neighbouring village of Tafitoala in the Safata district, also criticised the conduct of the former government.\nHe said a recent meeting with government officials over the compensation process revealed the population records they'd used for the district were from 2003.\nLike Atanoa, he did not believe the SAT$10 million payment was enough, particularly as he believed the wreckage of the ship should be removed. Atanoa also believed it should be removed.\nBoth men rejected comments from Toeolesulusulu Cedric Schuster, the previous government minister in charge of the Manawanui response, who said the wreck should be turned into a dive attraction.\n\"The solution from our village [is that] we know we need to remove the wreck from there because we are thinking of the future,\" Fagailesau said.\nHe said since the disaster, locals had noticed a significant decline in fish and marine life they depended on for food and income.\n\"The problem is because the decision-making is by the people who are not affected and the information they collected is not necessary for what exactly happened.\"\nFiame previously told RNZ Pacific she signed off on what was recommended by her officials.\nAt the end of last year, prime minister Laaulialemalietoa Polataivao Schmidt - who took over from Fiame in September - said the government intended to make payments to affected people by early this year.\nHowever, both Fagailesau and Atanoa said the government had told leaders in each of their districts there will be more meetings over the process.", "source": "pacific_rnz_pacific", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/583848/samoa-chief-suggests-returning-manawanui-compensation-to-nz-as-it-s-not-enough", "published_date": "2026-01-12T16:10:48", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T00:02:14.930032", "language": "en", "tags": ["regional", "pacific", "public"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "RNZ Pacific Headlines", "source_category": "pacific", "word_count": 14, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 101, "priority": 9, "update_frequency": 12, "reading_time_minutes": 0.07, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 101, "fetched_content_length": 4661, "content_improvement_ratio": 46.15}, "content_hash": "2ebea5e2299135969ce7d85b819295e1", "_belonging_signals": ["village"], "_signal_count": 1}

{"id": "us_news_axios_a239d45397d9", "title": "Scoop: Bessent told Trump that investigation of Fed chair creates a \"mess\"", "content": "A perturbed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told President Trump late Sunday that the federal investigation into the Federal Reserve chair \"made a mess\" and could be bad for financial markets, two sources familiar with the call told Axios.Why it matters: Bessent's worries about the financial fallout were somewhat realized Monday, when the dollar dropped as bond yields and the price of gold rose amid worries about political interference in the Fed.\"The secretary isn't happy, and he let the president know,\" one source familiar with Bessent's call to Trump told Axios.Sunday night, Trump appeared to distance himself from the investigation of Fed chair Jerome Powell for allegedly misrepresenting the costs of renovations to the Federal Reserve's headquarters in D.C.U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office in D.C. launched the probe without giving a heads-up to Treasury, top White House officials or the main Justice Department, sources told Axios.Driving the news: The Powell investigation is without precedent. Powell on Sunday night made a rare video statement in which he denied any wrongdoing and accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the Justice Department because he hadn't supported lowering interest rates as much or as quickly as Trump wanted.\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a key member of the Senate Banking Committee, vowed to block any action on Powell's replacement because of the investigation and said DOJ's credibility is in question.Zoom in: Bessent's concerns about the investigation aren't just rooted in the financial markets, sources say. Powell's term as chair ends in May, and the administration was hoping he would step down sooner once Trump nominated a replacement.Bessent \"thought that when the president named a new Fed chair, that Powell would go. But now that's not going to happen,\" another source said. \"Now [Powell is] dug in. This really made a mess of things.\"A Treasury spokesperson told Axios, however, that \"there is zero daylight between Secretary Bessent and President Trump. The sources in the story do not speak for the secretary.\"Bessent didn't question the need for a Powell investigation and wasn't defending the Fed chair in his talk with Trump, the sources tell Axios.The intrigue: Senior administration officials told Axios they believe the idea for the criminal investigation was launched partly at the urging of Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who denied that to Bloomberg Television early Monday.\"The DOJ is outside of my purview. This is out of my purview. I don't know anything about it, and I would defer you to the DOJ,\" Pulte told the outlet.Pulte has a reputation within the administration for overstepping, namely by pushing the president to get DOJ to criminally charge former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Leticia James, cases that so far have gone nowhere.Pulte also clashed with Bessent, but the Treasury secretary's annoyance at the Powell investigation wasn't rooted in any prior conflict, sources told Axios.What they're saying: Trump told NBC News late Sunday that \"I don't know anything about\" the subpoenas that were issued — but he made sure to take a shot at Powell.\"He's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump told the outlet.What's next: Those comments suggest that Trump probably won't rein in Pirro's investigation, insiders say, but his measured remarks also indicate he respects Bessent's position.Trump \"didn't tell Pirro to do it. But I can't say he's going to tell her to withdraw it,\" one of the sources said. \"The president is angry with Powell. What can I say?\"Another source confirmed that Trump \"heard about the subpoenas after\" the fact, but that Pirro did not go \"forward without a signal that he would be supportive.\"That signal, officials suspect, was relayed last week in a meeting in Florida between Trump and Pulte, who's a member of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.A DOJ spokesperson said the department doesn't comment on investigations, but an administration source said Pirro \"went rogue.\" A spokesperson for Pirro's office couldn't be reached.", "source": "us_news_axios", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.axios.com/2026/01/12/bessent-trump-investigation-powell-federal-reserve", "published_date": "2026-01-12T18:43:35", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T00:03:20.412215", "language": "en", "tags": ["business", "us", "top", "politics", "us_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Axios", "source_category": "us_news", "word_count": 687, "author": "Marc Caputo", "raw_content_length": 5776, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 3.435, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "08ec2ae67633b3d8ed50e805fbe2975b", "_belonging_signals": ["rooted"], "_signal_count": 1}
{"id": "us_news_axios_2dbe438c84b3", "title": "Bill Pulte: How Trump's housing regulator became an attack dog", "content": "Federal prosecutors are probing yet another Trump foe, Fed Chair Jerome Powell — and like clockwork, an increasingly familiar name from a previously little-known agency is back in the headlines: top housing regulator Bill Pulte. Why it matters: The Federal Housing Finance Agency director has been an architect of chaos in the typically more quiet role as he's set the table for investigations into some of President Trump's high-profile rivals.He laid the groundwork for accusations of fraud into New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and Fed governor Lisa Cook. All four have denied the accusations.Context: Federal prosecutors are now investigating Federal Reserve Chair Powell over the central bank's multi-billion-dollar renovation project.Powell said in a rare public statement that the DOJ served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas Friday and threatened criminal charges tied to his Senate testimony last June about renovations.The intrigue: Pulte has been putting the pressure on Powell for months, specifically urging Congress to investigate him over \"political bias\" and his \"deceptive Senate testimony.\"He claimed Powell \"lied ... before Congress\" over the renovation project, arguing it met the threshold of removal \"'for cause.'\"Pulte has also echoed Trump in publicly pushing Powell to lower interest rates.The big picture: An unlikely strongman of Trump's campaign of political combat, Pulte has emerged as an integral figure in the president's squeeze of the central bank.Read on for more about Pulte and his role in the administrationWhat Pulte has said about PowellIn a Monday interview with Fox Business' \"Mornings With Maria,\" Pulte waved off a question about the Powell probe.\"I'd refer you to the DOJ on that matter,\" he said.Pressed by host Maria Bartiromo, he said mortgage rates and \"home buying and home building\" were his priority.But speaking to reporters Jan. 9 — the same day Powell says the subpoenas were served — Pulte said, \"We do need to get rid of Jay Powell. He's a disaster.\"He continued, \"what he's caused with the building is a disgrace to the Fed. The Fed has no credibility as a result of him.\"Pulte then turned his ire to Cook, who he claimed is \"guilty as hell.\"Flashback: Pulte has been gunning for Powell for months.In July, he called for Powell to resign.On Jan. 8, he again called on Powell to \"resign, immediately.\"Two days later, Pulte predicted that \"Jerome Powell will soon be gone,\" followed by red heart, American flag and thumbs-up emojis.Pulte's accusations against Trump rivalsPulte has sent a string of criminal referrals to the DOJ targeting Cook and others.Zoom in: In his August letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi he accused Cook of falsifying \"bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statutes.\"He leveled the same charge against New York Attorney General James.Friction point: Pulte has faced heat and accusations that he is misusing his authority to make criminal referrals against Trump's political enemies.Rep. Swalwell, another of Pulte's targets, sued Pulte in November accusing him of abusing his position by scouring data to \"concoct fanciful allegations of mortgage fraud.\"And in December, the Government Accountability Office confirmed it opened an investigation into Pulte's fraud referral practices at Senate Democrats' request.Pulte's background and experiencePulte was a private equity CEO before Trump tapped him to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency.In 2011, he founded Pulte Capital Partners, a private equity firm targeting building products companies like roofers and window manufacturers.Pulte descends from housing royalty: His late grandfather, William Pulte, founded PulteGroup, one of the nation's largest homebuilders.Zoom in: As the FHFA head, he oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which support some 70% of the mortgage market. He'd also be key if Trump takes Fannie and Freddie public.Trump posted on Jan. 8 that not selling Fannie and Freddie in his first term was \"a truly great decision\", and now he was ordering his \"Representatives\" to \"BUY $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS.\"Pulte confirmed Fannie and Freddie would make those purchases. He told Bartiromo an IPO \"is still very much on the table.\"Despite leading an obscure agency, Pulte amassed a sizable following of 3 million on X, where he heaps praise on the president.Yes, but: As Axios' Ben Berkowitz and Courtenay Brown previously reported, Pulte has at times butted heads within the administration, with Politico reporting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent even threatened him with fisticuffs. He also stirred frustration for pushing Trump to pitch the idea of a 50-year mortgage, Politico and CBS News reported.Go deeper: Trump team makes mortgage fraud its newest revenge tool", "source": "us_news_axios", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.axios.com/2026/01/12/bill-pulte-housing-regulator-jerome-powell-doj", "published_date": "2026-01-12T17:13:48", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T00:03:20.423276", "language": "en", "tags": ["business", "us", "top", "politics", "us_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Axios", "source_category": "us_news", "word_count": 754, "author": "Jason Lalljee", "raw_content_length": 9755, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 3.77, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "07ad9d869b68099a9d9ccf9108278f72", "_belonging_signals": ["grandparent"], "_signal_count": 1}
{"id": "global_news_le_monde_7f422c7262c9", "title": "'The Islamic Republic of Iran is entering its final phase'", "content": "Iran has once again returned to the forefront of international news. For over two weeks, protests have shaken the country, despite the regime's use of extreme violence to suppress them. The demonstrations began with merchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar protesting the collapse of the national currency, but they have quickly taken on a political dimension and become an open challenge to the regime.\nThis wave of protest is unfolding against a backdrop of multiple crises that have deeply undermined the Islamic Republic. First, there is an economic crisis, marked by the collapse of the middle class and growing poverty among the working classes, while an oligarchy close to those in power continues to thrive on corruption and economic rent. Then, there is a political and societal crisis, highlighted by the growing rift between a largely secularized youth – seeking freedom and equality – and an authoritarian, fundamentalist and reactionary regime. Added to this are a major ecological crisis − the result of decades of mismanagement of resources − and a geopolitical and military crisis, made worse by the shifting regional balance of power ever since the terrorist attacks of October 7 and the \"12-day war\" against Israel.\nIn this explosive context, the emergence of yet another wave of protest against the regime does not come as a surprise. Over the past 20 years, Iran has seen repeated protest movements, with increasing frequency and intensity. From the outside, the systematic repression of these movements might give the impression of repeated failures, with no lasting effect on the ground. Yet this reading is overly simplistic. As exemplified by the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement, each cycle of protest has left deep marks on Iranian society and has undeniably weakened the regime. In his speeches, Ayatollah Khamenei compares the Islamic Republic to a robust, deeply rooted tree. And yet, that tree has been so hollowed out from within that it would now take very little for it to fall.\nYou have 65.46% of this article left to read.

Instead, he called for Washington to actively support the protesters, for example, by providing technical means to get back online despite the government's internet shutdown.\nNouripour's colleague and head of the Greens, Franziska Brantner, also called on the German government to set up an Iran summit.\nShe said members of civil society could be invited, pointing to the large Iranian diaspora living in Germany. Brantner said it would be a signal to the Iranian regime that Germany stands with civil society.\nWATCH: Demonstrations across Europe support Iran protests\nAs unrest grows in Iran, exiled Iranians and supporters gathered across Europe in solidarity.\nDemonstrators demand the justice, political change and basic human rights long denied to people in Iran.\nWhy are Iranians protesting?\nThe reasons behind the major protests that have shaken Iran over the past two weeks are manifold and complex. What started out as a localized economic protest has expanded to incorporate a litany of anti-government complaints.\nHere are some of the main causes:\n- The Iranian rial's value has collapsed, now trading at 1.4 million to $1\n- Prices have increased for staples like rice and meat\n- Inflation has been standing at around 40%\n- The government raised the price of nationally subsidized gasoline\n- As well as economic pressure, Iran's largely young population is protesting a lack of freedoms\n- Frustration has grown after millions join previous protests but saw little to no change\nThe Islamic Republic is also struggling after its regional allies — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Assad regime in Syria — have been severely weakened by Israeli attacks or their own domestic conflicts.\nIran is also still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel that saw Israeli and US strikes across the country. At the same time, the reimposition of UN sanctions over Iran's nuclear program has further weakened and isolated the country.\nEU 'looking into' news sanctions against Iran\nThe European Union is considering further sanctions against Iran in response to the violent crackdown against protesters.\n\"We stand ready to propose new, more severe sanctions following the violent crackdown on protesters,\" EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said on Monday.\nThe EU has previously imposed numerous sanctions against Iran for human rights violations, selling drones and missiles to Russia, and its nuclear program.\nGermany pushes for EU to list IRGC as terror organization\nThe German Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it was continuing with its efforts to have Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) \"listed under the EU's anti-terror sanctions regime,\" a ministry spokesperson said.\nThe IRGC is a powerful military force that is ideologically in lockstep with the theocratic regime.\nThe German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Berlin was \"working within the EU to achieve consensus\" in order to impose sanctions on the organization.\nThe ministry also condemned the internet shutdown that has now lasted longer than 84 hours.\n\"The de facto shutdown of the internet — a crucial foundation for freedom of expression and information, and also a vital platform for networking in the context of freedom of assembly — is reprehensible,\" the spokesman said.\n\"Any measures that can be taken to enable internet access, including in ways that bypass the regime, would be welcome.\"", "source": "global_news_deutsche_welle", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.dw.com/en/iran-protests-trump-open-to-airstrikes-wants-diplomacy/live-75471666?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf", "published_date": "2026-01-12T09:15:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T04:01:48.025026", "language": "en", "tags": ["global", "germany", "News", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Deutsche Welle", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 36, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 211, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 0.18, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 211, "fetched_content_length": 13048, "content_improvement_ratio": 61.84}, "content_hash": "a548be42bcfe237f7811499a4ea37d5b", "_belonging_signals": ["village"], "_signal_count": 1}

Dar Global announced on Monday that it had officially launched Trump Plaza Jeddah, which will include apartments, a private park, office space, and “Trump townhouses”. The project is valued at over $1bn, the statement said. “Expanding our presence in Saudi Arabia with Trump Plaza Jeddah underscores our commitment to world-class quality and iconic design,” the US president’s son, Eric, said in a statement, adding that the project reflected the Trump family’s “confidence in Jeddah as a dynamic, globally relevant city”. Ziad el-Chaar, the CEO of Dar Global, told Reuters that the projects together are valued at around $10bn. In a statement, he said the tower in Jeddah would be a “carefully curated urban ecosystem designed for global residents who want to live, work, and connect within the best address in Jeddah”. On Sunday, the Trump Organization and Dar al-Arkan real estate announced a separate project to build a sprawling 2.6 million square metre Golf resort in the Saudi city of Diriyah outside Riyadh. The deals come as Saudi Arabia looks to turbocharge its real estate sector, announcing in January that non-Saudis would be allowed to purchase property in Riyadh and Jeddah. Saudi Arabia is trying to garner foreign investor interest in sectors from AI to mining and tourism. The real estate sector underscores some of the challenges it faces amid concerns over Saudi laws and investor rights. For example, in September 2025, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman froze rents across Riyadh for five years. While some politicians in the West, including New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani, are calling for such measures amid a cost-of-living crisis, global investors say they chill property prices. It is unclear whether luxury developments will be included in the freeze. Gulf ties The Trump Organization eyes real estate deal in Saudi government development: Report Read More » Trump has denied benefitting from any of his family’s deals, but announcements are likely to increase criticism that his children are profiting from their father’s ties to Gulf governments. Dar Global opened its first US office earlier this year at Trump Tower in New York City. Dar Global is a subsidiary of the sprawling Saudi development firm Dar al-Arkan, which has close ties to the Saudi government. The company has emerged as the Trump Organization's most important overseas partner. It is involved in the construction of a Golf course and luxury hotel in Oman and a Trump International Golf Club and villas in Simaisma, a resort town some 30 kilometres north of the Qatari capital, Doha. Meanwhile, in the UAE, an 80-storey Trump hotel is being built by Dar al-Arkan featuring \"the highest outdoor pool in the world”. Trump properties outside the US are typically constructed by foreign firms. The Trump Organization makes money by selling the Trump brand name and, with it, its reputation. Those licensing fees have proven very lucrative for Trump’s children. According to The New York Times, Dar Global’s purchase of rights to the Trump name generated $21.9m for the Trump family business last year. Jeddah is the gateway to Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast, where the kingdom is building beach resorts. Diriyah is the original home of the ruling Al-Saud family and includes a mud-brick village that is a Unesco World Heritage Site. The city, a 20-minute drive from Riyadh, is undergoing a $63bn development into a luxury destination with hotels, restaurants, shops, and museums. Trump toured the site in May during his visit to the kingdom. Trump met again with the Saudi Crown prince in November when he visited the White House.

{"id": "global_news_BBC_world_a48aa246d5aa", "title": "The Indian superstar taking a shot at political greatness", "content": "The Indian superstar taking a shot at political greatness\nIndia's southern state of Tamil Nadu has a long, peculiar political tradition: here, cinema doesn't merely entertain, it also governs.\nFrom extremely successful political stints of MG Ramachandran - popularly known as MGR - and Jayalalithaa to the more ambivalent experiments of Rajnikanth, Kamal Haasan, Khushbu and Vijayakanth, the state has repeatedly seen cinema icons turn into full-time politicians. MGR and Jayalalithaa even became chief ministers.\nNow Tamil superstar C Joseph Vijay, known as \"Thalapathy\" Vijay (General Vijay), is the latest to join the list.\nHe launched his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in 2024 and soon after announced that he would retire from films to pursue politics full-time. His upcoming film this month, Jana Nayagan (The People's Hero), would be his farewell release, he said.\nVijay's reasoning was explicit: politics, he argued, is not something one can dabble in. Tamil Nadu's voters, he said, deserved nothing less than full commitment. And the state's political history supports that calculation.\nMGR and Jayalalithaa withdrew from active stardom before consolidating power. But Kamal Haasan's hybrid approach, which involves being active in cinema and politics both, has yielded limited electoral results. Vijayakanth's party rose quickly but faltered organisationally. Tamil politics has little patience for half-measures.\nIt is against this unforgiving backdrop that Jana Nayagan arrives.\nSteeped in political imagery and rhetoric, Vijay's new film will open in nearly 5,000 cinemas across India and overseas this month. At 51, the star is stepping away from a career most actors would be reluctant to leave. He remains among Indian cinema's most bankable stars, driving festival releases and revenues across the global Tamil diaspora - from satellite rights and music to merchandise.\nChennai-based film critic Aditya Shrikrishna noted that Vijay's appeal has not rested on acting prowess alone. \"He's not a Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth in terms of filmography,\" he said. \"But his box office pull and fandom are huge and undeniably influential. Dancing, comedy and a keen understanding of populist cinema are his strengths.\"\nVijay's stardom, however, has never been accidental, said Pritham K Chakravarthy, film academic and critic. \"The seed was planted by his father who had Communist leanings and was keen on joining politics.\"\nVijay began as a child actor in the 1980s and was launched as a lead actor in 1992 by his parents - filmmaker SA Chandrasekhar and singer-writer Shoba Chandrasekhar - with Naalaiya Theerpu. The film flopped, but his career did not.\nOver the next three decades, he appeared in nearly 70 films, charting a carefully calibrated rise - from playing the romantic hero in his films in the late 1990s to acting as an angry young man in the 2000s to a carefully-honed image as saviour and vigilante in films after 2012.\nThough Vijay's early roles often leaned into hyper-masculine tropes, he later \"consciously course-corrected his image\", points out Shrikrishna. He later started projecting a saviour figure rooted in social justice in his movies. He spoke of farmers' distress in Kaththi, healthcare corruption in Mersal, supporting women's sports in Bigil and electoral manipulation in Sarkar.\n\"Now it's a different Vijay. His on-screen persona as incorruptible, restrained, morally upright, mirrored the ethical imagination of Dravidian politics, a cinematic grammar Tamil audiences recognise instinctively,\" says Chakravarthy.\nLong before Vijay launched his party, his cinema had thus already done the ideological groundwork. Audio launches doubled as soft political addresses. Fan clubs quietly transformed into grassroots networks.\nThe fandom is intense and ritualistic, with celebratory first-day screenings, midnight and 04:00 shows, milk offerings on towering cut-outs, garlands, drums, and whistles.\n\"Vijay remains capable of turning a movie release into a mass civic event. He is perhaps the last of the mega stars of this scale,\" Shrikrishna said.\nNot surprisingly, Jana Nayagan leans unapologetically into that mythology.\nWith CGI-enhanced action, thunderous fight sequences and dialogue like, \"I enter politics not to plunder, but to serve\", the film blurs fiction and intent.\nIt echoes Vijay's rally speeches where he has attacked the ruling DMK, mocking Chief Minister MK Stalin as \"uncle\", while also positioning himself firmly against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\"Many of the youth, who are vocally tired of over 50 years of Dravidian parties ruling the state, pin their hopes on Vijay as he poses as an alternative,\" said Chakravarthy.\nTamil Nadu goes to the polls in April and May, with Gen Z voters expected to make up nearly one-fifth of the electorate.\nPolitical analyst Sumanth C Raman said Vijay has a considerable following among Gen Z, many of whom are disillusioned with Tamil Nadu's long-ruling Dravidian parties, rooted in regional identity and social justice politics. \"His rallies draw massive crowds, but whether that movie glamour translates into loyal votes remains to be seen.\"\nA deadly crowd crush at a TVK rally in Karur in September 2025 killed 40 people, raising sharp criticism of his party's organisational readiness and Vijay's leadership.\nThe crowd surge forced him to halt his speech, and he faced backlash for not visiting victims immediately - though he later called the tragedy \"shattering\" and announced financial aid. \"Fleeing the scene in a crisis is a red flag,\" cautioned Chakravarthy. A month later, Vijay met victims' families and promised support.\nSo far, Vijay's platform rests on broad themes - anti-corruption, social justice, Tamil pride and resistance to what he calls authoritarianism by the federal government.\nRaman described it as broad but shallow. \"Beyond sweeping statements and positioning himself as a future chief minister of the state, he has not shared a credible programme or sharp manifesto.\"\nThe ruling DMK in the state has so far dismissed his political ambitions.\nDMK spokesperson Manuraj Shunmugasundaram said that as far as movie stars aspiring to led the state are concerned: \"Tamil Nadu has seen many Vijays.\"\nHe added that \"Vijay's party is untested electorally\" and it lacked clear policies on state or national socio-economic issues.\nSome analysts also noted that the party lacked a credible second-tier leadership and unresolved alliance questions.\nTVK says the BJP is its ideological opposite, and calls the DMK its political enemy. It has hinted at closeness to the Congress party - though whether this consolidates votes or splits the opposition is unclear.\n\"Vijay could upset some electoral carts if he chooses to align with the state's main opposition AIADMK party to take on the ruling DMK. Whether he will play his cards well is to be seen,\" says Raman.\nThe actor casts himself as a moral corrective on screen and in politics, drawing an emotional, almost devotional loyalty rather than debate. When Jana Nayagan reaches theatres, audiences will cheer and whistle - and mark the end of an era.\nBut it's not clear if his box-office dominance can survive Tamil Nadu's unforgiving electoral terrain.", "source": "global_news_BBC_world", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k5kxk3plo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "2026-01-13T00:51:34", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T08:03:32.121876", "language": "en", "tags": ["international", "current_events", "global", "politics", "news", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "BBC News", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 18, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 110, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 2, "reading_time_minutes": 0.09, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 110, "fetched_content_length": 7272, "content_improvement_ratio": 66.11}, "content_hash": "09b178ae8a578a01b4e9a9e04252e3ee", "_belonging_signals": ["rooted"], "_signal_count": 1}

Recent passkey deployments address this limitation by enabling multi-device credentials synchronized via platform-specific cloud ecosystems. However, these approaches require users and organizations to trust the corresponding cloud or phone providers with the protection and availability of their authentication material. In parallel, qualified electronic signature (QES) tokens and smart-card--based PKCS#11 modules provide high-assurance, hardware-rooted identity, yet they are not directly compatible with WebAuthn flows. This paper explores architectural options for bridging these technologies by securing a virtual FIDO2 authenticator with a QES-grade PKCS#11 key and enabling encrypted cloud synchronization of FIDO2 private keys. We first present and implement a baseline architecture in which the cloud stores only ciphertext and the decryption capability remains anchored exclusively in the user's hardware token. We then propose a hardened variant that introduces an Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)-based mechanism bound to a local user-verification factor, thereby mitigating cross-protocol misuse and ensuring that synchronization keys cannot be repurposed outside the intended FIDO2 semantics; this enhanced design is analyzed but not implemented. Both architectures preserve a pure WebAuthn/FIDO2 interface to relying parties while offering different trust and deployment trade-offs. We provide the system model, threat analysis, implementation of the baseline architecture, and experimental evaluation, followed by a discussion of the hardened variant's security implications for high-assurance authentication deployments.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06554", "published_date": "2026-01-13T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T08:04:26.317013", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "preprints", "computer-science", "cs.CR", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 240, "author": "Kemal Bicakci, Fatih Mehmet Varli, Muhammet Emir Korkmaz, Yusuf Uzunay", "raw_content_length": 1897, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.2, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "be3cf72240e3ac6b36826afe7bd0788a", "_belonging_signals": ["rooted"], "_signal_count": 1}

The idea of redundant assignment is to assign a data vector to more than one IVF lists for reducing the chance of missing true neighbors in IVF search. However, the naive strategy, which selects the second IVF list based on the distance between a data vector and the list centroids, performs poorly. Previous work focuses only on the inner product distance, while there is no optimized list selection study for the most popular Euclidean space. Moreover, the IVF search may access the same vector in more than one lists, resulting in redundant distance computation and decreasing query throughput. In this paper, we present RAIRS to address the above two challenges. For the challenge of the list selection, we propose an optimized AIR metric for the Euclidean space. AIR takes not only distances but also directions into consideration in order to support queries that are closer to the data vector but father away from the first chosen list's centroid. For the challenge of redundant distance computation, we propose SEIL, an optimized list layout that exploits shared cells to reduce repeated distance computations for IVF search. Our experimental results using representative real-world data sets show that RAIRS out-performs existing redundant assignment solutions and achieves up to 1.33x improvement over the best-performing IVF method, IVF-PQ Fast Scan with refinement.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07183", "published_date": "2026-01-13T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T08:04:26.511549", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "cs.IR", "computer-science", "preprints", "cs.DB", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 238, "author": "Zehai Yang, Shimin Chen", "raw_content_length": 1533, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.19, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "019acc6e992a7fc8483789668ebf67d4", "_belonging_signals": ["neighborly"], "_signal_count": 1}

The work presents a theoretical framework rooted in Chemical Organization Theory (COT) to characterize how stable, self-sustaining structures arise from the interactions of basic components. Key theoretical contributions include the formalization of atom sets as fundamental reactive units and the concept of synergy to describe the emergence of new reactions and species from the interaction of these units. The property of separability is defined to distinguish dynamically coupled systems from those that can be decomposed. This framework is then applied to the STARLIB nuclear reaction network database, analyzing how network structure, particularly the formation and properties of atom sets and semi-self-maintaining sets, changes as a function of temperature. Results indicate that increasing temperature generally enhances network cohesion, leading to fewer, larger atom sets. Critical temperatures are identified where significant structural reorganizations occur, such as the merging of distinct clusters of atom sets and the disappearance of small, isolated reactive units. The analysis reveals core clusters - large (containing more that 1000 reactions), semi-self-maintaining structures that appear to form the core of all potentially stable nucleosynthetic configurations at various temperatures.

They are rooted in the Boolean setting and are successful for, e.g., first-order theories such as linear rational arithmetic. What about their applicability in the quantitative setting where formulae evaluate to numbers and quantitative supremum/infimum quantifiers are the natural counterparts of Boolean quantifiers? Applications include establishing quantitative properties of programs, such as bounds on expected outcomes of probabilistic programs featuring nondeterminism, and analyzing the flow of information through programs. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first QE algorithm for possibly unbounded, $\\infty$- or $-\\infty$-valued, or discontinuous piecewise linear quantities. They are the quantitative counterpart to linear rational arithmetic, and they are a popular quantitative assertion language for probabilistic program verification. We provide rigorous soundness proofs as well as upper space complexity bounds. Moreover, we present two applications of our QE algorithm. First, our algorithm yields a quantitative CI theorem: given arbitrary piecewise linear quantities $f$ and $g$ with $f \\models g$, both the strongest and the weakest Craig interpolant of $f$ and $g$ are quantifier-free and effectively constructible.

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences.

Host Sudhir Nehru (44) agrees. Named after their daughter, Kudrat is a labour of love by him and his wife, Bhawana Koundal. It enjoys a beautiful prequel journey ‚Äî which has become Sudhir‚Äôs favourite story to tell.¬†¬†¬† Kudrat is located in the Tirthan Valley of Himachal Pradesh and is a favourite among travellers for the solitude it provides To hear it, you‚Äôll have to visit the adjacent forest, where he enjoys his evenings in a small clearing of the land. It‚Äôs paradoxically quiet here. Even in the silence, there is a cacophony ‚Äî the river and the birds never stop chatting. Kudrat is a utopian vision come true; one that Sudhir says involved three years and a lot of ‚Äúgut feelings‚Äù.¬†¬†¬†¬† And here‚Äôs where he begins his tale.¬†¬†¬† Kudrat is a boutique homestay in Himachal Pradesh and surrounded by deodar forests with a view of the Tirthan River ‚ÄòI wanted to live in the mountains‚Äô There should be a signboard somewhere urging guests to look right and left while at Kudrat. If they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll miss the red fox, flying squirrel, mountain goat, and leopard, who are regulars here.¬† ‚ÄúAs a Kashmiri born in Nagaland, I loved the mountains. But engineering took me to the city,‚Äù Sudhir begins. The corporate hustle shoehorned him into a vicious cycle of work, rigidly structured weekends, and a silent hope that Mondays would take a rain check.¬† The Wood House was built using sustainable kath kuni architectural practices But, every story has a plot twist. Sudhir and Bhawana‚Äôs was in 2012 when they were bitten by the backpacking bug. ‚ÄúWe set out with two bags, travelled across India and Europe for months at a stretch, only returning to our home in Delhi a couple of times in between,‚Äù Sudhir says. These two years coaxed the mavericks into revisiting their mountain dream.¬† Kudrat has two cottages, one made with wood and the other with stone to exemplify sustainable architectural practices And in 2014, when they stumbled upon this piece of land, they fell in love with it. The deodar forests seemed infinite, inviting them to bound into their open arms. And the couple did, purchasing land from a Himachali local (who is now an integral part of the Kudrat staff). At the time they presumed it would make for ‚Äúa good holiday home‚Äù. But, the birth of their baby girl segued this idea into a full-time homestay concept. They named her and the home Kudrat (which translates to ‚Äònature‚Äô in English), and knew the two needed Mother Nature to thrive.¬†¬†¬†¬† A love story spun between wood and stone How do you plan to spend your time at Kudrat? You can trek through the villages ‚Äî Gushaini marks the starting point for a hike into the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP), a UNESCO World Heritage Site; visit the Chhoie Waterfall or have lunch with the locals. But if calm is what you‚Äôre heading here for, the cedar trees, the birdsong, and the Tirthan River will be more than happy to oblige. They are excellent gatekeepers, barricading the raucous of the city, allowing only nature‚Äôs rhythm to filter to you.¬†¬†¬† There are numerous activities to enjoy at Kudrat which include treks and walks in the neighbourhood villages Sudhir credits a deep respect for the land for his eco-conscious building ideas. ‚ÄúSustainability per se was not on our minds. We knew we wanted to build using lakdi pathar (sticks and stones); we were keen on a village house,‚Äù he adds that at the time, this proved a challenge. ‚ÄúBack then, there wasn‚Äôt a road here, we had plenty of electricity issues.‚Äù¬† At Kudrat, every window opens up into the mountains, with the noise of the river and birdsong providing the perfect accompaniment But gazing at the completed Wood House ‚Äî built in the traditional kath kuni (traditional building style native to the Kullu region of Himachal Pradesh) style and cocooned by more than 100 deodar trees ‚Äî validated their efforts. The cottage is the perfect sanctuary for a literary hermit, its library corner and open outdoor fireplace lend it a cosy aesthetic. Each room overlooks the mountains, while the Braag Suite (named after the leopards), is a two-story room with an attic. The Stone House includes a glass roof which fills the interiors with natural light making for a beautiful experience The Wood House‚Äôs twin, the Stone House, is slightly more modern with a load-bearing RCC structure, architectured with mud plaster and rocks. Bhawana explains that the homes are adept at dealing with weather changes. ‚ÄúWood House is an ideal house for all weathers. The Stone House was made keeping the guest experience in mind. The glass skylight ensures it‚Äôs bright and lit up with natural light the entire day. The wood, stone walls, stone roof, and mud plaster help the homes stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter.‚Äù¬† Feast on the traditional dham¬†¬† Bhawana is thrilled to have traded the cubicle-bound life for her new office of green. In the¬† Tirthan Valley, the only deadlines are those of catching sunrises and sunsets. ‚ÄúCorporate life used to be 10 hours of work. Now life has become beautiful, and slow. I have a lot of time on hand. The entire journey has taught Sudhir and me patience.‚Äù¬† The food served at Kudrat is a blend of traditional Himachal dishes and of course the quintessential dham The relationship with nature has to be reciprocal, she insists. Ever since they set foot on the land, the couple has been regurgitating traditional concepts, whether through architecture or food. The dham (a traditional feast served in Himachal Pradesh) is an example. The Kullvi dham includes siddu (steamed wheat flour bun stuffed with lentil filling) with ghee and chutney, sepu vadi (steamed and deep-fried lentil dumplings), rajma (curry made with kidney beans), kadi (thick, tangy gravy made with yoghurt, gram flour, and spices), madhra (curd-based legume curry), khatta (a sour gravy made with dried green mangoes), local saag (dish cooked with leafy greens and spices), telua moong dal (a dish made with green gram and spices) local pickle: lingad (fiddlehead fern) or apple, dry fruit chutney, rice or chapati (Indian flatbread), and chilldo (pancake made of chestnut or jaggery rice).¬†¬† The ingredients for the food prepared at Kudrat is grown on the land and sourced from the local farms The ingredients for these are grown in the local farms. Some other classics at Kudrat include homemade jams, poori aloo (crispy deep-fried bread served with spiced potato curry), chola bhatura (chickpea gravy eaten with Indian flatbread), and stuffed parathas (Indian flatbread).¬†¬† The cottages at Kudrat exemplify how sustainability can be blended with luxury Sustainability is key, not just in the food but also in the practices on the land. A pond harvests 40,000 litres of rainwater, which the couple channels into the homestay‚Äôs daily water needs. Waste is segregated consciously. ‚ÄúWet waste is directed to the livestock, while we send dry waste to a plant in Manali, which recycles it,‚Äù Sudhir explains. Refillable toiletries and no plastic are some other norms. A beautiful promise to nature, indeed.¬† Sudhir is almost at the end of his tale. Fascinating, isn‚Äôt it? Now, it‚Äôs time for you to leave the clearing of land, proceed to Kudrat, and experience every detail in the flesh.

Makar Sankranti is drawing near, and with it comes the sight that marks this city each January. Rooftops bloom with colourful kites, and the sky fills with drifting tails of cotton and nylon. Children run across terraces, their laughter merging with the whoosh of strings slicing through the crisp air. The city feels alive, vibrant, and full of promise. However, beneath this celebration, a hidden danger weaves its way through the streets. Thin kite strings called ‘manjha’ shimmer in the sunlight, and many carry glass or synthetic coatings sharp enough to cut skin. Bikers navigate the roads with care, but one stray string can turn the joy of the festival into an accident in an instant. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Surat City Traffic Police (@suratcitytrafficpolice) A street-level response to a real problem Surat Traffic Police step into this scene, moving among the riders, not with whistles or fines, but with protective neck collars in hand. They approach with calm authority, offering the collars and a friendly word. A young delivery rider slows his scooter, expecting a reprimand, and instead receives a collar and a gentle warning. An elderly man pauses, curious, then accepts the collar with a nod. Each interaction carries warmth, turning what could be a brief stop into a moment of connection. Safety that fits into daily life The initiative spreads through the city streets like a wave. Riders wear the collars as they weave past traffic, the kites above them dancing against the winter sky. The collars are not just shields against danger; they are symbols of care, reminders that joy and safety can coexist. Every year, kite strings pose a threat, cutting across roads and occasionally injuring those below. The police campaign addresses this risk directly, showing that easy measures can prevent harm while preserving the spirit of the festival.

Three people, including a woman tourist, died due to suffocation caused by LPG leakage in Ghanche and Skardu. According to police, a couple died of suffocation inside a room due to leakage of LPG in Khawla Brah area of Ghanche district. The couple had been married only three months ago and were residing together at their home. The couple went to sleep on Sunday night in a room where an LPG heater was operational. Later, family members found them lying unconscious inside the room. They were immediately shifted to DHQ Hospital, Khaplu, where they were declared dead on Monday. In another incident, a woman tourist was found dead while her husband was injured due to LPG suffocation in their hotel room in Skardu on Sunday. Police said the tourist couple from Punjab’s Talagang area were sleeping in a local hotel room in Skardu. They added that both of them were found unconscious on Sunday and shifted to hospital, where the woman was declared dead. The police suspected that leakage of LPG in the room caused her death, while the condition of her husband is stable. The body was dispatched to their native village, while police have kicked off an investigation into the matter. ‘20-hour power outages’ People across the region are facing severe difficulties due to harsh weather, with most of them remaining indoors. Locals said the region faced over 20 hours of power outages during winter, along with shortages of firewood and gas. Authorities said that in upper areas of Baltistan — Astore, Hu­­nza, Nagar, and Ghizer — the mercury plunged to minus 16 degrees Celsius on Sunday night, bringing life to a standstill. Ahmed Khan, a local resident of Astore, told Dawn that residents had been experiencing harsh weather conditions since this week. Frozen water has made roads slippery, while unavailability and high prices of firewood and electricity shortages have added to the misery of people. Zulfiqar Ali from Skardu said tourism, the main source of income for locals, had declined completely, leaving people jobless. Other activities, including agriculture and local commerce, have also been suspended. Rahim Karim from Gojal said the area experienced less snowfall this year; however, temperatures plunged to minus 14 degrees Celsius. People in the area depend on tourism, which is seasonal, and for half of the year many remain jobless. PMD refutes claims The Pakistan Mete­orological Department (PMD) certain social media platforms were circulating misleading and unverified forecasts claiming an extreme cold wave across Pakistan from Jan 16 to 25, with record-breaking temperatures. The PMD refuted these claims, clarifying that no such extreme or historic cold wave was expected during this period. It advised the public and stakeholders to rely solely on official forecasts, warnings, and advisories issued by the PMD and to avoid spreading unverified information that might cause unnecessary concern.

{"id": "south_asian_dawn_67c5772c6f0f", "title": "Bangladesh standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup", "content": "WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece. Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka. Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern. While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches. There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament. The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics. This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it. The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”. “The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week. Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on. “Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole. Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”. Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body. “Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.” PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture. The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle. With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter. Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India. Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB. “Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.” The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft. Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. “PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said. By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.

He died pretty quickly from his injuries,\" said Corsican prosecutor Nicolas Septe.\n\"We'd just finished burying Alain's mother - it was a moment of pain and grief,\" said Father Roger-Dominique Polge who had led the funeral service.\n\"Suddenly we hear a gunshot and Alain falls down dead. In the middle of a cemetery, after a religious ceremony, I ask where are we, what kind of home are we living in? It's as if Corsica is worse than Sicily - it's unimaginable.\"\nNo motive is yet known but Orsoni was for decades a high-profile figure in Corsican society and his graveyard murder in his native village shines a light on the criminal clans that have blighted the island.\nThe investigation into his murder is being handled by a newly created national anti-organised crime prosecutor alongside the Marseille-based specialised regional crime office.\nA police source told Le Monde newspaper there were similarities with recent gangland killings targeting people linked to Orsoni's son, Guy.\nIn 2023, two of Guy Orsoni's associates were shot dead, both by a gunman firing from some distance away. Guy Orsoni is himself serving a 13-year jail term for the attempted murder of a member of the so-called Petit Bar gang in 2018.\nAlain Orsoni led a storied life in Corsica and abroad.\nRenowned for his good looks and rich singing voice, he became attracted to Corsican nationalism in the 1970s and took part in a gun attack in front of the Iranian embassy in 1980. Three years later his brother was kidnapped and presumed murdered.\n\"Father, brother and son all found themselves thrust over time into the heart of politics and criminal cases,\" criminologist Alain Bauer told Ouest-France newspaper.\nAlain Orsoni later founded the separatist Movement for Self-Determination (MPA), which won four seats in elections in 1992. He was unable to take up his seat because of campaign irregularities and later spent time in jail for a series of offences.\nAmid violent splits among Corsican nationalist leaders, he left the island for Central America in 1996, eventually returning to become president of football club AC Ajaccio in 2008.\nWeeks after his return, police thwarted a plot to kill him by the Petit Bar gang.\nHis role at AC Ajaccio ended in 2015 but he returned as club president in 2022, before returning to exile in Nicaragua and then resigning from his post in September last year.\nHe was long aware of the risk to his life and, after the killing of four of his associates over a two-year period, he told Le Figaro newspaper in 2012 that he had bought an armoured car under pressure from his family after he was targeted in 2008.\n\"I'm not afraid of dying. I don't wake up every morning thinking I'm going to be killed. I live a normal life, without a squad of bodyguards,\" he said.\n\"I'm portrayed as a godfather, even though I don't even own a business on Corsica. As former head of a nationalist movement for 15 years I wasn't exactly a saint. But to depict me as a dangerous wheeler-dealer?

Autonom fahrende Shuttles und Busse könnten den öffentlichen Nahverkehr (ÖPNV) in Deutschland angenehmer und effektiver machen. Das geht aus einer Studie im Auftrag von DB Regio hervor, der Regionalverkehrssparte der Deutschen Bahn. Laut den Szenarien für das Jahr 2045 könnten sich die Wartezeiten für Fahrgäste mancherorts halbieren, Straßen würden entlastet und ländliche Gebiete besser angebunden, wenn autonome Fahrzeuge flächendeckend eingesetzt werden.\nDen größten Nutzen entfaltet die Technologie demnach nicht, wenn nur bestehende Buslinien automatisiert oder privatwirtschaftliche Robotaxis eingesetzt werden. Letzteres würde das Verkehrsaufkommen in Metropolen demzufolge sogar um bis zu 40 Prozent erhöhen.\n170 Euro pro Monat sparen\n»Die Technologie und die Gesetze für die Anwendung im ÖPNV sind da«, sagte Frederik Ley, Vorstand Straße bei der Bahn-Tochter DB Regio. »Den größten Nutzen können wir daraus ziehen, wenn wir den ÖPNV grundlegend weiterentwickeln und das Angebot ausbauen – mit autonomen Shuttles, optimierten Buslinien und einer Verknüpfung zum Zug.«\nFür dieses erfolgversprechende Szenario wären rund eine Million autonomer Shuttles und Busse nötig. Die durchschnittliche Wartezeit sänke dann in Metropolen auf fünf Minuten und im ländlichen Raum auf 13 Minuten, was dort halb so viel wäre wie bisher. Der Anteil des ÖPNV an der gesamten Verkehrsleistung würde sich auf 35 Prozent mehr als verdoppeln. Die Belastung durch den Straßenverkehr in Städten könnte um bis zu elf Prozent zurückgehen.\nWas ebenfalls reizvoll klingt: Die öffentlichen Zuschüsse zum ÖPNV könnten trotz des ausgebauten Angebots um 20 Prozent sinken. Das wäre möglich, wenn die Technik besser wird und Nutzer mehr zahlen. Autofahrende würden 2045 beim Umstieg auf den ÖPNV dennoch durchschnittlich 170 Euro pro Monat sparen, heißt es laut der Studie. Sie würden im Monat selbst dann mehr Geld für ihr Auto ausgeben, als sie für Bus und Bahn zahlen müssten, wenn die Tickets teurer wären als heute.\nErstellt wurde die Studie in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Software- und Verkehrsplanungs-Unternehmen ioki, dem Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT), dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) und der Prognos AG.\n»Autonomes Fahren ist mehr als Technik – es ist eine Chance, Mobilität effizient und wirtschaftlich nachhaltig zu gestalten«, erklärte Meike Jipp, Bereichsvorständin für Energie und Verkehr beim DLR. Mobilität sei allerdings nicht rational, sondern tief verwurzelt in Routinen und Emotionen. Menschen verändern ihre Gewohnheiten nur, wenn das neue Angebot verlässlich und attraktiv sei sowie in ihr Alltagsleben passe, sagte Jipp.\nSie ist überzeugt: Solch ein flächendeckendes System würde nicht nur den Fahrgästen, sondern auch der deutschen Wirtschaft helfen, weil so ein neuer Markt für selbstfahrende Fahrzeuge in Europa geschaffen wird.", "source": "global_news_spiegel", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.spiegel.de/auto/fahrkultur/bahn-skizziert-szenario-fuer-idealen-nahverkehr-der-zukunft-a-273f4a72-a24a-4f94-a167-1985a0162e55#ref=rss", "published_date": "2026-01-13T14:38:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T16:04:45.377327", "language": "en", "tags": ["mainstream", "germany", "Mobilität", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "DER SPIEGEL - Schlagzeilen", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 30, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 186, "priority": 5, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.15, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 186, "fetched_content_length": 2939, "content_improvement_ratio": 15.8}, "content_hash": "939ce83bc26bf71ce121cdadb5874887", "_belonging_signals": ["rooted"], "_signal_count": 1}

{"id": "science_biorxiv_c4dcd3714fba", "title": "Identifying Evolutionary Relatedness Effects on Diversification from Phylogenies using Neural Networks", "content": "Reconstructing the forces that shaped macroevolutionary histories from extant phylogenies is fundamentally challenging: richly parameterized diversification models are often only weakly identifiable; different evolutionary mechanisms can yield nearly indistinguishable tree shapes. Here we use a model with evolutionary relatedness dependence to evaluate how much information about such forces can be recovered from simulated trees. We train graph neural networks and long short-term memory classifiers to distinguish three scenarios of feedback of diversity on diversification: effect of phylogenetic diversity (total branch length), evolutionary distinctiveness (average phylogenetic distance of a species to all other species in a clade), and nearest-neighbor distance (phylogenetic distance to the mostly closely related species). We also train a suite of regression networks to estimate the underlying diversification parameters. We then analyze classification performance, calibration of predicted class probabilities, regression errors, and their dependence on tree size and on the strength and sign of richness and relatedness effects. Across network architectures and complexity levels, scenario classification is only moderately accurate and strongly asymmetric as revealed by the confusion matrix. Trees generated under an effect of nearest-neighbor distance on diversification tend to be correctly classified, whereas those with an effect of evolutionary distinctiveness are frequently misclassified. Regression networks systematically shrink predictions toward the empirical mean, especially for complex models, suggesting broad regions of parameter space with low identifiability. Strong global dependence of diversification rates on diversity further erodes recoverability by driving large variations in tree size that mask the subtler signatures of relatedness effects. In contrast, sufficiently strong speciation-relatedness effects can carve out narrow regions of parameter space in which scenarios and parameters become practically recoverable. Together, our results provide a map of when neural networks can and cannot infer diversification mechanisms from extant trees under our evolutionary relatedness dependence model, and they underscore the need for additional data or constraints when using flexible diversification models for macroevolutionary inference.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.12.699140v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2026-01-13T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T16:05:00.879353", "language": "en", "tags": ["cutting-edge", "life-sciences", "preprints", "biology", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 310, "author": "Qin, T., van Benthem, K.

Sox8 and Sox9, members of the SoxE transcription factor family, are highly expressed in late-stage retinal progenitor cells and mature Muller glia, yet their functional roles remain incompletely defined. Here we employed gain- and loss-of-function approaches, single-cell multiomic profiling, and injury models to investigate Sox8/9 function. Overexpression of Sox8 and/or Sox9 in early-stage RPCs suppressed early-born cell fates and promoted photoreceptor generation, consistent with a role in late-stage temporal identity. Conversely, conditional deletion of Sox8 and/or Sox9 in late-stage progenitors did not impair Muller glia specification but caused radial displacement of Muller glia nuclei into the outer retina and modest changes in glial gene expression. Loss of Sox8/9 in mature Muller glia modestly increased proliferation post-injury without inducing neurogenic competence. These findings suggest that Sox8/9 are dispensable for gliogenesis and repression of neurogenic competence but are essential for proper laminar positioning and maturation of retinal Muller glia.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.12.698638v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2026-01-13T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T16:05:00.880640", "language": "en", "tags": ["cutting-edge", "life-sciences", "preprints", "biology", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 167, "author": "Pannullo, N., Datta, D., Santiago, C., Tangeman, J., Jiang, L., Duncan, L., Blackshaw, S.", "raw_content_length": 1235, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.835, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "80cde7ba66acffe6222c70ab60e9cd60", "_belonging_signals": ["generational"], "_signal_count": 1}
{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c5c1746b8c5d", "title": "Animatiefilm KPop Demon Hunters gaat Frozen achterna: 'Heel slim bedacht'", "content": "Met de winst van twee Golden Globes eergisteren, twee vrijwel zekere Oscarnominaties (animatie en liedjes) en ruim 500 miljoen streams op Netflix blijft de animatiefilm KPop Demon Hunters in het middelpunt van de belangstelling staan. \"Het doet een beetje denken aan het succes van Frozen\". Al twee maanden nadat de animatiefilm vorig jaar juni was uitgekomen op Netflix, was het de meest bekeken film ooit op het streamingplatform. Het invloedrijke Time Magazine noemde het de doorbraak van het jaar 2025. De animatiefilm volgt het fictieve Zuid-Koreaanse/Amerikaanse zangtrio Huntrix dat in het geheim demonen bestrijdt, terwijl leadzangeres Rumi met haar innerlijke demonen strijdt. De film bevat liedjes die zijn geschreven en worden gezongen door artiesten die actief zijn in de populaire Zuid-Koreaanse muziekstroming K-pop. Aanstekelijke liedjes \"Het is heel slim gemaakt\", zegt NPO 3FM-dj en kenner van de Aziatische cultuur Mai Verbij. \"Bij de jongere generatie was K-pop al enorm populair en in de film zitten nummers die enorm catchy zijn en choreografieën die kinderen kunnen nadansen\". Ze roemt ook het verhaal. \"Het volgt de K-pop-formule en mixt het met Pixar-achtige (makers van onder meer Toy Story en Finding Nemo, red.) elementen met superhelden en slechteriken.\" Time Magazine stelde dat het de eerste animatiefilm is sinds Frozen in 2013 \"die zo alom vertegenwoordigd is in onze levens\". De vergelijking komt niet uit de lucht vallen; ook Frozen had een vrouwelijke hoofdpersoon die een strijd voerde met zichzelf. Veel merchandise Ook de kleurrijke personages uit beide animatiefilms lenen zich goed voor allerlei merchandise: van speelgoed tot kleding. Verbij: \"Je zag tijdens Halloween dat veel mensen zich hadden verkleed als een van de personages uit de film.\" Netflix sloot voor het speelgoed gebaseerd op de film deals met Mattel en Hasbro. Maar dat de speelgoedmakers er niet van uitgingen dat de film zo'n succes zou worden, blijkt wel uit de overeenkomst met Netflix die ze pas in oktober sloten. Daardoor waren ze veel te laat om tijdens kerst te profiteren van het gigantische succes van de film. Koreaans karakter De film werd bedacht door de Canadees-Koreaanse filmmaker Maggie Kang. Zij wilde een tekenfilm maken die geworteld was in de Zuid-Koreaanse cultuur. In het verhaal komt onder meer een verwijzing voor naar Jeoseung Saja, een boodschapper die volgens Koreaanse vertellingen zielen naar de onderwereld begeleidt. Hoewel de film ook veel Noord-Amerikaanse invloeden bevat en grotendeels Engelstalig is, komt het Koreaanse karakter goed naar voren, vooral in de manier waarop K-pop wordt getoond, zegt Verbij. \"In de K-pop wil je als groep het populairst zijn met het best bedachte concept. Dus je ziet dat de ene groep als thema meer een schattige uitstraling heeft, terwijl andere groepen wat stoerder zijn of juist wat sexyer. Die verschillen zie je ook in de film terug.\" Wel zegt ze dat de film geen compleet beeld geeft van de K-pop. \"Als je het kritisch bekijkt, mis je de wurgcontracten en schandalen van de K-pop, maar over het algemeen is de esthetiek er heel erg sterk in verwerkt en is het heel herkenbaar.\" Hoog in de hitlijsten Het succesvolste uit de film zijn toch wel de aanstekelijke liedjes. Waar Let It Go uit Frozen in 2014 onder meer een Oscar won en hoog in de hitlijsten stond, lijkt Golden uit KPop Demon Hunters dat succes voorbij te streven. Dat nummer, dat in de film wordt gezongen door Huntrix, staat na zes maanden wereldwijd nog altijd in de top 10 van meest gestreamde nummers. Ook staat het nummer al 23 weken in de Nederlandse Top 40, waarvan 19 weken op een top 10-positie. Daarnaast won het al een Golden Globe voor beste originele lied in een film en is het genomineerd voor twee Grammy Awards. Het nummer is op YouTube al meer dan een miljard keer bekeken: Ook op de radio wordt het nummer veelvuldig gedraaid. Dat is een groot verschil met een aantal jaar geleden, zegt radio-dj Verbij. \"Je ziet eigenlijk al jaren dat K-popnummers veel worden gestreamd op Spotify en worden bekeken op YouTube, maar dat radiostations het niet draaiden. Dat is vorig jaar echt onwijs gekanteld.\" Als voorbeeld noemt ze het nummer APT van Rosé en Bruno Mars dat veel voorbijkomt en nummers van Blackpink, de K-popgroep waar Rosé in zit. Ook KPop Demon Hunters heeft volgens haar aan die populariteit bijgedragen. \"Het is nu echt mainstream geworden.\" Ook het nummer Soda Pop uit de film werd een grote hit:", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2598011", "published_date": "2026-01-13T14:05:43", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T16:05:01.117080", "language": "en", "tags": ["nederland", "mainstream", "dutch_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "NOS Nieuws", "source_category": "dutch_news", "word_count": 732, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 5010, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 3.66, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "4680bac1ca3b7330e38f6c12316dc0bd", "_belonging_signals": ["rooted"], "_signal_count": 1}

We combined Current and Potential Land Productivity Indicators (CLPI/PLPI) to link desertification risk with food production capacity.Results and discussionThe obtained data reveals that 36.73% of the study area is characterized by high and very sensitive areas to desertification (Critical type of ESA), moderate sensitive areas about 23.39% (Fragile type), while the no sensitive/very low sensitive areas (Non-Affected type) occupies approximately 25.39% of the study area. For land productivity assessment results showed that for Current Land Productivity Index (CLPI) most of the study areas 43.73%; are poor classes (class IV) in terms of agricultural use, the 22.65% are extremely poor class or nil (class V) and 19.14% are average area (class III). Also, for Potential Land Productivity Index (PLPI) 10.44% of the study area are excellent area (class I), the 35.47% are good (class II), the 16.96% are average (III) and 22.65% are poor area (class IV). Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis identifies a substantial opportunity: about 45.9% of land defined as critically susceptible to desertification simultaneously exhibits good-to-excellent potential productivity (PLPI Classes I-II). This delineates high-priority areas where focused interventions may simultaneously reduce desertification and improve food production. The research directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on Land), by advancing approaches that mitigate land degradation and enhance agricultural resilience in arid regions.

Finger millet is an underutilized yet climate-resilient crop with valuable genetic variation that can be leveraged to enhance food security and improve nutritional quality.MethodsThis study examines varietal diversity, farmers’ preferred attributes, varietal distribution, production environments, and traditional conservation practices of finger millet germplasm across six agroecological regions (Mid-Northern, Northern, West Nile farmlands; Southern dryland and highlands, Western highlands, and Karamoja drylands) in Uganda. Data was collected between June 2020 and February 2021 through household surveys, key informant interviews, and field observations.ResultsMost agroecologies were highly to moderately suitable for finger millet production, and farmers utilized traditional knowledge to select and conserve millet germplasm for present and future purposes. Over 90% of the varieties collected were landraces exhibiting wide variability, providing desirable traits necessary for improving finger millet. A total of 460 landrace accessions were collected, and 198 distinct local names were documented across ethnic groups, depending on morphology, maturity, and cultural significance. Farmer selection and conservation of finger millet focused on taste (38.6%), drought tolerance (31.9%), pest and disease tolerance (14.1%), and early maturity (12.4%), confirming the role of preferential traits in addressing food and nutrition security. Conservation practices include sharing seeds with neighbors or relatives, replanting stored seeds, and selecting and storing seeds in designated areas, such as farm stores or rooftops. Over 72.1% of the seed was from farmer-saved sources, underscoring the important role of farmers in maintaining varietal diversity. Correlation analysis showed significant associations between soil characteristics, agroecology, seed sources, and farmer preference. PCA grouped varietal adoption drivers into environment factors, market/consumption attributes, and seed system/conservation practices. However, threats such as labor demands, drought, pests, diseases, aging farmers, and the replacement of millet with maize and rice pose a risk of genetic erosion.ConclusionThe abundance of landraces presents a rich genetic pool for breeding and conservation.

The case is focused on the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\nThe International Court of Justice at The Hague has opened a genocide case against Myanmar over the South Asian nation's treatment of Rohingya Muslims. The hearings are being watched closely by legal experts for clues on how the court might deal with future cases, such as the one against Israel over its actions in Gaza. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports.\nELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: The case against Myanmar was brought by the West African nation of Gambia. The Genocide Convention gives countries a mandate to act against genocide anywhere in the world, even if they're not affected. Gambia's Justice Minister Dawda Jallow told ICJ judges this was not about esoteric issues of international law.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nDAWDA JALLOW: It is about real people, real stories and real group of human beings, the Rohingya of Myanmar. They have been targeted for destruction.\nBEARDSLEY: In the fall of 2017, around 1 million Rohingya Muslims fled violence by the Myanmar army and Buddhist militias, escaping to neighboring Bangladesh and bringing harrowing accounts of mass rape, arson and murder. Human rights groups have called it a coordinated, scorched-earth campaign. Myanmar rejects the accusations and says it was waging a counterterrorism campaign against armed Rohingya groups. NPR reported extensively on the refugee crisis. Here's Michael Sullivan speaking to Rohingya mother Satara Bago, who fled with her 2-year-old.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)\nMICHAEL SULLIVAN: \"Wednesday, they burned our village, so we ran to another,\" she says. \"But the next day, they burned it, too. So we just kept going until we reached the river.\" But her husband and two of her children were killed, she says, along the way. Now it's just her and her daughter.\nBEARDSLEY: The International Court of Justice, which was established after World War II and is an arm of the U.N., is allowing a 2023 charge of genocide against Israel brought by South Africa to go ahead. The case is still in its early stages. Israel has rejected the charge. In its 80-year history, the closest the world court has come to holding a nation responsible for genocide was in 2007 in a case brought against Serbia by Bosnia for the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica. The court ruled it an act of genocide but did not hold Serbia responsible. While the ICJ has no power to enforce its decisions, they do carry moral weight with the international community. However, a few countries - including Israel, China and the U.S. - do not recognize the court.\nEleanor Beardsley, NPR News, Paris.\n(SOUNDBITE OF GIBRAN ALCOCER'S \"IDEA 1\")\nCopyright © 2026 NPR.

She would be over the moon to see all the lovely comments❤️ No sound as requested 🥺 #alzheimersawareness #fyp #grandparents #graduation #alzheimer Some people said they should have stuck with the version with music, because phew. \"Crying even HARDER now hearing her words clearly 😭 bless you both. 🤍\"\"I cried when I couldn't hear what she said and now I can't stop crying.. my mom had dementia and I know those moments she remember was the most precious moments so I understand how you feel. God bless 🥺\"\"I literally have no tears left in my body right now, my grandma has suffered from Alzheimer for almost 10 years now, so this video got me extremely emotional. I am so so happy for you. 🥹\"\"Me balling my eyes out because I also got those five minutes with my nana who passed of the same 🥹 God bless you guys. ❤️\"\"Stop it 🥺🥺🥺🥺 she's never ever forgotten how much she loves you ❤\" The love of a grandparent is a gift.Photo credit: CanvaPeople with experience caring for dementia patients shared their own stories, as well as insights into what was happening in Paige's video, making the moment all the more meaningful.\"Dementia worker here! That's 'cause this isn't just her short term memory. She's been dreaming about your future for a long time love. This is a moment she's been waiting to see. She'd never forget that.💗\"\"You know that's moment she always wanted to be there for. Her brain gave her a reprieve.\"\"It's because she has dreamt about this moment for SO LONG. Alzheimers affects short term memory. Shes seen you in that gown since you were a little girl. You fulfilled 2 people's dreams that day 🥺\"\"Mine did that on my wedding day. She walked over and said, 'When did you grow up and become a beautiful bride, Kandi?'\"\"I just remembered when my grandpa also broke through Alzheimer's for 5 mins and said I looked beautiful on my hs graduation. 😭\" Scientists are trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease.Photo credit: CanvaWhat's the latest in Alzheimer's research?According to the Alzheimer's Association, there are approximately 7.2 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease, which means many more millions of people are affected by it. The University of California reports that Alzheimer's affects 10 percent of people over age 65 and kills more people annually than breast and prostate cancer combined.However, after decades of research into treatment and prevention, researchers are beginning to see promising results that offer hope for the future.\"We've had thousands of failed clinical trials and made very little progress against this devastating disease for decades,\" said Martin Kampmann, professor of biochemistry and biophysics who studies the molecular aspects of dementia at UC San Francisco. \"But just over the last five or so years, we've hit an inflection point. We're starting to get traction.\"There are two FDA-approved drugs that target the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease and can delay cognitive impairment by up to seven months. But those drugs don't reverse or cure the disease, and significant side effects may give some families pause.However, the discovery of a compound that increases gamma oscillations, brain signals that regulate connectivity between different brain regions and affect cognitive processes like working memory, offers the potential not just for treatment but for the reversal of cognitive decline. In a 2024 study led by Istvan Mody, a professor of neurology and physiology at UCLA Health, the compound was given to mice with Alzheimer's disease. Prior to treatment, the mice couldn't remember how to navigate a maze. Afterward, they were nearly as good at getting through it as mice without Alzheimer's.\"We've shown that this works in mice,\" said Mody. \"If we can develop a therapy that's safe and effective for people, we may be able to restore cognitive function. That's the ultimate hope.\" — (@) Additionally, a 2025 study from Case Western University tested a pharmaceutical intervention in mice with advanced Alzheimer's. The research showed that the brain’s failure to maintain normal levels of NAD+, a central cellular energy molecule, is a major driver of Alzheimer's disease. The study used a pharmacological agent to maintain proper NAD+ balance, resulting in a recovery of cognitive function in the mice. It's another glimpse of hope, especially if those results carry over to human clinical trials.Many scientists are working on dementia-related diseases and making progress. In the meantime, families like Paige's will take whatever moments they can get with loved ones who have Alzheimer's.", "source": "positive_news_upworthy", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.upworthy.com/grandma-alzheimers-disappears-5-minutes-graduation", "published_date": "2026-01-13T02:08:45", "collected_date": "2026-01-13T20:02:47.323042", "language": "en", "tags": ["Dementia", "Grandparents", "viral_positive", "change", "Beautiful", "Grandkids", "impact", "Grandma", "Alzheimers", "social_good", "Love", "Tears", "Family", "Graduation", "Grandmother", "positive_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Upworthy", "source_category": "positive_news", "word_count": 948, "author": "Annie  Reneau", "raw_content_length": 10213, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 4.74, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "83e1f37303d09d592af02fd9239f3be3", "_belonging_signals": ["grandparent"], "_signal_count": 1}
{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_05a4840fe6ef", "title": "How a Punjab Village Cooked Without LPG for 10 Years", "content": "In a corner of Hoshiarpur district in Punjab, many households in Lambra Kangri village have discovered a renewable solution that not only fuels their kitchens but also cuts household energy bills and offers a practical way to manage cattle dung. For nearly a decade, 44 families here have stopped using costly LPG cylinders, relying instead on biogas produced from cattle dung. Since 2016, a community biogas plant set up by the Lambra Kangri Multipurpose Cooperative Society has processed up to 2,500 kg of cattle dung each day. It captures methane gas, which is piped directly into 44 homes for cooking and daily use. On average, households now spend just Rs 200 to Rs 300 per month on biogas, compared with over Rs 700 for a single LPG cylinder. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Better India (@thebetterindia) Inspired by South Korea, replicated in Punjab The idea was sparked when Lambra Kangri resident Jaswinder Singh Saini went on a study tour to South Korea and observed the country’s efficient waste-to-energy systems. He resolved to adapt the model back home. On returning, Saini was disturbed by how cattle dung in his village clogged drains and created waste management issues. He approached the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, and the Punjab Pollution Control Board for technical assistance. With a small government grant of Rs 2 lakh from the Union Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and major investment from the Lambra Kangri Multipurpose Cooperative Society, Saini helped set up the community biogas plant in 2016. Biomass turns organic waste into clean energy, cutting pollution, fuel costs and improving sanitation. Photograph: (Hindustan Times) The system works through a simple, community-led process. Cow dung is collected door to door and transported to the biogas plant, where it is converted into clean cooking gas. This gas is supplied to homes through a network of underground and overground pipelines, replacing expensive LPG cylinders. The biogas used by each household is digitally metered and billed, ensuring transparency and efficiency. What makes the model sustainable is that the leftover slurry from the plant is sold as nutrient-rich biofertiliser. This not only improves sanitation in the village but also generates income, making the system economically viable and easy to maintain. Why biogas matters Biogas is a clean and affordable alternative to LPG and firewood, especially in rural India where fuel costs and pollution are major concerns. It turns waste into energy, reduces methane emissions, and improves sanitation. What makes Lambra special is its strong spirit of community effort. By using local resources and working together, the village shows how biogas can help India move towards energy self-reliance in a simple and sustainable way. More biomass plants in India can be run by local bodies, creating jobs and using local resources.

I’m Kelly McEvers, and this is Atlas Obscura, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. So I don’t know about you, but I like to keep track of all the places that I have visited, say, in the past year. I have lists of all the countries that I visit in a given region. Each year I go back to my handwritten calendar planner book because, yes, I still write everything down. I have kept track of all my trips, and that helps me remember all the places I’ve visited and the people I saw. Most people I know are, of course, more advanced than this. They actually keep digital records like lists of restaurants where they want to go or Google Maps with pins on places. In case you have somehow stumbled upon this podcast and you don’t know too much about Atlas Obscura, we actually have a map, an Atlas, filled with thousands upon thousands of unusual places across the globe. Each place is submitted by a person, and it is a fun tool to use whether you are on vacation or you want to get to know your own hometown better. My guest today has visited over 1,000 of these places. Her name is Caroline Mazel-Carlton, and she has been working toward that goal for more than 10 years. This project, Visiting 1,000 places, was about more than just taking items off the list. She says it helped save her life. Caroline, welcome. This is an edited transcript of the Atlas Obscura Podcast: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. Find the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and all major podcast apps. This episode contains discussions of suicidal thoughts. If you or someone you know is struggling, contact the Suicide Crisis Hotline by calling or texting 988. Caroline Mazel-Carlton: Oh, I’m getting teary already. It’s so good to be here. Thank you, Kelly. Kelly McEvers: Yeah, welcome. So talk about your first ever visit to an Atlas Obscura place. Caroline Mazel-Carlton: Yeah. So one of the first times that I remember using the Atlas Obscura was when I wanted to take my now-husband on a romantic interlude, like a nice weekend away. And so I was looking for spots—bed and breakfasts—and the Atlas Obscura was so helpful because it showed me that not too far away in Fall River, Massachusetts, you can find Lizzie Borden’s house. Kelly: In case you’re not familiar, in 1892, Lizzie Borden allegedly murdered her parents, Abby and Andrew Borden, in their house with an axe. Lizzie was acquitted. And Caroline believes she was innocent. But the whole thing has become a bit of a folk story. And the house where the murders took place still stands now as this untraditional bed and breakfast. Caroline: They had this whole getaway that you could have and sleep in Lizzie Borden’s house. They had dummies set up, sort of positioned where, Andrew Borden, what he would have looked like after the crime had been committed. So it was this beautiful Victorian house full of wonderful Victorian hair art, which I’m a big fan of Victorian hair art as well—some great specimens of that there. So it was just an amazing experience. Kelly: And I would imagine that your now husband was into it? Caroline: Oh, yeah, yeah. It was sort of like a litmus test in a way. Kelly: I was going to say, if he passed that, then he knew he was a keeper. Caroline: There’s a beautiful picture of us taken where we were sitting on this like Victorian couch and we have the dummy representing Andrew Borden’s bloody corpse splayed out across our laps. And we’re just brimming with young love. And it’s such a beautiful photograph. Kelly: Yeah. I love it. You’re like, this is the one for me. Caroline: Absolutely. And I did try, when we got married, I tried to convince my mom to let me use that photo for our save the date. But she said, “No, I’m not into the idea of this bloody corpse photo.” So we ended up using a picture from another trip we took to Paris. Kelly: Nice. And I would love to just know where your urge to go places started. What was one of your most memorable trips you took as a kid? Caroline: So my family growing up, we weren’t the type of family that went to the same beach or the same lake house every year for vacation. One of my family mottos was, “We’ll go anywhere once.” Kelly: Oh, I love that. Caroline: And so my dad has always been a history buff, but he’s never shied away from the weirder and grittier parts of American history. Some of my early memories are definitely wandering around graveyards. I remember seeing the taxidermied horse of Stonewall Jackson in some weird museum in Virginia. One place we went, and sadly, you can’t go here anymore. My dad has sort of, like, a dark streak, like, dark humor. And he became obsessed with the story of this guy named Floyd Collins, who was a cave explorer that actually got trapped and died in the Mammoth Cave system. So my dad and I actually did some caving together and visited the museum that honors this man. A tribute to explorers everywhere, but sadly he did not make it out of the cave. Kelly: Mm-hmm. You actually set this goal of trying to visit 1,000 Atlas Obscura places over a decade ago in 2012. And for so many people, you know, travel and seeing the world, there’s all these reasons we do it, but a lot of it is like: I want a change in perspective, or I want to learn more about this culture. I want to be wowed. For you, it sounds like there was a really kind of specific reason that you did this. Can you take us back to that time and talk about what was going on in your life? Caroline: So for me, I grew up experiencing a lot of bullying over how I looked or the way that I acted. And I started to struggle a lot with thoughts of suicide. And in fact, for certain parts of my life I was hospitalized and was in treatment programs where you’re not allowed to leave places like that. So it’s kind of a smaller existence. For me, it was always trying to figure out, how do I survive? How do I find a way to exist in this world? And what I realized is, for a lot of us that grapple with suicidal thoughts, it’s not truly that we want to literally die, but that the life that we’re living needs to end. It’s sort of this desire to be transformed in a way. For me, trying to figure out how to exist in the world has always been a bit of a battle in and of itself. And I remember one time seeing a book on my uncle. My uncle Doug also loved to travel the world. And he had a book called 1,000 Places to See Before You Die. Kelly: Okay. Caroline: And I thought about that. And I thought about the power of saying to myself, you know what? You can’t die today because there’s still places that you haven’t seen yet. So I used that book for a while, but then when I discovered Atlas Obscura, I was like, these sites are actually more interesting to me. They’re more accessible. They’re weirder. As I visit Atlas Obscura sites, I often learn about weird people like myself. I’ve seen amazing outsider art. So reaching a thousand Atlas Obscura sites before I died became really, really important to me. Kelly: Since then, Caroline has visited Atlas Obscura places around the world, from the grave of Johnny Appleseed in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to a temple complex in Pune, India, with 500 statues of Lord Ganesh. Once, on a 16-hour layover in Hong Kong, she left the airport and took a tram over the mountains to see the world's largest-seated bronze Buddha. She’s been to the Icelandic Phallological Museum in Reykjavik and the world’s largest Czech egg in Wilson, Kansas, and a taxidermy shop in Paris that Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali would visit for inspiration. Taxidermy holds a special place in Caroline’s heart. Caroline: There’s one Atlas Obscura site I’m going to give a shout out to, Ole’s Big Game Steakhouse in Nebraska, where you can be surrounded by taxidermy and also you can eat at the same time. Kelly: Which, not going to lie, doesn’t sound great to some people, but I love it. Today, Caroline works in suicide prevention. with an organization that does peer support, advocacy, and training for harm reduction. And she brought her 1,000 places goal into that work. Caroline has led trainings around the world, and sometimes on these trips, she and her colleagues will visit Atlas Obscura sites together. Caroline says it is really hard to choose a favorite memory. Caroline: Oh, there are so many. I remember one time we were doing an alternatives to suicide training and we were in Tacoma, Washington, and we actually found on Atlas Obscura the grave of Kurt Cobain, who was someone that I looked up to when I was younger, one of my favorite musicians, and who did die by suicide. But we went there together and it felt like such a special place to be there and honor him and his role in our lives and the way he could give voice to pain in a way that other people could connect with. I also remember a time where I was giving a talk at The Hague in the Netherlands and we visited a museum. I think it’s called Museum of the Mind, which had been a psychiatric hospital. But then they filled it with art, beautiful art made from former psychiatric patients. So going there and to some of the Van Gogh sites. And it’s just been incredible to do that with some of my colleagues who’ve also struggled with thoughts of suicide. And I really look at this achievement of reaching a thousand sites as something that we did together. And it felt really special because it was all connected to the journey of healing and embracing our weirdness and our desire to live in a world that’s not always, you know, normative. Kelly: So, I mean, you hit the goal, right? You’re over 1,000. You’re at 1,048, to be exact. So what’s next? I mean, how do you, you know, where do you go from there? Do you set a new goal? Are you just going to keep on keeping on at this point? Do you feel like you’re going to travel differently now? Caroline: Yeah. Well, after meeting the goal, I was like, I can rest a little bit because I honestly thought I’m 43. So I thought I would be at least 50 before I hit 1,000. but I hit it much more quickly than I thought I would. But the thing about Atlas Obscura is there’s always more you can do. And one of the things that I really encourage everyone listening to do is to add sites to the Atlas yourself. It’s a thrill for me to do that. I remember one time I was working in Brazil and we were just in this little town that had no Atlas Obscura sites, but I’m like, I’m going to find something. And I found this guy with a little, he had a cell phone store, but then he had sort of in the back rooms, all these historical communication devices. Even one of the first Morse code devices and a phonograph. And we got to, through broken English and broken Portuguese, I wrote an article and posted that on the Atlas, and I checked it today, and now eight people have been there. When you add a site to the Atlas, you really do change people’s lives. You know, I don’t struggle as much in my life anymore as when I started because the world just seems more weird and welcoming. Kelly: Caroline Mazel-Carlton, thank you so much for sharing your story and thank you for the work that you do helping other people too. Caroline: Absolutely. I just seek to make this place more welcoming and, you know, people are struggling. My organization, we have alternatives to suicide support groups. There are places you can go to talk where people will listen and not shame you or judge you and where we acknowledge that there’s many paths to healing. And sometimes that path to healing means walking around a really weird taxidermy store and that’s okay. Kelly: While eating a steak. Caroline: Yes. I’m here for it. Kelly: That was Caroline Mazel-Carlton. She has visited 1,048 Atlas Obscura places. No doubt many more to come. We will put a link to the Atlas in our show notes, so maybe you can start ticking off your own list of 1,000 places.

It could be in crosshairs again as Trump weighs a fresh attack on Islamic Republic A US Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense launching station positioned in Israel, on 4 March 2019 (Cory Payne/AFP) Off The US and Qatar announced the opening of a new centre to coordinate air and missile defence at al-Udeid air base, as the Trump administration weighs intervening in Iran. Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of Central Command, or Centcom, said the new centre was a “significant step forward” in the US's coordination of air defence. According to a statement on Tuesday, 17 countries are active at the facility in Qatar. The US has for years been trying to deepen air defence cooperation among its regional partners with an eye towards Iran in a so-called \"Middle East Nato\". However, the US’s position as security guarantor for the region was undermined by Israel's September attack on Hamas negotiators in Doha, analysts and officials in the region say. Middle East Eye reported at the time that Trump was aware of the Israeli attack beforehand. Details of the operation are still murky, but The Wall Street Journal reported that Israel launched missiles at Doha with planes flying over the Red Sea. The Trump administration denied it had advanced warning of the attack, but Doha is home to al-Udeid, the US’s largest military base in the Middle East. The presence of the new air defence coordination cell underscores how Qatar is a linchpin in the US’s broader network of air defence systems and early warning technology. In response to the attack, Qatar sought further US security guarantees. Trump issued an executive order that equates an attack on the small, gas-rich Gulf state to be an attack on the US. Not to be outdone, Saudi Arabia sought its own US security pledge during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to Washington in November. The Trump administration is eyeing major arms deals with both countries, and MEE reported in December that it is reviewing Israel’s \"Qualitative Military Edge\" - a term that enshrines Israel's military superiority over its Arab and Muslim neighbours in American defence sales. Iran strikes looming The announcement of a new cell to coordinate air defence comes as the US weighs potential military strikes on Iran amid escalating, and deadly, protests there. Trump on Tuesday called on protestors to “take over” government institutions and said that “HELP IS ON ITS WAY” in a social media post. Qatar could be caught between both sides in an escalation. It is the only country in the region to have been attacked by both Israel and Iran. US asked Saudi Arabia to send missile interceptors to Israel during Iran conflict. Riyadh refused Read More » Iran launched strikes on al-Udeid in June in response to the US’s bombing of its nuclear sites. Officials and analysts saw the Iranian strikes as largely deescalatory, with the US being warned to evacuate the base. Doha and Tehran share the world’s largest natural gas field and have kept cordial relations. Qatar and Oman have served as mediators between the US and Iran. At one time, Israeli military personnel were deployed at al-Udeid. It is unclear whether they are still stationed at the base. Israel has faced backlash over its genocide in Gaza and attacks on Syria, Lebanon and Iran. Except for the UAE, efforts to deepen Israeli ties to Gulf states have stalled, particularly with Saudi Arabia. When Israel was under an Iranian ballistic missile attack, the US asked Saudi Arabia to provide interceptors for its defence, but Riyadh refused, MEE reported.
