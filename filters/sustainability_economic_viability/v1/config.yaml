      weight: 0.25
      description: "LCOE/unit cost vs fossil fuel alternatives"
      scale: |
        0-2: >5x fossil costs, no path to competitiveness
        3-4: 2-5x fossil costs, needs major subsidies
        5-6: Approaching parity, declining costs, modest subsidies
        7-8: Cost-competitive (parity), subsidy-independent
        9-10: Cheaper than fossil, disrupting incumbents
      requirements:
        - "Specific cost data (LCOE, $/unit)"
        - "Comparison to fossil baseline"
        - "Geographic context (costs vary by region)"

    profitability:
      weight: 0.20
      description: "Are green companies making money? Financial health"
      scale: |
        0-2: Massive losses, bankruptcy risk, no revenue
        3-4: Unprofitable, cash burn, dependent on funding rounds
        5-6: Path to profitability, positive unit economics
        7-8: Profitable, positive margins, sustainable business
        9-10: Highly profitable, outperforming fossil competitors
      indicators:
        high_profitability:
          - "Operating margin >15%"
          - "Profitable for X consecutive quarters"
          - "Revenue growth >30% YoY"
        low_profitability:
          - "Cash burn rate", "runway", "needs funding"
          - "Losses widen", "unprofitable"

    job_creation:
      weight: 0.15
      description: "Green jobs created vs fossil jobs displaced"
      scale: |
        0-2: Net job losses, automation with no replacement
        3-4: Some green jobs but fewer than fossil displaced
        5-6: Net neutral (green jobs ≈ fossil jobs lost)
        7-8: Net positive (more green jobs than fossil displaced)
        9-10: Massive job creation, quality jobs, wage premium
      requirements:
        - "Number of jobs created (direct + indirect)"
        - "Wage comparison to fossil jobs"
        - "Geographic distribution (just transition?)"

    stranded_assets:
      weight: 0.15
      description: "Fossil infrastructure becoming uneconomical"
      scale: |
        0-2: Fossil assets increasing in value
        3-4: Fossil stable, no stranding yet
        5-6: Some early retirements, writedowns beginning
        7-8: Significant stranding (coal plants closing early)
        9-10: Widespread asset stranding, fossil uneconomical
      examples:
        - "Coal plants retired early due to renewable competition → 8"
        - "Oil reserves written down as uneconomic → 9"
        - "Gas peaker plants replaced by batteries → 7"

    investment_flows:
      weight: 0.10
      description: "Capital moving to green tech"
      scale: |
        0-2: Divestment from green, capital fleeing
        3-4: Limited investment, niche venture funding
        5-6: Growing investment, corporate R&D increasing
        7-8: Major investment ($10B+ annually in sector)
        9-10: Investment dominates (green > fossil in new capital)
      examples:
        - "EV investment >$300B in 2024 → 10"
        - "Renewable energy investment >$500B/year → 9"
        - "Climate tech VC $50B/year → 8"

        5-6: 5-10 year payback
        7-8: 2-5 year payback
        9-10: <2 year payback
      examples:
        - "Rooftop solar: 6-8 year payback → 6"
        - "Heat pump: 5 year payback vs gas furnace → 7"
        - "LED bulbs: 1 year payback → 10"

    subsidy_dependence:
      weight: 0.04
      description: "Does it need subsidies to compete?"
      scale: |
        0-2: 100% subsidy-dependent, unviable without support
        3-4: Heavy subsidies needed (>50% of economics)
        5-6: Modest subsidies (~20-30%), approaching independence
        7-8: Minimal subsidies (<10%), nearly competitive
        9-10: Zero subsidies needed, profitable standalone
      note: "Lower dependence = higher score"

      description: "Broader economic benefits beyond direct costs"
      scale: |
        0-2: Negative externalities, economic drag

        7-8: Significant multiplier effects
        9-10: Transformative economic benefits
      examples:
        - "Energy independence (reduced oil imports) → 7"
