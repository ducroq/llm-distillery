{"id":"positive_news_the_better_india_2d2ea1aceaed","title":"Farmers in Kerala‚Äôs Wayanad Turned a Backyard Fruit Into a Booming Avocado Industry","content":"Nestled in the highlands of Kerala’s Wayanad district, Ambalavayal village basks in a cool subtropical climate — ideal for horticulture. Its landscape is richly layered with coffee, pepper, rice, ginger, turmeric, clove, cinnamon, and cool-season vegetables. Yet, it is the quiet rise of avocado cultivation — now a staple in nearly every backyard — that is reshaping the village’s identity. Just 10 km from Sulthan Bathery, Ambalavayal has become an unexpected epicentre for this creamy, nutrient-rich fruit. Commonly known as the butter fruit in India, avocado (Persea americana) originated in Mexico and was introduced to India by American missionaries from Sri Lanka in the 19th century. Ambalavayal’s avocados are known for their smooth, creamy texture and subtle blend of nutty and mildly sweet flavours — qualities that have earned them their affectionate local name. Their well-formed shape and vibrant skin reflect the region’s misty climate and fertile soil, which together lend the fruit its distinctive richness and appeal. It can grow and survive in various agro-climatic conditions, ranging from true tropical to the warmer parts of the temperate zone, depending on the race and variety. In India, it is grown on a limited scale as a homestead crop or intercrop in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and certain parts of the Northeast region. A 75-year-old legacy “Ambalavayal has a long association with avocados. We have a 75-year-old tree planted in 1947 by British officers as part of a post-war resettlement on our campus,” says Dr C K Yamini Varma, Associate Director of Research and Dean, Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS). “The planting material from this initiative was later distributed across Kerala, becoming the foundation for wider avocado cultivation.” Ambalavayal has a long association with avocados. It has a 75-year-old tree planted in 1947 by British officers. Today, RARS Ambalavayal safeguards a living repository of over 400 avocado trees, representing a diverse range of varieties including Tallack, Ellar, Round, Purple, and Fuerte. It was here that Kerala’s earliest scientific studies on avocado — including postgraduate research — first took root. The station now serves as a leading nursery and research hub, providing high-quality planting material to farmers across Kerala and neighbouring states. Why avocados matter Rich in monounsaturated fat, the consumption of avocado helps to lower LDL cholesterol and boost HDL cholesterol, contributing to cardiovascular health. Its pulp is a rich source of protein and fat (up to 30%) but low in carbohydrates. In India, avocado is mainly used for the preparation of milkshakes or consumed as fresh fruit by adding sugar. Generally, avocados are used for preparing guacamole, sandwich fillings, salads, ice creams, burgers, pizza, toast, etc. They are also used in the cosmetic industry for making shampoos, soaps, lipsticks, and face creams due to their high fat content. Three types of avocados “While the global market remains largely dominated by the Hass variety (accounting for over 80% of trade), other varieties — including hybrids of Mexican, Guatemalan, and West Indian origin — are gaining traction in the Indian market due to their broader availability, consumer acceptance, and competitive pricing. The avocado value chain encompasses sustainable farming, handling, and innovative processing for value addition,” said Dr Varma. In India, only two varieties have been released so far — TKD-1, the maiden avocado variety released in the country from the Horticulture Research Station, Thadiyankudisai (Tamil Nadu), and Arka Supreme, a high-yielding and regular-bearing seedling selection released from the Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Chettalli (Karnataka), according to Avocado Cultivation in India. Ambalavayal’s first avocado fest This July, Ambalavayal hosted its inaugural Avocado Fest — a collaborative effort by the Ambalavayal Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Wayanad Hill Farmer Producer Company, and the local Grama Panchayat. Over two days, the event drew nearly 500 farmers, reigniting enthusiasm and confidence in avocado cultivation. It featured expert training sessions on scientific farming methods, economic potential, value-added product innovations, and market strategies, aimed at helping farmers increase incomes and tap into new markets. People queing up at the entrance of the Avocado Fest. Farmers, researchers, and traders came together to explore advancements in avocado farming and branding. The event also included competitions for the best avocado and best avocado-based recipe, and recognition of top-performing farmers, which added to the festive spirit. Despite challenges such as recent price drops and issues in harvesting and packaging, the festival fostered optimism about the future of avocado farming in the region. There was a strong focus on innovation, quality improvement, and branding to elevate Ambalavayal avocados to the global market. Overall, the festival was a vibrant celebration of local agriculture and a platform for knowledge sharing and collective growth in the avocado sector. “We intend to make this an annual celebration,” said K Shameer, Vice-President of the Ambalavayal Grama Panchayat. “We aim to scale up avocado farming, which is seeing strong demand in urban markets, and thereby boost farmers’ earnings.” Rising hubs Thanks to the distinctive agro-climatic conditions of the Western Ghats, regions like Wayanad, Kodaikanal, and Madikeri have emerged as promising hubs for avocado cultivation. A growing network of farmers is already tapping into this potential. Dr Varma, the visionary behind the Avocado Fest, explains, “The avocado sector continues to grapple with deep-rooted challenges — from limited scientific clarity on optimal cultivation methods to poor post-harvest infrastructure and restricted opportunities for value addition and market access. In response, we launched the National Avocado Workshop: a vibrant forum for knowledge exchange that united experts from national research institutions, agricultural universities, policymakers, exporters, traders, and progressive farmers. Our mission was simple yet ambitious — to ignite collaborative conversations, showcase successful practices, and forge new pathways for sustainable avocado cultivation and enterprise growth across India.” With minimal investment and high returns ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 50,000 per plant when cultivated scientifically, avocado farming has become a lifeline — particularly as other crops have failed. Every year, tonnes of avocados are shipped from Ambalavayal, especially during June and July, further boosting its reputation as an agricultural hub. Rise of new growers A new generation of growers is turning this once pepper-and-coffee-dominated landscape into the state’s emerging avocado heartland. Among them is thirty-five-year-old Mohammed Mustafa, a hospitality postgraduate whose life took a verdant turn when he chose to nurture his family’s two-decade-old orchard. Mustafa in his avocado orchard. What began with his father’s modest planting of around 20 avocado trees has since blossomed into a thriving grove of over 300 trees under Mustafa’s stewardship. The orchard, shaded by the broad-leaved canopy of mature avocado trees, hums with quiet productivity. He says he’s picked up a practice from Kenyan farmers who keep their trees under six feet tall, since anything taller makes harvesting more challenging. “The survival rate of avocado seedlings is significantly higher than grafted ones,” Mustafa explains, gently cradling a fruit that weighs nearly a kilogram. “Grafted trees do bear fruit earlier, but the seedlings — though slower — yield much more in the long run.” His approach reflects a patient, long-view philosophy that’s increasingly common among Ambalavayal’s growers. Avocados in this region bear fruit twice annually — first in February and then again in June. The February crop is especially lucrative, fetching premium rates of Rs 300 to Rs 400 per kilogram. These rich, green fruits rarely linger in local markets; they’re quickly packed and dispatched to metropolitan hubs like Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, and Bengaluru, where the appetite for exotic produce is booming. In stark contrast, the June harvest struggles to find value, selling for a mere Rs 70 per kilogram due to oversupply, quality differences, and market timing. Lack of infrastructure Despite Ambalavayal’s rise as a thriving avocado hub — driven largely by the initiative of individual farmers — the lack of essential infrastructure such as cold storage, transport networks, and processing units continues to undermine their negotiating power with traders. Avocado growers here also face pest and disease challenges that threaten yield and fruit quality. Common pests include thrips, lace bugs, scale insects, spider mites, and fruit flies, which cause damage ranging from leaf discolouration and defoliation to scarring and premature fruit drop. Root diseases such as Phytophthora root rot and anthracnose further affect tree health and productivity. Together, these farmers are not just cultivating fruit — they’re cultivating a future. To address these, farmers follow an integrated pest management (IPM) approach — combining pruning, irrigation management, orchard hygiene, and the use of biological controls like neem oil and predatory mites. Regular monitoring, balanced fertilisation, and use of disease-resistant rootstocks help maintain healthy orchards and ensure high-quality fruits. New growers Martin Poulose, 36, is another key figure in this quiet revolution. On his sprawling 50-acre farm, where coffee, tea, and pepper once reigned supreme, he now cultivates 400 avocado trees. “I ramped up planting after Covid-19,” he says. “The pandemic changed consumer habits — suddenly, everyone wanted immunity-boosting, nutrient-rich fruits. Avocado fit the bill perfectly.” But for Mustafa, Poulose, and their close-knit circle of farmer-innovators, the journey doesn’t end at harvest. They’re now venturing into value addition, aiming to transform their produce into shelf-ready products. “We’ve zeroed in on two ideas — an avocado sandwich spread and ready-to-eat guacamole,” Mustafa shares with a grin.

Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g., 0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where $F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07086","published_date":"2025-10-09T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:05.065852","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Shinsaku Sakaue, Han Bao, Yuzhou Cao","raw_content_length":1491,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Non arXiv:2510.07086v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["P_T$","T$."]},"char_count":1490,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251007086v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Online structured prediction","online classification","a special case","the task","labels","input features","the surrogate regret","the cumulative excess"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251007086v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Online structured prediction":1.0,"online classification":1.0,"a special case":1.0,"the task":1.0,"labels":1.0,"input features":1.0,"the surrogate regret":1.0,"the cumulative excess":1.0}},"age_hours":14.722308699722221,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6758,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0585,"sadness":0.2306,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0107,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.8,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":true,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":true},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Online structured prediction algorithms for non-stationary energy systems","Dynamic regret bounds in online learning for grid flexibility"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Examples of online learning algorithms in smart grid control.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This paper explores online structured prediction for non-stationary environments, aiming to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms in dynamic systems.

On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising technology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude increase in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and stringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of order 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier transform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane, which serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium resolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform spectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to decrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform spectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while maintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present predicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also demonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000 line intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an example platform. We demonstrate that a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform spectrometer would be capable of R~1000 measurements of CO power spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10--100 with surveys of $10^5$--$10^6$ spectrometer hours.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06771","published_date":"2025-10-09T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:12.029955","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsins-det","astro-phim","astro-phga","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Chris S.

The TT group engaged in Tan Tui practice, while the CON group performed jogging. The intervention period was 14 weeks (3 times per week, 60 min each session). Absolute power of the alpha frequency band was assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and after 14 weeks (post-intervention) for brain regions related to cognitive function and sensorimotor function.Results(1) Absolute Brain Power: Compared to the control group, the experimental group showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in alpha band power in brain regions associated with cognitive function (prefrontal: FP1, FPz, FP2; temporal: T8, P7; occipital: O1) and sensorimotor function (posterior frontal: F7, F3, FZ; parietal: P3, P4; central: C3, CZ). Compared to pre-intervention, the experimental group showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in alpha band power after training in cognitive function (prefrontal: FPz; temporal: T7, T8, P7, P8; occipital: O1) and sensorimotor function (posterior frontal, parietal, and central lobes). (2) Brain Region Symmetry: Compared to the control group, the difference in alpha band power between the left and right hemispheres of the occipital lobe (cognitive function) and central lobe (sensorimotor function) showed significant differences (p < 0.05) after training. Compared to pre-intervention, the experimental group showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in alpha band power after training in sensorimotor function (posterior frontal and central lobes). (3) Brain Region Synergy: Compared to pre-intervention, the experimental group showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) in the synergy between the prefrontal and occipital lobes, and the temporal and occipital lobes, which are cognitive function brain regions. After training, there was a significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) in the synergy among sensorimotor function brain regions. Furthermore, after training, there was a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) in the synergy between different sensorimotor function brain regions (posterior frontal, parietal, central) and cognitive function-related brain regions.ConclusionA 14-week systematic traditional martial arts Tan Tui training program can significantly enhance cortical excitability, improve functional symmetry between the left and right brain hemispheres, and strengthen the synergy among multiple brain regions in obese college students. Our findings demonstrate that traditional martial arts practice induces measurable neural plasticity and improves postural control and brain function in populations.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_0309b2ad4048","title":"The influence of the ownership effect on Chinese children's learning performance: a comparative study between choosing and assigning ownership acquisition styles","content":"The cultural context can regulate the ownership effect, thus affecting learning performance and object memory. Previous studies have discussed the influence of ownership effect on children's learning based on the choosing and assigning ownership acquisition style. However, for Chinese children growing up in an interdependent cultural context, it is unclear the differences in the impact of ownership effects on learning performance in the two ownership acquisition styles when intimate others are involved in the learning process. In this study, an independent two-factor mixed experimental design was adopted: 2 (ownership acquisition style: choosing and assigning) × 3 (ownership condition: self, mother/friend/teacher, and others). Each experiment recruited approximately eighty third-grade Chinese students aged 7–9 years old. They were asked to place a series of pictures of themselves, intimate others (mother, friend, or teacher), and strangers in baskets according to color cues (assigning) or self-choice (choosing). They then completed a free-recall task. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted on the correct free recall rate, and the results were as follows: Performance under the chosen ownership acquisition style was better than that under the assigned ownership acquisition style. There was no significant difference between the learning performance in the condition of mother and self-ownership, but both were higher than the learning performance in the condition of others-ownership. Learning performance in the self-ownership and friend-ownership conditions were significantly higher than that in the others-ownership condition, and performance in the self-ownership condition was significantly higher than that in the friends-ownership condition. Performance in the self-ownership condition was significantly higher than that in the teacher-ownership and others-ownership conditions, whereas the performance in the teacher-ownership condition was not significantly different from that in the others-ownership condition. Our findings showed that, for Chinese children, mothers' involvement in children's learning performance was just as beneficial as self-involvement in the ownership teaching situation. Although learning performance in the condition of friend-involvement was not as good as that for self-involvement, it can improve learning performance. However, learning performance was the poorest in the teacher-involvement condition.

Inductive proximity sensor (IPS) technology is becoming a more popular solution in the field of short distances. Because of its small size, dependability, and measurement capabilities, IPS is a good option. Separate circuits are used in the classical structures to generate the excitation signal for the sensor coil and measure the response signal. The response signal’s amplitude is typically measured. This article proposes an IPS model that uses frequency response as its basis for operation. A microcontroller and embedded technology are used to implement a small IPS structure. This includes the circuit for determining distance, as well as the signal generator used to excite the sensor coil. In essence, an LC circuit is employed, which at the unit step has a damped oscillatory response by nature. Periodically injecting energy into the LC circuit, however, causes it to enter a persistent oscillatory state. The full experimental model is implemented and presented in the article, illustrating how the distance can be measured with a 33 µm accuracy within the 10 mm range with the help of the nonlinear relationship between frequency and distance and the linear drift of frequency with temperature.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6258","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:21.392002","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Alexandra Fodor","raw_content_length":1409,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IPS"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1389,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Design","Implementation","an Inductive Proximity Sensor","Embedded Systems","IPS","Non-mechanical contact distance measurement solutions","various industries","monitoring"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Design","Embedded Systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Design":2.0,"Implementation":2.0,"an Inductive Proximity Sensor":2.0,"Embedded Systems":2.0,"IPS":2.0,"Non-mechanical contact distance measurement solutions":1.0,"various industries":1.0,"monitoring":1.0}},"age_hours":18.735309360277775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.254,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8508,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.914,"joy":0.0282,"surprise":0.0272,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0113,"anger":0.0086,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":6.3,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":true,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":true,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Optimization of inductive proximity sensor for building monitoring applications","Development of temperature compensation algorithms for IPS","Integration of IPS with building automation systems"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Integration into sensor technology and embedded systems courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Lab setup for IPS experimentation and data acquisition."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article presents an inductive proximity sensor (IPS) model using frequency response for distance measurement, implemented with a microcontroller.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_a353190020f5","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6259: Attention","content":"Accurately predicting the reception area of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) is critical for ship tracking and anomaly detection, as errors in signal interpretation may lead to incorrect vessel localization and behavior analysis. However, traditional propagation models, whether they are deterministic, empirical, or semi-empirical, face limitations when applied to dynamic environments due to their reliance on detailed atmospheric and terrain inputs. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose a data-driven approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to model AIS reception as a function of environmental and geographic variables. Specifically, inspired by attention mechanisms that power transformers in large language models, our framework employs the SAmple and aggreGatE (GraphSAGE) framework convolutions to aggregate neighborhood features, then combines layer outputs through Jumping Knowledge (JK) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-derived attention coefficients and integrates an attentional pooling module at the graph-level readout. Moreover, trained on real-world AIS data enriched with terrain and meteorological features, the model captures both local and long-range reception patterns. As a result, it outperforms classical baselines—including ITU-R P.2001 and XGBoost in F1-score and accuracy. Ultimately, this work illustrates the value of deep learning and AIS sensor networks for the detection of positioning anomalies in ship tracking and highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in modeling sensor reception.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6259","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:21.392348","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Aldo Napoli","raw_content_length":1588,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Automatic Identification System","AIS"],"persons":["Vol","Bidirectional Long Short-Te"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1578,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Attention","the reception area","the Automatic Identification System","AIS","ship tracking","anomaly detection","errors","signal interpretation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AIS"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Attention":2.0,"the reception area":1.0,"the Automatic Identification System":1.0,"AIS":1.0,"ship tracking":1.0,"anomaly detection":1.0,"errors":1.0,"signal interpretation":1.0}},"age_hours":18.735324354444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8173,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0086,"sadness":0.0211,"fear":0.1031,"anger":0.0205,"disgust":0.0233},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":7,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":8,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":6.625,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Optimization of GNN models for AIS reception prediction in dynamic environments","Impact of meteorological features on AIS signal propagation in the North Sea","Comparison of data-driven and traditional propagation models for maritime anomaly detection"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Integration into courses on sensor networks, data analytics, and maritime technology.","hands_on_opportunities":"Opportunities to work with real-world AIS data and develop/test GNN models."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article presents a data-driven approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict AIS reception for improved ship tracking and anomaly detection.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_9ad81d342823","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6256: ASFT","content":"Objective evaluation of pilot fatigue is crucial for enhancing aviation safety. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is regarded as an effective tool for recognizing pilot fatigue, the direct application of deep learning models to raw EEG signals faces significant challenges due to issues such as massive data volume, excessively long training time, and model overfitting. Moreover, existing feature-based methods often suffer from data redundancy due to the lack of effective feature and channel selections, which compromises the model’s recognition efficiency and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework, named ASFT-Transformer, for fast and accurate detection of pilot fatigue. This framework first extracts time-domain and frequency-domain features from the four EEG frequency bands. Subsequently, it introduces a feature and channel selection strategy based on one-way analysis of variance and support vector machine (ANOVA-SVM) to identify the most fatigue-relevant features and pivotal EEG channels. Finally, the FT-Transformer (Feature Tokenizer + Transformer) model is employed for classification based on the selected features, transforming the fatigue recognition problem into a tabular data classification task. EEG data is collected from 32 pilots before and after actual simulator training to validate the proposed method. The results show that ASFT-Transformer achieved average accuracies of 97.24% and 87.72% based on cross-clip data partitioning and cross-subject data partitioning, which were significantly superior to several mainstream machine learning and deep learning models. Under the two types of cross-validation, the proposed feature and channel selection strategy not only improved the average accuracy by 2.45% and 8.07%, respectively, but also drastically reduced the average training time from above 1 h to under 10 min. This study offers civil aviation authorities and airline operators a tool to manage pilot fatigue objectively and effectively, thereby contributing to flight safety.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6256","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:21.392706","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":286,"author":"Zhenxing Gao","raw_content_length":2056,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.43,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ASFT-Transformer","EEG","ANOVA-SVM"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2046,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","ASFT","pilot fatigue","Objective evaluation","aviation safety","electroencephalography","EEG","an effective tool","the direct application"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"ASFT":2.0,"pilot fatigue":2.0,"Objective evaluation":1.0,"aviation safety":1.0,"electroencephalography":1.0,"EEG":1.0,"an effective tool":1.0,"the direct application":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73533999527778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8609,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0102,"sadness":0.0365,"fear":0.0478,"anger":0.0192,"disgust":0.0208},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":5.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Optimization of feature selection for EEG-based fatigue detection","Transfer learning of fatigue detection models across different pilot populations","Integration of ASFT-Transformer with real-time pilot monitoring systems"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Can be integrated into signal processing and machine learning courses within the energy engineering curriculum.","hands_on_opportunities":"Students can work with EEG data and implement the ASFT-Transformer framework in a lab setting."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This paper presents ASFT-Transformer, a novel framework for fast and accurate detection of pilot fatigue using EEG data and machine learning.

It evaluated the impact of sensor quantity and sample size on prediction model accuracy and generalizability, providing evidence for personalized training-load monitoring. Fifty badminton players (25 elite, 25 enthusiasts) performed treadmill running, cycling, rope skipping, and stair walking. Data were collected using accelerometers (waist, wrists, ankles), a heart rate monitor, and indirect calorimetry (criterion EE). Multiple machine learning models (Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) were employed to develop EE prediction models. Performance was assessed using R2, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE), with further evaluation via the Triple-E framework (Effectiveness, Efficiency, Extension). Elite athletes demonstrated stable, coordinated movement patterns, achieving the best values for R2 and the smallest errors using minimal core sensors (typically dominant side). Enthusiasts required multi-site sensors to compensate for greater execution variability. Increasing sensors beyond three yielded no performance gains; optimal configurations involved 2–3 core accelerometers combined with heart rate data. Expanding sample size significantly enhanced model stability and generalizability (e.g., running task R2 increased from 0.49 (N = 20) to 0.95 (N = 40)). Triple-E evaluation indicated that strategic sensor minimization coupled with sufficient sample size maximized predictive performance while reducing computational cost and deployment burden. Competitive level significantly influences EE modeling requirements. Elite athletes are suited to a “low-sensor, small-sample” scenario, whereas enthusiasts necessitate a “multi-sensor, large-sample” strategy.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6257","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:21.393079","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Kuan Tao","raw_content_length":1957,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Effectiveness","Random Forest","Linear Regression,"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["Bayesian Ridge Regression"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1907,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Energy","This study","differences","energy-expenditure EE modeling","badminton players","varying competitive levels","aerobic training","the impact"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["Energy"],"renewable_energy":["Energy"],"research_academic":["This study"],"ai_ml":["aerobic training"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Energy":2.0,"This study":1.0,"differences":1.0,"energy-expenditure EE modeling":1.0,"badminton players":1.0,"varying competitive levels":1.0,"aerobic training":1.0,"the impact":1.0}},"age_hours":18.735355779166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8668,"joy":0.0143,"surprise":0.0136,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0256,"anger":0.0306,"disgust":0.0432},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":2,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":true,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":5.4,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Sensor optimization for energy expenditure modeling in athletes","Machine learning model development for personalized training load monitoring","Impact of sensor quantity and sample size on EE prediction accuracy"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Use as a case study in sensor technology and data analytics courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Potential for lab setups to replicate the sensor data collection and model development process."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study focuses on optimizing sensor configurations and sample sizes for energy expenditure modeling in athletes, using machine learning.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_d8ac9405c86b","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6255: MLG","content":"Industrial image anomaly detection (IAD) is crucial for quality control, but its performance often degrades when training data contain label noise. To circumvent the reliance on potentially flawed labels, unsupervised methods that learn from the data distribution itself have become a mainstream approach. Among various unsupervised techniques, student–teacher frameworks have emerged as a highly effective paradigm. Student–Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching (STPM) is a powerful method within this paradigm, yet it is susceptible to such noise. Inspired by STPM and aiming to solve this issue, this paper introduces Meta-Learning Guided STPM (MLG-STPM), a novel framework that enhances STPM’s robustness by incorporating a guidance mechanism inspired by meta-learning. This guidance is achieved through an Evolving Meta-Set (EMS), which dynamically maintains a small high-confidence subset of training samples identified by their low disagreement between student and teacher networks. By training the student network on a combination of the current batch and the EMS, MLG-STPM effectively mitigates the impact of noisy labels without requiring an external clean dataset or complex re-weighting schemes. Comprehensive experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise (0% to 20%) demonstrate that MLG-STPM significantly improves anomaly detection and localization performance compared to the original STPM, especially under higher noise conditions, and achieves competitive results against other relevant approaches.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6255","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:21.393402","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Jing-Kai Wang","raw_content_length":1578,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Meta-Learning Guided STPM","MLG-STPM","EMS","IAD"],"persons":["Evolving Meta-Set","Vol","STPM"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1548,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","MLG","Industrial image anomaly detection","IAD","quality control","its performance","training data","label noise","the reliance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MLG"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"MLG":2.0,"Industrial image anomaly detection":1.0,"IAD":1.0,"quality control":1.0,"its performance":1.0,"training data":1.0,"label noise":1.0,"the reliance":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73537129888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.133,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5734,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9211,"joy":0.0038,"surprise":0.0104,"sadness":0.0122,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0252},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.95,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":true,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Anomaly detection in industrial images using meta-learning","Robustness of student-teacher frameworks in noisy environments","Evolving Meta-Set optimization for industrial quality control"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Integration into machine learning and industrial automation courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Implementation and testing of MLG-STPM on industrial image datasets."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This paper introduces Meta-Learning Guided STPM (MLG-STPM), a novel framework for industrial image anomaly detection that enhances robustness to label noise using a meta-learning guidance mechanism.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_de05bf359810","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 3971: Spiking Neural Network","content":"Associative learning is a fundamental neural mechanism in human memory and cognition. It has attracted considerable attention in neuromorphic system design owing to its multimodal integration, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency. However, prior studies mostly focused on single inputs, with limited attention to multibit pairs or recall under non-orthogonal input patterns. To address these issues, this study proposes a bidirectional associative learning system using paired multibit inputs. It employs a synapse–neuron structure based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) that emulate biological learning, with simple circuits supporting synaptic operations and pattern evaluation. Importantly, the update and read functions were designed by drawing inspiration from the operational characteristics of emerging synaptic devices, thereby ensuring future compatibility with device-level implementations. The proposed system was verified through Cadence-based simulations using CMOS neurons and Verilog-A synapses. The results show that all patterns are reliably recalled under intact synaptic conditions, and most patterns are still robustly recalled under biologically plausible conditions such as partial synapse loss or noisy initial synaptic weight states. Moreover, by avoiding massive data converters and relying only on basic digital gates, the proposed design achieves associative learning with a simple structure. This provides an advantage for future extension to large-scale arrays.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/19/3971","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.151826","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Joon Young Kwak","raw_content_length":1503,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1493,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Spiking Neural Network","Associative learning","a fundamental neural mechanism","human memory","cognition","considerable attention","neuromorphic system design","its multimodal integration"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Spiking Neural Network":2.0,"Associative learning":1.0,"a fundamental neural mechanism":1.0,"human memory":1.0,"cognition":1.0,"considerable attention":1.0,"neuromorphic system design":1.0,"its multimodal integration":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73636550388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8977,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0242,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0196,"anger":0.0181,"disgust":0.0256},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":8,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":5.6,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":true,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":true,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Synaptic device emulation using Verilog-A","CMOS neuron design and optimization","Spiking neural network architecture for energy-efficient associative learning"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Integration into neuromorphic computing or AI hardware courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Cadence-based simulations and Verilog-A modeling of synaptic devices."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This paper presents a spiking neural network (SNN) system for associative learning, focusing on energy efficiency and compatibility with emerging synaptic devices.

This paper focuses on studying the behavior of e-textile functional aging and alleviating its impact on text input with an unsupervised domain adaptation technique, named A2TEXT (aging-aware e-textile-based text input). We first designed a deep kernel-based two-sample test method to validate the impact of functional aging on handwriting with an e-textile input.

Our novel method introduces a speed feedback channel at the output of the PI controller to synthesize equivalent viscous damping, thereby enhancing system stability without compromising responsiveness. Through rigorous simulation and experimental validation, the proposed controller’s effectiveness is demonstrated.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_ea4c6667fb8c","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 3968: Towards Robust Scene Text Recognition: A Dual Correction Mechanism with Deformable Alignment","content":"Scene Text Recognition (STR) faces significant challenges under complex degradation conditions, such as distortion, occlusion, and semantic ambiguity. Most existing methods rely heavily on language priors for correction, but effectively constructing language rules remains a complex problem. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) The over-correction behavior of language models, particularly on semantically deficient input, can result in both recognition errors and loss of critical information. (2) Character misalignment in visual features, which affects recognition accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a Deformable-Alignment-based Dual Correction Mechanism (DADCM) for STR. Our method includes the following key components: (1) We propose a visually guided and language-assisted correction strategy. A dynamic confidence threshold is used to control the degree of language model intervention. (2) We designed a visual backbone network called SCRTNet. The net enhances key text regions through a channel attention module (SENet) and applies deformable convolution (DCNv4) in deep layers to better model distorted or curved text. (3) We propose a deformable alignment module (DAM). The module combines Gumbel-Softmax-based anchor sampling and geometry-aware self-attention to improve character alignment. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Especially on the Union14M-Benchmark, where the recognition accuracy surpasses previous methods by 1.1%, 1.6%, 3.0%, and 1.3% on the Curved, Multi-Oriented, Contextless, and General subsets, respectively.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/19/3968","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.154106","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Changlu Li","raw_content_length":1618,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DADCM","STR"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1618,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Robust Scene Text Recognition","A Dual Correction Mechanism","Deformable Alignment","Scene Text Recognition","STR","significant challenges","complex degradation conditions","distortion"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Robust Scene Text Recognition":2.0,"A Dual Correction Mechanism":2.0,"Deformable Alignment":2.0,"Scene Text Recognition":1.0,"STR":1.0,"significant challenges":1.0,"complex degradation conditions":1.0,"distortion":1.0}},"age_hours":18.736429584444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8685,"joy":0.0032,"surprise":0.014,"sadness":0.0116,"fear":0.0385,"anger":0.0209,"disgust":0.0434},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.0,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Improvement of deformable alignment module for specific text types (e.g., energy labels)","Application of SCRTNet to smart meter data recognition","Analysis of the impact of different degradation conditions on STR accuracy"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"The concepts of channel attention modules (SENet) and deformable convolution (DCNv4) can be integrated into image processing courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Students could experiment with the DADCM model and benchmark datasets to understand the challenges of scene text recognition."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This paper introduces a Deformable-Alignment-based Dual Correction Mechanism (DADCM) for Scene Text Recognition (STR), improving accuracy under complex degradation conditions.

This study attempts to develop an analytical framework which adopts dual axes of pathways of institutional change and levels of innovation for multidimensional analysis of social innovation. Drawing on this dual-axis framework, this study examined 121 social businesses in developing countries. These businesses were operated by social innovators who had been recognized as Ashoka Fellows between 2006 and 2025. Analysis of the cases revealed that the most prevalent type of early-stage social innovation was the peripheral-user type, inducing change at the user level from the periphery of the system. Moreover, the most frequently observed type of transition was from the peripheral-user type to the integrated-service wherein the innovation became partially integrated into the system and changes at the service level. What these findings suggest is that social innovations start at the user level, expand into services, and, in some cases, reach the system level. They move step by step into deeper forms of institutional integration.

Accordingly, the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the prioritization of mitigation strategies are of particular importance. In this study, a comprehensive campus-level GHG inventory was prepared for a public university in Türkiye in alignment with the ISO 14064-1:2018 standard, and mitigation strategies were evaluated. To prioritize these strategies, both the classical Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC) index and, for the first time in the literature, a fuzzy extension of the PMC model was applied. The results reveal that the total GHG emissions for 2023 amounted to 4888.63 tCO2e (1.19 tCO2e per capita), with the largest shares originating from investments (31%) and purchased electricity (28.38%). While the classical PMC identified only two high-priority actions, the fuzzy PMC reduced score dispersion, resolved ranking ties, and expanded the number of high-priority actions to seven. The top strategies include awareness programs, energy-efficiency measures, virtual meeting practices, advanced electricity monitoring, and improved data management systems. By comparing the classical and fuzzy approaches, the study demonstrates that integrating fuzzy logic enhances the transparency, reproducibility, and robustness of strategy prioritization, thereby offering a practical roadmap for campus decarbonization and sustainability policy in higher education institutions.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8966","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.344656","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Fatma Şener Fidan","raw_content_length":1552,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ISO","PMC","GHG","a Public University Higher"],"persons":["Modeling Consistency"],"locations":["Türkiye"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1543,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Fuzzy Logic","Enhanced PMC Index","Policies","Decarbonization","Higher Education","Evidence","a Public University","mitigation strategies"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"research_academic":["a Public University"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Fuzzy Logic":2.0,"Enhanced PMC Index":2.0,"Policies":2.0,"Decarbonization":2.0,"Higher Education":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"a Public University":2.0,"mitigation strategies":2.0}},"age_hours":18.736761665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8937,"joy":0.0365,"surprise":0.0239,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0146,"disgust":0.02},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":4,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":5.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":true,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Public university in Türkiye","country":"Türkiye","collaboration_type":"Data sharing, methodology application"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Application of fuzzy logic to energy policy prioritization","GHG inventory development and mitigation strategy analysis","Comparison of classical and fuzzy PMC methods for decarbonization"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Integration of fuzzy logic and GHG inventory methodologies into energy engineering courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Potential for students to apply the fuzzy PMC method to real-world campus decarbonization projects."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study applies a fuzzy logic-enhanced Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC) index to prioritize decarbonization strategies at a university in Türkiye.

As one of the “second water sources”, the full utilization of highly mineralized mine water (HMMW) is a key strategy for promoting sustainable development in water-scarce regions. It has obvious resource, environmental, and economic benefits that are central to sustainability. However, the mechanism of the impact of HMMW utilization on water utilization, the environment, and the economy is still unclear, making it difficult to evaluate its overall sustainability performance and to provide scientific data support to promote HMMW utilization. Therefore, this paper develops a novel sustainability-oriented accounting framework to assess the environmental–economic sustainability of HMMW utilization. Firstly, this paper proposes the method of calculating the HMMW utilization environmental benefits, proposes a novel integrated environmental–economic input–output accounting framework, which refines the HMMW sector from the traditional water industry and integrates the environmental benefits into a balanced input–output table. Secondly, taking Ningdong Energy Chemical Industry Base (NECI Base) as an example, this paper conducts applied research on the integrated environmental–economic accounting of HMMW utilization: (I) The HMMW environmental benefits of NECI Base are calculated, the utilization of 22.69 million m3 of HMMW generated environmental benefits, valued at 233.69 million CNY, demonstrating its substantial contribution to environmental sustainability.

Originating largely from international practice, SIA requires localization to fit national conditions. This research examines an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan project in Hubei Province, China, comparing the SIA conducted under ADB procedures with China’s domestic practice of social stability risk assessment (SSRA)—China’s localized practice of SIA. Adopting a full project life cycle perspective, this article conducts a comprehensive gap analysis between SIA and SSRA from five key dimensions: cycle requirement of assessment, implementation of assessment activity, assessment outcome, application of assessment outcome, and assessment objective. While both approaches are quite similar in four aspects (assessment subject, assessment principle, risk investigation method, and risk classification), SIA places greater emphasis on social sustainability dimensions (poverty, gender, ethnic minority, and involuntary resettlement), whereas SSRA mainly focuses on social stability during the early project proposal and feasibility study stages. Building on the preceding analysis and comparison between SIA and SSRA, this research proposes a “Social Stability–Social Sustainability” progressive framework. Social stability serves as the foundational condition, while the framework emphasizes enhancing the long-term adaptive capacity of social governance through inclusion, participation, and resilience, thereby achieving genuine social sustainability.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8963","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.345403","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Zhiyang He","raw_content_length":1641,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Sustainable Development Goals","ADB","SSRA","SIA","Asian Development Bank","China Social","Social Stability to Social Sustainability"],"persons":[],"locations":["Hubei Province","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1581,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SIA","China","Pages","Social Stability","Social Sustainability","SSRA","an ADB Loan Project","Social impact assessment","a key tool","the Sustainable Development Goals"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Social Sustainability"],"engineering":["the Sustainable Development Goals"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SIA":5.0,"China":3.0,"Pages":2.0,"Social Stability":2.0,"Social Sustainability":2.0,"SSRA":2.0,"an ADB Loan Project":2.0,"Social impact assessment":1.0,"a key tool":1.0,"the Sustainable Development Goals":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73679364277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8349,"joy":0.0116,"surprise":0.0105,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0577,"anger":0.0351,"disgust":0.0436},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":7,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.4,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[{"name":"Asian Development Bank (ADB)","country":"International","funding_type":"Loan"}],"deployment_sites":[{"location":"Hubei Province, China","capacity":"Unspecified","status":"operational"}]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Comparative analysis of SIA and SSRA frameworks in energy projects","Developing a progressive framework for social stability and sustainability in infrastructure development"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Case study for sustainable development project management.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article compares Social Impact Assessment (SIA) and Social Stability Risk Assessment (SSRA) in an ADB loan project in China, focusing on social sustainability dimensions.

The results indicate that environmental auditing significantly enhances the synergy of environmental governance, mainly by raising public environmental awareness, promoting industrial clustering, and fostering green innovation. Additionally, green finance provides complementary support to this process. This effect is particularly pronounced in regions with higher levels of marketization, more developed financial technology, and greater environmental expenditure. Based on these findings, this study concludes that environmental auditing plays a crucial role in promoting China’s coordinated goals of “pollution reduction, carbon mitigation, ecological expansion, and growth.” In particular, environmental auditing demonstrates its institutional value in promoting sustainable governance, especially in developing economies.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8962","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.345724","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Qiuhua Chen","raw_content_length":1307,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1247,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Government Environmental Auditing","Synergistic Governance Outcomes","Evidence","Chinese Cities","This study","the role","government environmental auditing","Chinas coordinated goals"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Government Environmental Auditing":2.0,"Synergistic Governance Outcomes":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"Chinese Cities":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the role":1.0,"government environmental auditing":1.0,"Chinas coordinated goals":1.0}},"age_hours":18.736809242777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8909,"joy":0.0396,"surprise":0.0367,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":7,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":8,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.95,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of environmental auditing on green innovation","Role of green finance in supporting environmental governance","Analysis of industrial clustering and environmental performance"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Can be used as a case study for environmental policy and governance in developing economies.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study analyzes the impact of government environmental auditing on environmental governance in Chinese cities, finding that it promotes pollution reduction, carbon mitigation, ecological expansion, and economic growth.

However, existing studies insufficiently cover the driving mechanisms and scenario prediction for energy-importing provinces. This study can provide theoretical references for similar provinces in China to conduct research on carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption. The carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu Province between 2000 and 2023 were calculated using the carbon emission coefficient method. The Tapio decoupling index model was adopted to evaluate the decoupling relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu. An extended STIRPAT model was established to predict carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu, and this model was applied to analyze the emissions under three scenarios (baseline scenario, low-carbon scenario, and enhanced low-carbon scenario) during 2024–2030. The results show the following: (1) During 2000–2023, the carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu Province ranged from 215.22428 million tons to 783.94270 million tons, with an average of 549.96280 million tons. (2) The decoupling status between carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption and economic development in Jiangsu was dominated by weak decoupling, accounting for 91.304%, while a small proportion (8.696%) of expansive coupling was also observed. (3) Under the baseline scenario, the carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu in 2030 will reach 796.828 million tons; under the low-carbon scenario, the emissions will be 786.355 million tons; and under the enhanced low-carbon scenario, the emissions will be 772.293 million tons. Furthermore, countermeasures and suggestions for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu are proposed, mainly including strengthening the guidance of policies and institutional systems, optimizing the energy consumption structure, intensifying technological innovation efforts, and enhancing government promotion and publicity.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8961","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.346121","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":299,"author":"Heyao Tan","raw_content_length":2271,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.495,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tapio","Model Construction and Scenario Analysis for Carbon Dioxide Emissions"],"persons":[],"locations":["Jiangsu Province","China","Jiangsu"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2221,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Model Construction and Scenario Analysis","Carbon Dioxide Emissions","Energy Consumption","Jiangsu Province","the STIRPAT Extended Model","the backdrop","Chinas dual carbon strategy","carbon peaking"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Model Construction and Scenario Analysis":2.0,"Carbon Dioxide Emissions":2.0,"Energy Consumption":2.0,"Jiangsu Province":2.0,"the STIRPAT Extended Model":2.0,"the backdrop":1.0,"Chinas dual carbon strategy":1.0,"carbon peaking":1.0}},"age_hours":18.7368250675,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7281,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0071,"sadness":0.0128,"fear":0.1426,"anger":0.0493,"disgust":0.0523},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":6,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":5.1,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":true,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Modeling and scenario analysis of carbon emissions in energy-importing regions","Decoupling analysis of economic growth and carbon emissions in Jiangsu Province","Impact of policy interventions on carbon emission reduction in Jiangsu Province"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of applying STIRPAT model for regional carbon emission analysis.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study models and predicts carbon emissions from energy consumption in Jiangsu Province, China, under different scenarios.

Business Sustainability is conceptualized as the achievement of balanced outcomes across economic performance, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. It addresses a theoretical debate by testing two competing SCA models: a disaggregated model (which separates SCA into Customer Experience Advantage (CEA) and Operational Efficiency Advantage (OEA)) and a holistic model (which treats SCA as a unified construct). Data from 115 certified green hotels were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results revealed a critical distinction between the models. In the disaggregated model, SMA and SCK contributed to both CEA and OEA, but only OEA directly enhanced BS and served as a partial mediator in the relationships from both SMA and SCK to BS, whereas CEA showed no significant mediating effects. Conversely, the holistic model demonstrated that overall SCA served as a partial mediator in the relationships from both SMA and SCK to BS, while also exerting a strong direct effect on BS. The study concludes that achieving business sustainability requires a holistic SCA that integrates both operational efficiency and customer experience, offering a comprehensive framework for strategic management in the hotel industry.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_d2c7647704e2","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 8960: From Agricultural Waste to Green Binder: Performance Optimization of Wheat Straw Ash in Sustainable Cement Mortars","content":"This study investigates the use of wheat straw ash (WSA) as a sustainable supplementary cementitious material, focusing on its mechanical performance optimization and environmental implications. WSA (ASTM C618, Class F), produced via controlled calcination at 700 °C, was used to replace cement at 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10% by mass. The optimal performance was observed at 5% substitution, achieving a 90-day compressive strength of 48.42 MPa (+4.7%) and a 28-day flexural strength of 7.93 MPa (+6.6%). To contextualize these findings, a multi-technique analytical approach was employed, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV). These methods confirmed that WSA enhances portlandite consumption through pozzolanic reactivity and improves matrix densification via secondary C-S-H gel formation. Additionally, satellite (Sentinel-5P) and ground-based measurements during a severe stubble fire event in Diyarbakir (20–24 June 2024) documented a fourfold increase in PM10 concentrations (157 μg/m3 compared to the June average of ≈35 μg/m3), alongside 23% and 41% rises in NO2 and SO2 levels, respectively. These findings demonstrate that wheat straw ash utilization can mitigate agricultural waste burning, improve air quality, and reduce the carbon footprint of cement production.

Using panel data from 2006 to 2021, this study systematically investigates the three-dimensional coupling coordination among carbon emission efficiency, carbon sink capacity, and high-quality development in the Greater Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration. The spatiotemporal evolution, spatial correlation characteristics, and influencing factors of the coupling coordination were also explored. The results indicate that the coupling coordination system exhibits an evolutionary trend of overall stability with localized differentiation. The overall coupling degree remains in the “running-in” stage, while the coordination level is still in a marginally coordinated state. Spatially, the pattern has shifted from “northern leadership” to “multi-polar support,” with Yueyang achieving intermediate coordination, four cities including Changde reaching primary coordination, and three cities including Loudi remaining imbalanced. Spatial correlation has weakened from significant to insignificant, with Xiangtan showing a “low–low” cluster and Hengyang displaying a “high–low” cluster. The evolution of hot and cold spots has moved from marked differentiation to a more balanced distribution, as reflected by the disappearance of cold spots. The empirical analysis confirms a three-dimensional coupling mechanism: ecologically rich regions attain high coordination through carbon sink synergies; economically advanced areas achieve decoupling through innovation-driven development; while traditional industrial cities, despite facing the “green paradox,” demonstrate potential for leapfrog progress through transformation. Among the influencing factors, industrial structure upgrading emerged as the primary driver of spatial differentiation, though with a negative impact. Government support also exhibited a negative effect, whereas the interaction between environmental regulation and both government support and economic development was found to be significant.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8957","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.347205","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":277,"author":"Dan Sun","raw_content_length":2342,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.385,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Spatio-Temporal Coupling of Carbon Efficiency","High-Quality Development"],"persons":["Carbon Sink"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2182,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Spatio-Temporal Coupling","Carbon Efficiency","Carbon Sink","High-Quality Development","the Greater Chang","carbon emission efficiency","carbon sink capacity","the framework"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["High-Quality Development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Spatio-Temporal Coupling":2.0,"Carbon Efficiency":2.0,"Carbon Sink":2.0,"High-Quality Development":2.0,"the Greater Chang":2.0,"carbon emission efficiency":2.0,"carbon sink capacity":2.0,"the framework":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73687618388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.259500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8519,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9343,"joy":0.0108,"surprise":0.0136,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0058,"anger":0.0147,"disgust":0.0135},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":7,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":8,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":true},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":true,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":["Chang-Zhu-Tan"],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of coupling coordination mechanisms for carbon emission efficiency and carbon sink capacity.","Impact of industrial structure upgrading on spatial differentiation of carbon efficiency.","Role of government support and environmental regulation in promoting carbon sink synergies."],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of regional sustainability analysis and policy implications.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study analyzes the coupling coordination of carbon emission efficiency, carbon sink capacity, and high-quality development in the Greater Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration.

Using a participatory mapping approach over three weeks in September 2024, the research assessed the range, condition, and distribution of smartphones across central and neighborhood markets. Descriptive statistics and spatial analysis illustrate key trends. Results show a market heavily structured around second-hand smartphones, where device quality and prices adjust to economic power. Imported second-hand devices are often high-end, with prices above many new items of cheaper brands, while locally used items have much depreciated prices compared to either new or imported second-hand ones. Market locations are widespread for common items and clustered for specialized devices, consistent with central place theory.

Leadership effectiveness is particularly critical in environments where trust is limited, as it shapes both immediate performance and long-term organizational resilience. Using survey data from 375 employees across three telecom companies in Iraq, the results indicate that servant leadership is positively related to employee performance. Mediation analysis further demonstrates that organizational trust significantly transmits the effect of servant leadership on performance. These results extend current knowledge of leadership dynamics in the telecom sector and underscore the role of trust-based leadership in fostering sustainable organizational outcomes. Based on these insights, a practical framework was developed to integrate servant leadership principles into team-building initiatives, leadership development programs, and organizational systems.

Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is widely used to study environmental intentions and behaviours. However, how quality of life (QoL) influences these intentions and interactions among TPB’s own variables within a single research framework has not been thoroughly explored. Therefore, this study extends TPB by incorporating the four dimensions of QoL, as measured by the Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, and Pleasure (CASP-19) scale, to understand pro-environmental intentions from Malaysian viewpoints. In this study, quantitative approach was applied, and the data were collected from Malaysians aged 18 and above (N = 182) in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), a two-step approach was employed to assess the measurement and structural models. The findings confirmed Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) is a robust model for environmental studies showing that subjective norm and perceived behavioural control significantly influence attitudes toward pro-environmental behaviour, ultimately leading to pro-environmental intention. Interestingly, this study found no relationship between QoL dimensions and pro-environmental intention. Lastly, both theoretical and managerial implications were discussed, and research limitations and suggestions for future research directions were put forward.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8953","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.348110","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Booi Chen Tan","raw_content_length":1582,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Planned Behaviour","Quality of Life Influence Pro","the Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation","TPB"],"persons":[],"locations":["Malaysia","Klang Valley","QoL"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1572,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Life","light","global environmental deterioration","studies","pro-environmental intention","behaviour","the ultimate goal","factors"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Life":2.0,"light":1.0,"global environmental deterioration":1.0,"studies":1.0,"pro-environmental intention":1.0,"behaviour":1.0,"the ultimate goal":1.0,"factors":1.0}},"age_hours":18.736923273888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8373,"joy":0.0101,"surprise":0.0217,"sadness":0.0158,"fear":0.0293,"anger":0.0296,"disgust":0.0561},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.55,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Investigating the influence of cultural factors on pro-environmental behavior in the Netherlands.","Exploring the relationship between quality of life and energy consumption patterns in Dutch households."],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Could be used as a case study in social science aspects of energy transition.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study investigates the influence of quality of life on pro-environmental intentions in Malaysia, finding no direct correlation.

This article analyzes this shift by examining two regulatory approaches: voluntary instruments such as the OECD-FAO Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains and binding EU directives like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Using a qualitative and interpretive methodology, the study combines a literature review and two case studies (Nicoverde and Lavazza) to explore the evolution from soft law to hard law and the synergies and analyze how these tools are applied in the Italian agri-food sector and how they can contribute to improving corporate sustainability performance. Findings show that soft law has paved the way for more rigorous regulation, but the increasing compliance burden poses challenges, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These cases serve as virtuous examples to illustrate how soft and hard law interact in practice, offering concrete insights into the translation of general sustainability principles into corporate strategies. A hybrid governance framework—combining voluntary and binding tools—can foster sustainability if supported by coherent policies, stakeholder collaboration and adequate support mechanisms. The study offers practical insights for both companies and policymakers navigating the evolving legal scenario.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8952","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.348421","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Debora Scarpato","raw_content_length":1544,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive","CSDDD","Nicoverde","OECD","the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive"],"persons":["Supply Chains","Sustainable Challenges"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1524,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Soft Law","Hard Law","Legal Transitions","Sustainable Challenges","the Italian Agri","The transition","hard law","global agri-food governance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Soft Law":2.0,"Hard Law":2.0,"Legal Transitions":2.0,"Sustainable Challenges":2.0,"the Italian Agri":2.0,"The transition":1.0,"hard law":1.0,"global agri-food governance":1.0}},"age_hours":18.736939707222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8684,"joy":0.0213,"surprise":0.0193,"sadness":0.0072,"fear":0.0337,"anger":0.0278,"disgust":0.0223},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":7,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":7,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":6,"applied_research_fit":6,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":6.7,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":true,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":true},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Nicoverde","country":"Italy","role":"Agri-food company"},{"name":"Lavazza","country":"Italy","role":"Agri-food company"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[{"name":"EU directives like the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)","country":"EU","funding_type":"regulatory"}],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of CSDDD and CSRD on Italian agri-food SMEs","Hybrid governance frameworks for sustainability in agriculture","Stakeholder collaboration in implementing sustainable agri-food practices"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Case studies on Nicoverde and Lavazza can be integrated into courses on sustainable business practices and EU environmental policy.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article analyzes the transition from voluntary sustainability guidelines to binding EU directives (CSDDD, CSRD) in the Italian agri-food sector, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for SMEs.

The research was carried out on a real waste solution, containing low concentrations of platinum group metals and significant amounts of base metals such as copper, iron, chromium, and nickel. It was found that a 20% solution of Mextral 63H in toluene selectively extracts over 99% of Pd, while a 10% solution of trioctylamine effectively extracts both Pd and Pt with a yield of over 98%. Effective stripping agents were also selected for the obtained Pd and Pt extracts: 2 M thiourea solution for Pd and diluted solutions of nitric and perchloric acids for Pt. The research allowed the development of a technological scheme enabling the separation of all three platinum group metals by selective extraction of Pd and then Pt, while Rh remains in the raffinate after both extraction stages. The proposed model, developed on the basis of results obtained for a real solution, assumes selective recovery of palladium, platinum, and rhodium from such solutions, which can find application in the precious metals industry.

The aim was to explore sustainable alternatives to synthetic fertilizers in line with organic agriculture principles. The region’s designation as the Quarta Colônia UNESCO Global Geopark reinforces the relevance of this initiative. The research involved petrographic characterization, incubation experiments, and chemical analyses of rhyolite samples. Incubation tests with pigeon pea and elephant grass assessed combinations of rock filler and poultry litter. The results showed that rhyolite filler supported plant growth, especially with poultry litter, which supplies nitrogen and microorganisms that accelerate mineral weathering. Petrographic observations indicated that elephant grass promoted stronger mineral alteration, likely due to its dense fibrous roots and substrate interaction. Chemical analyses confirmed the rhyolite’s quartz content and trace elements remain within safety limits defined by Brazilian legislation on soil remineralizers. The K2O content and the base sum (CaO, MgO, and K2O) also complied with minimum legal requirements. Beyond mineralogical and chemical aspects, the study emphasized the economic feasibility of using locally sourced rock fillers, offering lower costs than synthetic fertilizers and supporting sustainable, resilient agroecological systems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8955","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.349041","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Augusto Nobre","raw_content_length":1556,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quarta Colônia de Imigração Italiana","the Potential Use of Rhyolite Filler","the Quarta Colônia UNESCO Global Geopark"],"persons":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1494,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Fourth Colony","Italian Immigration","Rio Grande","Sul","Brazil","Sustainability","Pages","Assessments","the Potential Use","Rhyolite Filler"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Fourth Colony":3.0,"Italian Immigration":3.0,"Rio Grande":3.0,"Sul":3.0,"Brazil":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Assessments":2.0,"the Potential Use":2.0,"Rhyolite Filler":2.0}},"age_hours":18.736973823055557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7834,"joy":0.0352,"surprise":0.0201,"sadness":0.0152,"fear":0.0194,"anger":0.0455,"disgust":0.0813},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":8,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.95,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":true},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Soil remineralization using local rock fillers","Impact of different plant species on mineral weathering","Economic feasibility of rock fillers in agriculture"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Examples of sustainable agriculture practices and alternative fertilizer use.","hands_on_opportunities":"Potentially setting up small-scale incubation experiments to test different rock fillers."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The study explores the use of rhyolite filler as a soil remineralizer in Brazil, offering a sustainable alternative to synthetic fertilizers.

A multi-stage dynamic game model is developed, in which the manufacturer reduces emissions through recycling efforts and investments in green technology. We compare optimal decisions under centralized, decentralized, and coordinated structures, and propose an enhanced bilateral cost-sharing contract to improve collaboration. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, and sensitivity analyses provide further insights. The results show that while both carbon tax and permit trading increase emission reduction, the carbon tax may lower manufacturer profit, underscoring the need for coordinated policy design. Benchmarking proves more effective than grandfathering in stimulating green investment, particularly under high carbon prices and strong consumer environmental preferences. The proposed contract alleviates free riding, enhances overall supply chain profitability, and improves emission reduction performance. Policy implications highlight the importance of prioritizing benchmark allocation, promoting consumer environmental awareness, and encouraging firms to integrate carbon asset management with technological innovation.

This study examines consumer perceptions of certified mountain products in Romania, with a specific focus on cow’s milk. A structured survey was conducted among 576 respondents from the Bucharest–Ilfov metropolitan area, representing the target population of regular food consumers. The data were analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistical methods in SPSS, including chi-square tests and contingency coefficients, to evaluate consumer awareness, attitudes, and their willingness to pay. The results reveal that although awareness of the “mountain product” label is high (88.9%), its direct influence on purchase decisions remains limited, with price, brand, and origin playing stronger roles. Nevertheless, 95% of respondents expressed willingness to pay a premium price, and over 70% associated mountain certification with health benefits and higher quality. These findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of certification as a market-based tool to support sustainable consumption and the economic resilience of mountain areas. The study contributes empirical evidence from a less explored national context. It offers insights for policymakers, producers, and retailers seeking to strengthen short food supply chains and consumer trust in certified labels.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8950","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:24.349805","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Marian Butu","raw_content_length":1467,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SPSS","Certified Mountain Products","Consumer Attitudes, Awareness","Purchase Behaviour"],"persons":[],"locations":["Bucharest","Romania","Romania Interest"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1427,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Romania","Sustainability","Pages","Consumer Attitudes","Awareness","Purchase Behaviour","Certified Mountain Products","Interest","consumer behavior","agri-food products"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Romania":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Consumer Attitudes":2.0,"Awareness":2.0,"Purchase Behaviour":2.0,"Certified Mountain Products":2.0,"Interest":1.0,"consumer behavior":1.0,"agri-food products":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73700550638889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8626,"joy":0.0405,"surprise":0.019,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.0195,"disgust":0.0445},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.95,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Consumer behavior analysis for sustainable food products","Impact of certification labels on consumer purchase decisions","Strategies to enhance consumer trust in certified products"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Examples of consumer behavior studies related to sustainable products can be integrated into marketing and sustainability courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Students can conduct surveys and analyze consumer data related to sustainable products."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study examines consumer perceptions of certified mountain products in Romania, focusing on cow's milk.

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_314b40e92ec0","title":"Empowering Women in the Power Industry","content":"Without support from her family, Mini Thomas says, she would not have had a successful career in academia.The IEEE senior member has held several leadership positions in India, including dean of engineering at the Delhi Technological University (formerly the Delhi College of Engineering) and (the first female) president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli. Today she is a professor of electrical engineering at Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, where she formerly was a dean.Mini ThomasEmployer: Jamia Millia Islamia, in New DelhiTitle: Professor of electrical engineeringMember grade: Senior memberAlma maters: University of Kerala; the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras; the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.Thomas, an expert in power systems and smart grids, is working to get more women into the power and energy industry.She is an active IEEE volunteer, having worked with student branches and membership recruitment. As a member of the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization, she shares her knowledge about energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and ozone-layer recovery.“For a woman to succeed, she needs a lot of family support,” Thomas says, because many women’s careers are interrupted by caretaking and child-rearing responsibilities. She acknowledges that not all women have the same support system she has—which is part of the reason why she is dedicated to helping others succeed.A passion for teachingThomas was born and raised in Kerala, India. Kerala students who excelled at school were expected to choose a career in either medicine or engineering, she says. Medicine wasn’t an option for her, she says, because she faints at the sight of blood. She was good at mathematics, though, so she chose to pursue engineering.Although both her parents were teachers (her father taught chemistry; her mother was a language instructor), she wasn’t inspired to pursue a similar path until she was an undergraduate at the University of Kerala. Her extensive note-taking during class made her popular among her classmates, she says, and some would ask her to tutor them during exam season.“My friends would come over to my home so I could explain the material to them using my notes,” she says. “Afterward, they would tell me that they were able to understand the subject much better than how the professor had explained it. That’s what inspired me to become a teacher.”After earning her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1984, Thomas continued her education at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Shortly after earning her master’s of technology in electrical engineering in 1986, she began her first teaching job at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut, also in Kerala.The year was a whirlwind for Thomas, who got married, left her job, and moved to New Delhi, where her husband lived. Instead of searching for another teaching job, she decided to pursue a doctoral degree in the electrical engineering program at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.“By the time I was 28, I had a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which I earned in 1990,” she says. “I soon got a job at Delhi Technological University, the only other college in New Delhi that had an engineering school at that time, other than IIT. From there, I never looked back.”She taught at the university for five years, then left in 1995 to join Jamia Millia Islamia. She eventually was promoted to lead the electrical engineering department.During her 11 years there, she established labs to conduct research in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and substation automation, collaborating with industry on projects. In 2003 she created a curriculum for—and led the launch of—a master’s of technology program in electrical power system management as well as a training program for industry professionals. For her work, she received a 2015 IEEE Educational Activities Board Meritorious Achievement Award.In 2014 she founded the school’s Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to help startups turn their ideas into prototypes and launch businesses.She received an offer she couldn’t refuse in 2016: become president of the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli.“This was a great honor to become the first woman president of that institute,” she says. “I was the only woman among 90 presidents of all the institutions of national importance at that time.”But, she says, as president, she didn’t have much time to teach, and after five years, she began to miss her time in the classroom. After her five-year term was completed, she returned to Jamia Millia Islamia in 2021 as engineering dean. Since then, she has led the launch of five programs: three undergraduate programs (in data science, electrical and computer engineering, and VLSI) and graduate programs in data science and environmental sciences.This year she stepped down after completing her three-year term as dean and is focusing more on teaching.She teaches at least one class each semester because, she says, she finds joy in “imparting and giving knowledge to young minds.”Mentoring women in the power industryThomas mentors doctoral students as well as professors who aspire to serve as deans or other high-level positions.In addition, she trains mid-career women in the power industry on the skills they need to get promoted—to technical and senior management roles—through the South Asia WePOWER network’s South Asia Region (SAR) 100 professional development program. WePOWER is a coalition of nonprofit and government organizations that aim to increase the number of women working in the power and energy sectors through education. A 2020 World Bank study found that the percentage of women in technical roles in the industry in South Asia ranges from 0.1 to 21.The six-month-long program provides technical training, mentorship, and networking opportunities to 100 women from Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Thomas is one of 40 experts who remotely teach topics such as transmission details, distribution, renewable energy, and the importance of women in leadership.She also mentors women to give them confidence and tools to reach leadership positions because “mentorship is what changed my career trajectory,” she says. When she first began teaching, she says she was reluctant to take high-level positions. But after participating in a six-day leadership training at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, which was hosted by the Government of India’s University Grants Commission, she felt confident in her ability to move up the career ladder.“Many women take a break from their careers to raise their children, struggle to balance their personal and professional lives, or don’t have a support system,” she says. “I want to impart the lessons I learned from my experiences and the training I received. Whenever I get a chance, I get involved.”Creating lifelong friendships and mentoring studentsThomas joined IEEE in 1990 as a graduate student member and says she continues renewing her membership to stay up to date on emerging technologies, specifically SCADA systems.“I learned everything about SCADA from a tutorial developed by the IEEE Power & Energy Society. There was no such material available at that time,” she says.Years later, in 2015, Thomas cowrote Power System SCADA and Smart Grids with her friend John McDonald, whom she met through the organization. McDonald is an IEEE Life Fellow and the founder and CEO of JDM Associates in Duluth, Ga.Thomas became an active volunteer for the Delhi Technological University’s student branch, where she helped organize technical talks and other events. When Thomas joined Jamia Millia Islamia, she revived the inactive student branch there and served as its counselor for 14 years.During her 35 years with IEEE, she has served as chair of the Region 10 student activities committee and vice chair of membership development for IEEE Member and Geographic Activities. She was a member of the IEEE Educational Activities and the IEEE Publication Services and Products boards.“Creating programs that benefit members makes me feel satisfied,” Thomas says. “Volunteering has also boosted my confidence.”She is also a member of IEEE Spectrum’s editorial advisory board.Not only does she attribute much of her professional growth to the organization, she also has created lifelong friendships through IEEE, she says. One friend is 2023 IEEE President Saifur Rahman, whom she met in 2000 when he spoke to the Jamia Millia Islamia student branch.“Our friendship has grown so much that Saifur is like family,” she says.When Rahman launched the IEEE Technology for a Sustainable Climate Matrix Organization in 2022, he asked Thomas to become a member. She helped create the IEEE Climate Change Collection on the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The following year, she led the development of a climate change taxonomy. The 620 words are included in the IEEE Thesaurus, which defines almost 12,500 engineering, technical, and scientific terms. Now she is working with a team to expand the taxonomy by defining hundreds more climate-change terms.“You should always do what you enjoy. For me, that’s teaching and volunteering with IEEE,” she says. “I could just be a member, access the technical content, and be happy with just that, but I volunteer because I can do things that help others.”","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/empowering-women-power-industry","published_date":"2025-10-09T18:00:04","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:26.161065","language":"en","tags":["engineering","typeti","ieee_member_news","mentoring","scada","ieee","technology","industry","ieee_student_members","women_engineering"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE Spectrum","source_category":"science","word_count":1472,"author":"Joanna Goodrich","raw_content_length":13365,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":7.36,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Jamia Millia Islamia University","IEEE","the National Institute of Technology","the Indian Institute of Technology","the Delhi College of Engineering","the Delhi Technological University","the Power Industry Without","University of Kerala"],"persons":["Thomas","Madras","Mini ThomasEmployer","Mini Thomas","Tiruchirappalli"],"locations":["India","New Delhi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":9447,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["she","Women","the Power Industry","support","her family","Mini Thomas","a successful career","academia","The IEEE senior member","several leadership positions"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["academia"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"she":3.0,"Women":2.0,"the Power Industry":2.0,"support":1.0,"her family":1.0,"Mini Thomas":1.0,"a successful career":1.0,"academia":1.0,"The IEEE senior member":1.0,"several leadership positions":1.0}},"age_hours":0.7368205652777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.849499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3699,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3951,"joy":0.2409,"surprise":0.0215,"sadness":0.2851,"fear":0.0173,"anger":0.0148,"disgust":0.0252},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":9,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Delhi Technological University","country":"India","collaboration_type":"education"},{"name":"National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli","country":"India","collaboration_type":"education"},{"name":"Jamia Millia Islamia University","country":"India","collaboration_type":"education"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","country":"India","collaboration_type":"education"},{"name":"Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi","country":"India","collaboration_type":"education"},{"name":"National Institute of Technology, Calicut","country":"India","collaboration_type":"education"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Strategies for promoting women in STEM fields","Impact of mentorship programs on career advancement for women engineers","Analysis of family support systems and their role in women's career trajectories in engineering"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Incorporate case studies of successful women engineers into the curriculum.","hands_on_opportunities":"Organize workshops and seminars featuring women engineers as speakers and mentors."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article highlights the importance of supporting women in the power and energy industry, focusing on the career of Mini Thomas and her work with IEEE.

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_dd7efa19d4d5","title":"Cisco Bridges Classical and Quantum Networks","content":"In the drive to make a practical quantum computer, researchers are developing bigger and better quantum networks—ones with capabilities that will complement and enhance quantum computing. Put another way, building a functioning quantum network that can exchange many qubits securely, over long distances, could be a useful end goal completely apart from the quantum computer race.In that vein, Cisco launched a quantum networking software system on 25 September. The networking giant’s technology could help to bring about more powerful quantum sensors, secure position verification, and quantum-enhanced imaging tech—to list just three of a range of emerging, non-computing applications for quantum networks.The team has a hybrid purpose in mind as well, says Ramana Kompella, vice president and head of research at Cisco in San Jose, Calif.: Quantum networks that can work with classical computers and conventional computer networks.“This is a very fascinating field for us because until now classical computing didn’t have access to a quantum network,” Kompella says. “But imagine if you had access to a quantum network, what can you actually enable in terms of new capabilities?” Kompella has an answer to his own question. “We can secure classical networking with the help of quantum signals by detecting eavesdroppers on long-distance fiber optic communications,” he says.How Does Quantum Entanglement Secure Networks?To do so, Kompella says, the system relies on the fact that quantum signals shared across their sensitive network are connected together via quantum entanglement. “We inject entangled photons into the optical fiber,” he says. “And if the attacker tries to tap the fiber, they end up disturbing the entanglement, which allows us to detect them.”Kompella adds that entanglement exchanged over network distances has other classical computing applications in high-frequency trading and fintech, “as well as maybe you can drive ultra-precise time synchronization with the help of entanglement-based networks,” he says.Cisco’s quantum networking system is built on top of a practical quantum networking chip the company introduced in May, which uses existing fiber optic lines, generates up to 200 million entangled photon pairs per second, and operates at standard telecom wavelengths.But the new component Cisco recently introduced is software. The compiler the company has now launched enables a coder to write in IBM’s Python-based Qiskit quantum computer language. And the Cisco compiler takes care of technical networking details like optimizing the connections between quantum processors and fine-tuning error correction strategies.“We hide the physical layer complexity,” says Reza Nejabati, Cisco’s head of quantum research. “Which allows the algorithm developers to play with the number of processors and how the processors are connected together to optimize their algorithms.”“The compiler takes that high-level goal, breaks it up, and then drives the networking side of the equation,” Kompella adds.Hoi-Kwong Lo, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Toronto in Canada, says that Cisco is championing an under-appreciated portion of the larger quantum technology world.“Investment is a key issue,” Lo says. “While there have been billions of research funding annually invested in quantum computing start-ups, investments in quantum networking start-ups have been falling behind.”According to Ronald Hanson, a professor of nanoscience at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, Cisco’s work is a key next step. But it’s only a next step.“What Cisco is presenting now is not really first of its kind,” Hanson says. “But the fact that Cisco is working on several of these different elements of the quantum network combined with their classical networking expertise and strengths makes the progress interesting and will push the quantum networking industry as a whole.”What Will It Take for Quantum Networks to Scale?The biggest limitation on Cisco’s system at present, says Nejabati, is the physical distance limit that a single photon can travel before being absorbed by the optical fiber itself.“Our hardware and software technology allows us to … go up to a hundred kilometers with a very high quality, high performance network,” Nejabati says.Lo says physics—in particular a law called the “no-cloning theorem,” stating that individual quantum bits can never be perfectly replicated—makes large-scale quantum networks especially tricky to realize. “The big challenge is to build quantum repeaters,” Lo says. “Optical fibers are lossy, and to overcome the distance limit, we need quantum repeaters.”Lo’s group, for one, is investigating encoding a qubit’s signal not onto another individual photon but rather onto a cluster of entangled photons. IEEE Spectrum has tracked Lo’s group’s initial work on this method in 2015 and proof-of-principle experimental test in 2019.On the other hand, says Hanson, making quantum repeaters isn’t the only way forward for next-generation quantum networking tech.“Just sharing photons is in our mind not the most interesting tech since many use cases remain out of reach,” Hanson says. “Instead, our goal is to create … entanglement on demand: by combining entanglement distribution via photonic channels with long-lived quantum memories—a buffer of entangled qubits ready to be consumed.”This way, Hanson says, quantum entanglement can be stored like energy in a battery or terabits on a hard drive, and tapped into when users on either end of the network want to share quantum information.“Buffered entanglement will unlock an interesting range of applications beyond [quantum cryptography] that have the promise to bring real value,” Hanson says. “It will be interesting to see when Cisco will make the step to that technology for their networks.”","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-networks-cisco-quantum-computing","published_date":"2025-10-09T16:00:04","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:26.163712","language":"en","tags":["hybrid_computing","engineering","industry","ieee","quantum_repeaters","quantum_networks","quantum_sensors","quantum_computers","technology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_67f7c7c305a3","title":"Learning to Code Still Matters in the Age of AI","content":"This article is crossposted from IEEE Spectrum’s careers newsletter. Sign up now to get insider tips, expert advice, and practical strategies, written in partnership with tech career development company Taro and delivered to your inbox for free!Cursor, the AI-native code editor, recently reported that it writes nearly a billion lines of code daily. That’s one billion lines of production-grade code accepted by users every single day. If we generously assume that a strong engineer writes a thousand lines of code in a day, Cursor is doing the equivalent work of a million developers. (For context, while working at Pinterest and Meta, I’d typically write less than 100 lines of code per day.)There are only about 25 million software developers worldwide! Naively, it appears that Cursor is making a meaningful percentage of coders obsolete.This begs the question: Is it even worth learning to code anymore? The answer is a resounding “yes.” The above fear-based analysis of Cursor misses several important points.First, the demand for software is insatiable. Getting a computer to follow our instructions properly (i.e., coding) is economically incredibly valuable. However, for decades now, the number of people with the specialized skill to communicate with computers has been limited. If AI tools let us write more functional code, many more people, companies, and industries will benefit. As Marc Andreesen famously alluded to in his 2011 essay “Why Software Is Eating the World,” the demand for software is elastic. As software becomes cheaper, we see a disproportionately large increase in demand. There’s no such thing as finishing a software project. Humans are very good at demanding more products and services, and software will inevitably play a role in that future.Another critical observation is that AI-assisted code is simply a continuation of the evolution of software development. In the 1970s, we used to program with punch cards. Then we started writing low-level code with a keyboard. Then we shifted to higher-level languages. Each successive era saw large increases in the number of software engineers while simultaneously improving the productivity of each person. We’ve seen this storyline before: AI is just another tool to give us superpowers.Coding tools like Cursor or Devin are less about replacing software engineers than they are about increasing the number of software engineers. Going forward, writing code won’t be restricted to those with a particular title; everyone including lawyers, accountants, and doctors will develop software. Cursor won’t replace the 25 million software engineers we have today. Instead, it will create millions more.—RahulTop Programming Languages 2025IEEE Spectrum’s annual ranking of the top programming languages is here—and it might be the last. Coders are now turning away from many of the public expressions of interest in different languages (like Google searches and Stack Exchange queries), which have served as key metrics for the ranking since 2013. What does the move toward AI coding tools mean for the future of programming and how we track the coding landscape? Read more here.How Badly Is AI Cutting Early-Career Jobs? Also in the realm of how AI is affecting programming: The Stanford Digital Economy Lab has released a report finding early evidence that employment has taken a hit for young workers in the occupations that use generative AI the most, including software engineering.

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_932c7cf0f35d","title":"The AI Boom Has a Copper Problem. Are Microbes the Solution?","content":"The internet’s next existential crisis won’t be disinformation or deepfakes. It will be copper.The world is building AI like it’s Minecraft, stacking data centers, transmission lines, and cooling systems with little regard for the physical limits beneath them. Everyone is focused on models and computation, but few acknowledge the metal that makes them run.Every piece of modern electrical infrastructure—not just AI—depends on copper. AI data centers are simply accelerating demand. One hyperscale facility can require tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. For example, one Microsoft data center used over 2,000 tonnes, or 27 tonnes per megawatt. A McKinsey report predicts that overall transmission build-out could push annual global copper demand up to about 37 million tonnes by 2031. Accessible copper is running out. More than 70 percent of global reserves are locked in ores that conventional mining struggles to process efficiently. Tens of billions of tons sit idle in waste piles and marginal deposits, overlooked by industry but still rich with potential.That potential is what drew me here. As a geoscientist who later worked in energy and cloud infrastructure, I saw firsthand the growing need for copper—and realized I had the knowledge to help address it. In 2023, I founded a startup called Endolith to recover copper from these forgotten sources. The tool is not drills or dynamite. It’s microbes.How microbial mining worksThese microbes are naturally evolved, field-deployable, and highly effective at recovering copper from complex ores such as chalcopyrite and enargite. They thrive in leaching heaps under real-world conditions, working with real customers. And the bonus: They use less energy, deliver more copper, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional methods.And what are those traditional methods? Typically, mines extract copper from ores by grinding the rock, concentrating the ore, and then using high-temperature smelting or chemical leaching with strong acids. Both approaches are energy-intensive, slow to unlock copper, and leave behind large volumes of waste and emissions. Endolith researchers use machine learning to determine which microbes to deploy at a given site and how to adjust the mix over time. Dynamic Tech Media/EndolithIn contrast, our “microbial minions” work by accelerating the natural process of bioleaching. Instead of relying on smelting or harsh acids, Endolith’s microbes attach to the ore and pull out the copper faster. They adapt to the chemistry of different rock types, recover more metal, and do it with lower energy use and less environmental impact.To make this possible, we rely on machine learning. Genomic and metabolic data from thousands of microbes are modeled to predict which strains can survive in extreme ores such as chalcopyrite or enargite, and how they will perform under different environmental conditions. These models guide which microbial communities are deployed, how they are tuned for each site, and how they adapt over time. In effect, AI is what turns biology from trial-and-error into a scalable system for copper recovery; in turn, that copper is what keeps powering the growth of AI itself. Endolith is currently running a pilot project in Arvada, Colorado.Dynamic Tech Media/EndolithOur approach has already been validated by some of the largest copper producers in the world, including BHP. Microbial recovery is cleaner. It scales. It adapts. Our modular biohatcheries—field units designed to grow and deliver tailored microbes—can be deployed in days. They can be tuned for local conditions. They make copper recovery viable on deposits that were previously left untouched. This tool opens access to a part of the supply chain that mining has overlooked and technology has rarely considered.The copper crunch is slowing down AIConversations about AI infrastructure rarely address this layer. Computing costs and energy needs dominate the narrative, yet copper underpins the entire system. Liz Dennett founded Endolith to recover much-needed copper from low-grade ore. Dynamic Tech Media/EndolithThe physical side of AI is often hidden from view. Its presence becomes obvious when a data center project is delayed because a transformer cannot be delivered on time, or when utilities cannot build transmission lines quickly enough to support new computing loads. These are copper problems, hiding in plain sight.I have had calls with site engineers who are excited about deploying cutting-edge computing, but are quietly worried about whether the wiring can handle it. Infrastructure does not automatically follow because the software is ready. Copper is bound by geology and time. Mines move slowly, recycling moves too narrowly, and demand moves too fast. Smarter biological recovery is the lever we can pull today.Skeptics note that bioleaching has historically struggled with tough ores like chalcopyrite. Processes were often slow, incomplete, or difficult to manage at scale. Recent advances in microbial science and heap engineering are closing those gaps. With AI guiding the optimization of microbes, we can now match the right strains to the right ores, showing that biology can succeed where older methods fell short.Too often, technology assumes the material world will keep pace with ambition. But ambition alone cannot dig rock from the ground—and it definitely cannot create copper. I see a disconnect between belief and infrastructure. We believe this future is coming, but the physical systems required to support it are decades behind. If we want to build something durable, we need more than ambition and venture capital. We need metal, and we need smarter pathways to extract it.If we want to keep building, we need to be clear about what we are building with. That means extraction, wiring, and chemistry—the parts of the system that rarely make headlines but determine whether progress is possible.The AI era will not be sustained by excitement. It will be sustained by copper. And the next leap in recovery may come from microbes…tiny, ancient, and alive.","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-copper","published_date":"2025-10-09T12:00:04","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:26.168140","language":"en","tags":["data_centers","engineering","copper","microbes","mining","ieee","grid","infrastructure","industry","technology"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE Spectrum","source_category":"science","word_count":938,"author":"Liz Dennett","raw_content_length":9163,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":4.69,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The AI Boom Has a Copper Problem","Are Microbes the Solution","Microsoft"],"persons":["McKinsey"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":6094,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The AI Boom","a Copper Problem","Microbes","the Solution","copper","them","The internets next existential crisis","disinformation","deepfakes","The world"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["The AI Boom"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The AI Boom":2.0,"a Copper Problem":2.0,"Microbes":2.0,"the Solution":2.0,"copper":2.0,"them":2.0,"The internets next existential crisis":1.0,"disinformation":1.0,"deepfakes":1.0,"The world":1.0}},"age_hours":6.736870848333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.742,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9352,"joy":0.0015,"surprise":0.0131,"sadness":0.0099,"fear":0.0042,"anger":0.0178,"disgust":0.0183},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":7,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":7,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":6.1,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":true,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":true},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Endolith","country":"USA","role":"Microbial copper recovery startup"},{"name":"BHP","country":"Australia","role":"Copper producer"},{"name":"Microsoft","country":"USA","role":"Data center operator"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[{"location":"Arvada, Colorado","capacity":"N/A","status":"operational"}]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Optimization of microbial bioleaching for copper recovery","Machine learning applications in bioleaching process control","Life cycle assessment of microbial copper recovery vs. traditional methods"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Integration into sustainable resource management and biotechnology courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Lab experiments on bioleaching processes, data analysis of microbial performance."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"Endolith is developing a microbial bioleaching process for copper recovery from low-grade ores and waste piles, using machine learning to optimize microbial strains.

Eguíluz Social interactions are fundamental in animal groups, including humans, and can take various forms, such as competition, cooperation, or kinship. Understanding these interactions in marine environments has been historically challenging due to data collection difficulties. However, advancements in acoustic telemetry now enable the remote analysis of such behaviors. This study proposes a method to derive leader-follower networks from presence data collected by a single acoustic receiver at a specific location. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, the method analyzes lag times between consecutive presences of individuals to infer directed relationships. Tested on simulated data, it was then applied to detection data from acoustically tagged reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) frequenting a known site. Results revealed temporal patterns, including circadian rhythms and burst-like behavior with power-law distributed time gaps between presences. The inferred leader-follower network highlighted key behavioral patterns when compared to an appropriate random null model: females followed males more often than expected, males showed stronger but fewer associations with specific females, and smaller individuals were less consistent in following others than larger ones. These findings align with ecological insights, revealing structured social interactions and providing a novel framework for studying marine animal behavior through network theory.","source":"science_plos_complex_systems","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcsy.0000073","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:46.132732","language":"en","tags":["complexity","open-access","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Complex Systems","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Víctor M.

While previous studies have shown that observers integrate visual and vestibular signals collected during movement, it remains unclear whether and how observers use visual signals collected before their movement to perceive heading direction. Here we investigate the effect of environmental motion that occurred ahead of self-motion on the perception of self-motion. Human observers sat on a motion platform, viewed visual motion stimuli, and then reported their perceived heading after the platform moved. The results reveal that environmental motion presented before the observers’ movement significantly modulates their heading perception. We account for this effect using a normative computational model that takes into account the causal relationship between visual signals generated before and during the observers’ movement. Overall, our study highlights the crucial role of environmental motion presented before self-motion in heading perception, broadening the current perspective on the computational mechanisms behind heading estimation.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013571","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:52.457369","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Oh-Sang Kwon","raw_content_length":1247,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Jongmin Moon","Liana Nafisa Saftari"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1239,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Environmental motion","self","observers","Liana Nafisa Saftari","Jongmin Moon","The ability","a moving observer","their heading direction","effective locomotion and balance control","previous studies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Environmental motion":2.0,"self":2.0,"observers":2.0,"Liana Nafisa Saftari":1.0,"Jongmin Moon":1.0,"The ability":1.0,"a moving observer":1.0,"their heading direction":1.0,"effective locomotion and balance control":1.0,"previous studies":1.0}},"age_hours":4.743894881111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9109,"joy":0.0082,"surprise":0.0201,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0266,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0174},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.7,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Liana Nafisa Saftari, Jongmin Moon, Oh-Sang Kwon","country":null,"collaboration_type":"Research"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Computational modeling of heading perception","Integration of visual and vestibular signals for self-motion","Effect of environmental motion on self-motion perception"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of human perception and control systems, relevant to autonomous vehicle design and control.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This research explores how environmental motion before self-motion affects heading perception, using a computational model.

Rojo, Alberto Muñoz, Antonio Cuadrado, Javier DeFelipe, Sten Grillner Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is implicated in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Our understanding of the operation of the basal ganglia is largely derived on data from studies conducted on mice, which are frequently used as model organisms for various clinical conditions. The striatum, the largest compartment of the basal ganglia, consists of 90–95% striatal projection neurons (SPNs). It is therefore crucial to establish if human and mouse SPNs have distinct or similar properties, as this has implications for the relevance of mouse models for understanding the human striatum. To address this, we compared the general organization of the somato-dendritic tree of SPNs, the dimensions of the dendrites, the density and size of spines (spine surface area), and ion channel subtypes in human and mouse SPNs. Our findings reveal that human SPNs are significantly larger, but otherwise the organisation of the dendritic tree (dendrogram) with an average of approximately 5 primary dendrites, is similar in both species. Additionally in both humans and mice, over 90% of the spines are located on the terminal branches of each dendrite. Human spines are somewhat larger (4.3 versus 3.1 μm2) and the terminal dendrites have a uniform diameter in both humans and mice, although somewhat broader in the latter (1.0 versus 0.6 μm). The composition of ion channels is also largely conserved. These data have been used to simulate human SPNs building on our previous detailed simulation of mouse SPNs.

Mejias Behavioral variability across individuals leads to substantial performance differences during cognitive tasks, although its neuronal origin and mechanisms remain elusive. Here we use recurrent neural networks trained on a multisensory decision-making task to investigate inter-subject behavioral variability. By uniquely characterizing each network with a random synaptic-weights initialization, we observed a large variability in the level of accuracy, bias and decision speed across these networks, mimicking experimental observations in mice. Performance was generally improved when networks integrated multiple sensory modalities. Additionally, individual neurons developed modality-, choice- or mixed-selectivity, these preferences were different for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and the concrete composition of each network reflected its preferred behavioral strategy: fast networks contained more choice- and mixed-selective units, while accurate networks had relatively less choice-selective units. External modulatory signals shifted the preferred behavioral strategies of networks, suggesting an explanation for the recently observed within-session strategy alternations in mice.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013559","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:52.458280","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Jorge F.

Colebank Computational inverse problems for biomedical simulators suffer from limited data and relatively high parameter dimensionality. This often requires sensitivity analysis, where parameters of the model are ranked based on their influence on the specific quantities of interest. This is especially important for simulators used to build medical digital twins, as the amount of data is typically limited. For expensive models, such as blood flow models, emulation is employed to expedite the simulation time. Parameter ranking and fixing using sensitivity analysis are often heuristic, though, and vary with the specific application or simulator used. The present study provides an innovative solution to this problem by leveraging polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) for both multioutput global sensitivity analysis and formal parameter identifiability. For the former, we use dimension reduction to efficiently quantify time-series sensitivity of a one-dimensional pulmonary hemodynamics model. We consider both Windkessel and Structured Tree boundary conditions. We then use PCEs to construct univariate profile-likelihood confidence intervals and show how changes in experimental design improve identifiability. Our work presents a novel approach to determining parameter identifiability and leverages a common emulation strategy for enabling profile-likelihood analysis in problems governed by partial differential equations.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013553","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:52.458666","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Mitchel J.

Li, Somdatta Goswami, Qianying Cao, Vivek Oommen, Roland Assi, Jay D. Humphrey, George E. Karniadakis Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) stem from diverse mechanical and mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that can also increase the risk of dissection or rupture. There is increasing evidence that dysfunctions along the aortic mechanotransduction axis, including reduced integrity of elastic fibers and loss of cell-matrix connections, are particularly capable of causing thoracic aortopathy. Because different insults can produce distinct mechanical vulnerabilities, there is a pressing need to identify interacting factors that drive progression. In this work, we employ a finite element framework to generate synthetic TAAs arising from hundreds of heterogeneous insults that span a range of compromised elastic fiber integrity and cellular mechanosensing. From these simulations, we construct localized dilatation and distensibility maps throughout the aortic domain to serve as training data for neural network models to predict the initiating combined insult. Several candidate architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and input data formats are compared to establish a standard for handling future subject-specific information. We further quantify the predictive capability when networks are trained on geometric (dilatation) information alone, which mimics current clinical guidelines, versus training on both geometric and mechanical (distensibility) information. We show that prediction errors based on dilatation data are significantly higher than those based on dilatation and distensibility across all networks considered, highlighting the benefit of obtaining local distensibility measures in TAA assessment. Additionally, we identify UNet as the best-performing architecture across all training data formats. These findings demonstrate the importance of obtaining full-field measurements of both dilatation and distensibility in the aneurysmal aorta to identify the mechanobiological insults that drive disease progression, which will advance personalized treatment strategies that target the underlying pathologic mechanisms.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013550","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:52.459108","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":293,"author":"George E.

Signe White, Mike Boots Superspreading, where a small proportion of a population can cause a high proportion of infection transmission, is well known to be important to the epidemiology of a wide range of pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. However, despite its ubiquity in important human and animal pathogens, the impact of superspreading on the evolution of pathogen virulence is not well understood. Using theory and both deterministic and stochastic simulations we examine the evolution of pathogen virulence under a range of different distributions of infection transmission for the host. Importantly, for many pathogens, superpreader events may be associated with increased tolerance to infection or asymptomatic infection and when we account for this superspreading selects for higher virulence. In contrast, in animal populations where highly connected individuals, that are linked to superspreader events, also have fitness benefits, superspreading may select for milder pathogens. In isolation, the transmission distribution of the host does not impact selection for pathogen virulence. However, superspreading reduces the rate of pathogen evolution and generates considerable variation in pathogen virulence. Therefore, the adaptation of an emerging infectious disease, that exhibits superspreading, is likely to be slowed and characterised by the maintenance of maladaptive variants.

Kuhn, Dhiman Sankar Pal, Yu Deng, Tatsat Banerjee, Peter N. Devreotes, Pablo A. Iglesias In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, cell motility is regulated through a signal transduction excitable network that interfaces with the cytoskeleton to control actin polymerization patterns. In turn, the cytoskeleton influences the signaling machinery via several feedback loops, but the nature and function of this feedback remain poorly understood. In this study, we use computational models to discern the essential role of complementary positive and negative feedback loops in polarizing cells. We contrast two potential mechanisms for the negative feedback: local inhibition and global inhibition. Our results indicate that both mechanisms can stabilize the leading edge and inhibit actin polymerization in other sites, preventing multipolarity. While some experimental perturbations align more closely with the local inhibition model, statistical analyses reveal its limited polarization potential within a wide excitability range. Conversely, global inhibition more effectively suppresses secondary and tertiary leading-edge formation, making it a more robust polarization mechanism. This raises an intriguing question: if local inhibition better replicates experimental observations but is less effective for polarization than local excitation and global inhibition, could there be a supplementary mechanism enhancing its polarization potential? To address this, we propose a novel mechanism involving the dynamic partitioning of back molecules which enhances communication between the front and back of the cell and can be leveraged by local feedback interactions between the cytoskeleton and signal transduction to improve polarization efficiency.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013036","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:52.459952","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Pablo A.

However, the level of electoral integrity has sparked post-electoral violence in several African countries. Furthermore, the rise of military regimes in West Africa has interrupted the democratic process in some countries. To contribute to understanding democratization, this article explores the impact of the rule of law, electoral pluralism, and political rights on free and fair elections from 2006–2023. The study used the ordinary least squares regression and wavelet quantile on quantile granger causality to examine the predictive power of the rule of law, electoral pluralism, and political rights on free and fair elections to measure electoral integrity. The results show that the three variables predict free and fair elections at different levels. The rule of law was significant at all lower levels of free and fair elections; the rule of law and electoral pluralism were both significant at moderate and higher levels. Hence, African countries with poor electoral process democracies should establish more mechanisms towards the rule of law, and a moderate level of electoral integrity should enhance the established mechanisms.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334505","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.578523","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Dilek Latif","raw_content_length":1264,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dilek Latif Regular"],"persons":["Michael Oluchi Ikoko"],"locations":["Africa","West Africa"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1256,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["electoral integrity","Africa","Analysis","factors","Michael Oluchi Ikoko","Dilek Latif Regular elections","increasing democratization","the level","post-electoral violence","several African countries"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["Analysis"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"electoral integrity":3.0,"Africa":3.0,"Analysis":2.0,"factors":2.0,"Michael Oluchi Ikoko":1.0,"Dilek Latif Regular elections":1.0,"increasing democratization":1.0,"the level":1.0,"post-electoral violence":1.0,"several African countries":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744078118333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0473,"joy":0.0025,"surprise":0.0042,"sadness":0.0096,"fear":0.0857,"anger":0.8213,"disgust":0.0294},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.95,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of rule of law impact on energy policy implementation in African countries","Comparative study of electoral pluralism and renewable energy adoption rates in Africa","Impact of political rights on energy access and affordability in developing nations"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Potential case study for political and economic factors influencing energy transitions.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article analyzes the impact of rule of law, electoral pluralism, and political rights on free and fair elections in Africa.

Among these lncRNAs, small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) has emerged as a key regulator in multiple cellular processes. Its dysregulation is frequently implicated in disease pathogenesis, particularly cancer. In this investigation, we delineated the functional landscape and mechanistic basis of SNHG15 in lung carcinoma. Cell cycle synchronization experiments demonstrated phase-dependent SNHG15 expression, showing maximal transcript abundance during G2/M transition. SNHG15 knockdown substantially curbed tumor growth in vitro (A549 cell line) and in vivo (subcutaneous PDX models). Notably, SNHG15 orchestrated genomic surveillance mechanisms through tripartite regulation: (1) cell cycle checkpoint coordination, (2) transcriptional machinery reactivation, and (3) nucleotide excision repair. Mechanistically, proteomic profiling coupled with RNA immunoprecipitation identified CREB5 as a direct binding partner mediating SNHG15-dependent survival signaling under genotoxic stress. These results position the SNHG15-CREB5 axis as an important player governing genomic fidelity in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting druggable targets for precision oncology approaches.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334414","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.579169","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Yuming Wang","raw_content_length":1477,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Meiqi Yang","Zixuan Fan","Xin Zhang","Yuming Wang Aberrant","Jiahui Lin","Qing Lu","Sai Zhang","Tingting Zhu"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1420,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The role","lncRNA SNHG15","Xin Zhang","Jiahui Lin","Zixuan Fan","Sai Zhang","Meiqi Yang","Tingting Zhu","Qing Lu","Yuming Wang Aberrant expression"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sai Zhang"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The role":2.0,"lncRNA SNHG15":2.0,"Xin Zhang":1.0,"Jiahui Lin":1.0,"Zixuan Fan":1.0,"Sai Zhang":1.0,"Meiqi Yang":1.0,"Tingting Zhu":1.0,"Qing Lu":1.0,"Yuming Wang Aberrant expression":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7440941486111115,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.9649999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.807,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7536,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0287,"sadness":0.0333,"fear":0.0758,"anger":0.0316,"disgust":0.0721},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":2,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.7,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Investigating the role of SNHG15 in other cancer types.","Analyzing the interaction between SNHG15 and CREB5 in different cellular contexts.","Exploring potential therapeutic interventions targeting the SNHG15-CREB5 axis."],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of gene regulation in cancer development, relevant to molecular biology and potentially biomedical engineering.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article details the role of lncRNA SNHG15 in lung carcinoma, identifying a potential druggable target (SNHG15-CREB5 axis) for precision oncology.
