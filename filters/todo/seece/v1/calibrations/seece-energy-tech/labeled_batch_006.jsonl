{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2a0d31c3d83c","title":"U-Bench: A Comprehensive Understanding of U","content":"arXiv:2510.07041v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric, U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary, U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_67373a9d7e7e","title":"Crisistop voor de autoindustrie, Duitsland zoekt weg uit malaise","content":"Duitse autofabrikanten en hun toeleveranciers, nog altijd de belangrijkste industrietak van het land, hebben het zwaar. En dat drukt de stemming in het land. Om hoop te bieden houdt bondskanselier Merz vandaag een crisistop in het Kanzleramt. Daar klinkt opnieuw de roep van de Duitse autolobby om de Europese afspraken over het inperken van de CO2-uitstoot te versoepelen. Juist op dat punt heeft de regering van Merz geen duidelijk antwoord. Industrie glijdt weg Om te zien hoe slecht het gaat met Duitse autobedrijven, volstaat een greep uit het nieuws. Bij VW, BMW en Mercedes-Benz stortte de winst in. In een jaar tijd zijn 51.500 banen verdwenen in de auto-industrie. Volgens economisch instituut IW staan de komende vijf jaar nog eens 90.000 banen op de tocht. Zo maakte 's werelds grootste autotoeleverancier Bosch onlangs bekend 13.000 banen in Duitsland te schrappen. Een groot probleem is dat de Duitse auto-industrie het sterk van de export moeten hebben, en juist daar kampt met toenemende concurrentie uit China toeneemt en hoge Amerikaanse handelstarieven. Europees akkoord Een manier om bedrijven meer lucht te geven, is volgens de industrie om Europese klimaatafspraken te versoepelen. In een gezamenlijke verklaring noemen de Duitse autobelangenvereniging en vakbond de klimaatdoelen in feite onhaalbaar. Duitsland heeft er enkele jaren geleden in Brussel zelf mee ingestemd dat er vanaf 2035 in Europa geen nieuwe auto's meer verkocht mogen worden die CO2 uitstoten. Dat moet helpen om in 2050 klimaatneutraal te zijn, een doel dat Duitsland onderschrijft. Fabrikanten die niet aan de uitstooteisen voldoen moeten boetes betalen. De Duitse instemming was toen al niet van harte. Op het laatste moment ging Duitsland bij de stemming alsnog dwarsliggen om een uitzondering voor 'e-fuels' te bedingen, wat tot irritatie leidde bij andere lidstaten. Aus of niet aus Nu komt er opnieuw verzet uit Duitsland. Merz wil zich in Brussel inzetten om het verbod van tafel te krijgen: een Aus vom Verbrenner-Aus. Maandag ontving de Europese Commissie een brief met een oproep tot een \"onmiddellijke koerswissel voor de auto-industrie\", ondertekend door de Italiaanse minister van Industrie en de Duitse minister van Economische Zaken, een CDU-partijgenoot van Merz. Die brief was een verrassing voor regeringspartner SPD, waarvan de partijtop aan het Europees verbod wil vasthouden. Eveneens op maandag stelde de SPD-minister voor Milieu duidelijk dat het verbod moet blijven. \"De Duitse economische zwakte is, ook in de auto-industrie, niet veroorzaakt door te veel klimaatbescherming\", stelde minister Schneider. \"Integendeel: elektrisch rijden is de toekomst, en daar richt ook de industrie zich op. Om die omslag te maken zijn planningszekerheid nodig, en betrouwbare wettelijke voorwaarden.\" 'Geen stellingname' Een gezamenlijk regeringsstandpunt over het Europees verbod bleef voor de crisistop van Merz uit. Op een persconferentie voorafgaand aan de bijeenkomst liet hij vooral weten op te staan voor wensen van de industrie. \"We presenteren geen kant-en-klare politieke stellingname, we willen met de auto-industrie praten om te horen wat we moeten doen om uit de zware crisis in Duitsland te komen\", zei Merz. \"Wat is daarvoor aan nationale en Europese wetgeving nodig?\" Wat de bondskanselier meer kan doen dan een luisterend oor bieden blijft onduidelijk, want Europese wetgeving heeft hij uiteraard niet zelf in de hand. En dus kwam zijn regering vandaag eerst met hulpmaatregelen voor de binnenlandse markt die elektrisch rijden aantrekkelijker moeten maken. Minder dan een op de vijf nieuwe auto's die dit jaar in Duitsland verkocht zijn, is elektrisch. Daarmee lijken de eigen klimaatdoelen voorlopig onhaalbaar. Om Duitse kopers die nu nog de kat uit de boom kijken over de streep te trekken, wordt de vrijstelling van motorrijtuigenbelasting voor elektrische auto's verlengd. Daarnaast moet het voor midden- en lage inkomens aantrekkelijker worden om op uitstootvrije auto's over te stappen, hoe precies is nog niet bekend.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585852","published_date":"2025-10-09T17:50:28","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.008858","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":616,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4590,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BMW"],"persons":["Merz"],"locations":["Duitsland","Juist","Crisistop"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4046,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["de autoindustrie","malaise","het land","het","Duitse autofabrikanten","hun toeleveranciers","dat","de stemming","hoop","bondskanselier"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["malaise","dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"de autoindustrie":2.0,"malaise":2.0,"het land":2.0,"het":2.0,"Duitse autofabrikanten":1.0,"hun toeleveranciers":1.0,"dat":1.0,"de stemming":1.0,"hoop":1.0,"bondskanselier":1.0}},"age_hours":0.8670698861111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.737,"joy":0.0181,"surprise":0.1022,"sadness":0.0358,"fear":0.0375,"anger":0.0295,"disgust":0.04},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":7,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":6.45,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":true,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"VW","country":"Germany","role":"Automobile Manufacturer"},{"name":"BMW","country":"Germany","role":"Automobile Manufacturer"},{"name":"Mercedes-Benz","country":"Germany","role":"Automobile Manufacturer"},{"name":"Bosch","country":"Germany","role":"Automobile Supplier"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of policy changes on EV adoption rates","Analysis of incentives for low-income EV adoption","Comparison of German and Dutch EV incentive programs"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Case study on the German automotive industry's transition to electric vehicles and the policy challenges involved.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The German automotive industry is facing challenges in transitioning to electric vehicles due to European CO2 emission targets and increasing competition.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_3a5916c9400d","title":"Veel foto","content":"Veel fotografen en cameramensen in de journalistiek hebben tijdens hun werk weleens te maken met agressie of intimidatie. Dat heeft onderzoeksbureau Ipsos I&O onderzocht in opdracht van PersVeilig. 91 procent van de 267 fotografen en cameramensen die een vragenlijst invulden, gaf aan weleens agressie of intimidatie tijdens het werk te ervaren. Dat kan verbale agressie zijn, maar ook bedreiging, intimidatie of fysieke agressie. 78 procent maakte in het afgelopen jaar een incident mee. Omdat het totale aantal foto- en videojournalisten niet bekend is, kan dit onderzoek niet representatief worden genoemd. \"Wel hebben we ons uiterste best gedaan om alle foto- en videojournalisten te benaderen via de vakbonden en een oproepje via sociale media\", zegt onderzoeker Laurens Klein Kranenburg. \"We zochten mensen met verschillende achtergronden. We hebben een redelijk grote respons gehad op het onderzoek. Zo denken we toch een goed beeld te kunnen schetsen van het werk van foto- en videojournalisten.\" Ruim een derde van de ondervraagden (35 procent) maakt agressie of intimidatie maandelijks of zelfs vaker mee. Meer dan de helft (54 procent) heeft hier eens per jaar of minder vaak mee te maken. Toegenomen Ook heeft 52 procent het gevoel dat het aantal incidenten de laatste vijf jaar is toegenomen. En bijna acht op de tien vinden dat fotografen en cameramensen voorzichtiger zijn geworden in de afgelopen jaren. Onderzoek Ipsos I&O in opdracht van PersVeilig De vragenlijst is uitgezet bij alle 739 fotografen en cameramensen die zijn aangesloten bij de Nederlandse Vereniging van Journalisten (NVJ), de 190 mensen die lid zijn van de Nederlandse Sportpers (NSP) en de 263 politieperskaarthouders. Ook deed Ipsos I&O een oproep via sociale media. 267 mensen vulden de vragenlijst in. Er zijn acht verdiepende interviews afgenomen als aanvulling op de vragenlijst. Om de kans op 'selectieve respons' (wanneer vooral mensen met negatieve ervaringen zouden reageren) zo klein mogelijk te houden, is in de communicatie over het onderzoek benadrukt dat het voor álle fotojournalisten en cameramensen relevant was. Volgens PersVeilig is 91 procent een stuk meer dan bij eerdere, soortgelijke onderzoeken. Bijvoorbeeld in 2022, toen zij onderzoek deden naar de veiligheid van vrouwelijke journalisten. In 2021 deed Ipsos I&O ook onderzoek in opdracht van PersVeilig, een instituut dat zich inzet voor de veiligheid van journalisten. Uit dat onderzoek bleek dat meer dan acht op de tien journalisten (82 procent) weleens te maken hadden gehad met een vorm van intimidatie of bedreiging. Vooral fotojournalisten en cameramensen waren vaak doelwit. Zij vinden bijna allemaal (negen op de tien) dat bedreiging en intimidatie een gevaar zijn voor de persvrijheid. PersVeilig herkent dat beeld. \"Cameramensen en fotografen zijn de 'frontsoldaten' van de journalistiek\", zei programmamanager Peter ter Velde erover. \"Neem bijvoorbeeld 112-fotografen: zij komen als eerste aan bij incidenten waar de emoties van omstanders hoog zijn\", zei hij. De vaakst voorkomen vorm agressie en intimidatie tegen foto- en videojournalisten is verbale agressie. Driekwart van de respondenten maakte dat mee.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585850","published_date":"2025-10-09T17:34:23","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.010120","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":481,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3852,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.405,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Klein Kranenburg"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3185,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["intimidatie","Veel foto","cameramensen","Dat","procent","Veel fotografen","de journalistiek","hun werk","agressie","onderzoeksbureau"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"],"research_academic":["de journalistiek"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"intimidatie":3.0,"Veel foto":2.0,"cameramensen":2.0,"Dat":2.0,"procent":2.0,"Veel fotografen":1.0,"de journalistiek":1.0,"hun werk":1.0,"agressie":1.0,"onderzoeksbureau":1.0}},"age_hours":1.1351411338888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4724,"joy":0.0159,"surprise":0.0605,"sadness":0.0294,"fear":0.3104,"anger":0.0478,"disgust":0.0635},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.55,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Ipsos I&O","country":"Netherlands","collaboration_type":"research"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of aggression on journalist well-being","Development of safety training programs for journalists"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Societal impact of energy transitions; ethical considerations for energy professionals.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article discusses the increasing aggression and intimidation faced by photo and video journalists in the Netherlands.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_630302da30b3","title":"Matrozenpak werd haute couture: voor het eerst mode te zien in Scheepvaartmuseum","content":"Het is wat onverwacht: een modetentoonstelling in het Scheepvaartmuseum. Toch opent vandaag Oceanista - Fashion & Sea, een tentoonstelling over de invloed van de maritieme wereld op de mode. Strepen, knopen en visserstruien verschijnen immers keer op keer op catwalks, steeds in nieuwe interpretaties. In de museumzalen wordt het maritieme verleden verbonden met de hedendaagse mode. De nadruk ligt niet op historische uniformen, maar op stukken van internationale modehuizen én Nederlandse ontwerpers die zich door de zee en de scheepvaart hebben laten inspireren. Zo zijn er ontwerpen van Versace, Thom Browne en Iris van Herpen te bekijken die allemaal refereren aan het leven op of in zee. Het is de eerste keer dat in het Amsterdamse museum mode te zien is. \"We tonen in het museum altijd al hoe de scheepvaart verbonden is met de samenleving\", zegt projectleider Marloes Vreugdenhil. \"En mode heeft zo veel verbanden met het maritieme. Het voelt als een logische combinatie. We hopen dat bezoekers straks hun kledingkast in kijken en denken: 'Hé, die blauwe strepen of die gele regenjas komen voort uit de scheepvaart'.\" Denemarken Het museum nam de tentoonstelling over van het Deense M/S Maritime Museum en vulde die aan met stukken uit de eigen collectie en met bruiklenen van zowel andere musea als van ontwerpers. \"We hebben zelf niet per se een grote modecollectie. We beschikken over veel uniforms van de marine, maar hebben bijvoorbeeld geen enkele visserstrui. We moesten dus wat stappen zetten\", zegt conservator Isaäc Vogelsang. \"We hebben adviesgesprekken gehad met modeconservatoren van andere musea. Uiteindelijk hebben we meer dan de helft van de objecten in de tentoonstelling zelf toegevoegd.\" Die stukken zijn verdeeld over negen thema's, in zalen met originele aankleding. Zo zijn sommige looks tentoongesteld in uitvergrote papieren bootjes. De thema's maken duidelijk dat bepaalde inspiratiebronnen bij modeontwerpers steeds terugkomen. Neem nou de Bretonse streep. Bekend van de marinière: de klassieke trui met horizontale, wit-blauwe strepen. \"Die is ontstaan bij vissers uit Bretagne. Van daaruit zijn de strepen naar de Franse marine gegaan en andere marines namen dat snel over\", zegt Vogelsang. De Bretonse streep dook daarna op in de badmode. \"En toen kwam Chanel. Die maakte de streep populair in vrijetijdskleding voor de hogere klassen. Wat bedoeld was voor de matroos, en voor andere werklui, werd opeens ook door kunstenaars gedragen. Picasso zie je veel afgebeeld in zo'n trui, Warhol ook.\" In de jaren 80 is het ontwerper Jean Paul Gaultier die de Bretonse streep een sexy karakter geeft. \"In zijn marketingcampagnes gaat hij weer terug naar de matroos, waarmee de cirkel rond is.\" De tentoonstelling bevat naast het werk van Gaultier zelf ook een ontwerp van zijn opvolger bij het modehuis, de Nederlandse Duran Lantink, die het strepenpatroon weer op geheel eigen wijze toepast. Dubbele achtknoop Ook scheepsknopen zijn zo'n inspiratiebron. Bijvoorbeeld voor het circulaire modemerk Martan van Diek Pothoven en Douwe de Boer, waarvan twee ontwerpen zijn opgesteld. Hun Knotted Dress bestaat volledig uit dubbele achtknopen. In de scheepvaart is die knoop bedoeld om een lus in het uiteinde van een touw te leggen. \"Sinds het ontstaan van Martan in een oude scheepsloods in Durgerdam inspireren we al onze collecties op de nautische wereld. Douwe en ik zijn opgegroeid aan het water, hebben als jongetjes altijd met zeilbootjes gerommeld. Het was voor ons een no brainer om aan de tentoonstelling mee te werken\", aldus Pothoven. Oceanista heeft veel aandacht voor de beoogde duurzamere toekomst van de mode. Voor vrijwel alle Nederlandse ontwerpers die zijn opgenomen in de tentoonstelling is duurzaamheid de basis van hun werkwijze. Velen werken met afgedankte stoffen of juist met heel innovatieve materialen. Bezoekers komen bijvoorbeeld oog in oog met een jas van algen en handtasjes van vissenleer. Martan werkt met hotellinnen en oude zeilen. \"Ik hoop dat bezoekers meenemen dat de oceanen aan alle kanten vervuild worden, terwijl we er heel zuinig op moeten zijn\", zegt Pothoven. \"Het is mooi dat deze tentoonstelling niet alleen een ode aan de mode is, maar dat we ook de zee het podium geven.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585843","published_date":"2025-10-09T16:55:27","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.011410","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":668,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4524,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Scheepvaartmuseum","Amsterdamse museum mode","Thom Browne"],"persons":["Marloes Vreugdenhil","Iris van Herpen","Matrozenpak"],"locations":["Scheepvaartmuseum","Versace","haute"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4245,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["haute couture","mode","keer","een modetentoonstelling","een tentoonstelling","de invloed","de maritieme wereld","de mode","Strepen","knopen"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["mode"],"business_innovation":["mode"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"haute couture":2.0,"mode":2.0,"keer":2.0,"een modetentoonstelling":1.0,"een tentoonstelling":1.0,"de invloed":1.0,"de maritieme wereld":1.0,"de mode":1.0,"Strepen":1.0,"knopen":1.0}},"age_hours":1.7840462658333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5526,"joy":0.0258,"surprise":0.0807,"sadness":0.0285,"fear":0.1724,"anger":0.0696,"disgust":0.0704},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":4.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":true},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":["Amsterdam","Durgerdam"],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Versace","country":"Italy","role":"Fashion House"},{"name":"Thom Browne","country":"USA","role":"Fashion House"},{"name":"Iris van Herpen","country":"Netherlands","role":"Fashion Designer"},{"name":"Chanel","country":"France","role":"Fashion House"},{"name":"Jean Paul Gaultier","country":"France","role":"Fashion Designer"},{"name":"Duran Lantink","country":"Netherlands","role":"Fashion Designer"},{"name":"Martan van Diek Pothoven","country":"Netherlands","role":"Circular Fashion Brand"},{"name":"Douwe de Boer","country":"Netherlands","role":"Circular Fashion Brand"}],"research_institutions":[{"name":"M/S Maritime Museum","country":"Denmark","collaboration_type":"Exhibition Originator"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Lifecycle assessment of sustainable fashion materials","Circular design strategies for textile waste reduction"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Examples of sustainable materials and circular design can be integrated into design and engineering courses.","hands_on_opportunities":"Students could analyze the environmental impact of different fashion materials and design circular fashion solutions."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The Scheepvaartmuseum in Amsterdam is hosting an exhibition showcasing the influence of maritime themes on fashion, with a focus on sustainable designs and materials.

Hij was veroordeeld tot negen jaar cel. Dat wordt nu tien jaar cel. De Franse Gisèle Pelicot werd negen jaar lang gedrogeerd en verkracht door haar echtgenoot en tientallen andere mannen. 51 mannen werden veroordeeld tot celstraffen, variërend van 3 tot 15 jaar. De man van Pelicot kreeg twintig jaar gevangenisstraf, het maximale dat hij kon krijgen. Van de 51 veroordeelden vocht één man zijn straf aan. Maandag bepleitte hij zijn zaak opnieuw in de rechtbank en zei hij dat het nooit zijn bedoeling was geweest om haar te verkrachten en dat hij dacht dat het een spel was. Maar dat was irrelevant volgens de rechter, die verkrachting \"een kleine dood\" noemde. Hij houdt de man volledig verantwoordelijk voor zijn daden en verwijt hem dat hij weigert om die verantwoordelijkheid te nemen. Naast de hogere celstraf wordt de man onder toezicht geplaatst en moet hij vijf jaar in therapie. 'Verkrachting is verkrachting' Voor Gisèle Pelicot betekende het hoger beroep dat ze opnieuw \"een beproeving\" moest doorstaan, zoals haar advocaat zei. \"Ze is hier om uit te leggen dat verkrachting verkrachting is, en dat er niet zoiets bestaat als een 'kleine verkrachting'.\" De 72-jarige Pelicot wordt gezien als een icoon van de strijd tegen seksueel geweld. Ze stond erop dat haar zaak volledig openbaar werd behandeld en gaf haar recht op anonimiteit op om aandacht te vragen voor seksueel misbruik. Ze kreeg dit jaar de hoogste Franse onderscheiding voor haar inzet.

Het bedrijf is wereldmarktleider in de bouw van windparken op zee geworden, nadat het als eerste energiebedrijf volledig afscheid had genomen van olie en gas. Orsted raakte na een aantal zeer succesvolle beginjaren de afgelopen tijd in grote financiële problemen. Onder meer vanwege projecten in de Verenigde Staten die stuitten op weerstand van president Trump. Ook in Europa hebben de windparkbouwers het de laatste tijd moeilijk. De kosten voor de bouw van de windparken zijn met 30 tot 40 procent gestegen. Bovendien is er onzekerheid over de overgang van de industrie van gas naar elektriciteit. Die overgang bepaalt voor een groot deel de verdere groei naar de vraag van elektriciteit. Vanwege de huidige onzekerheid is de aanbesteding van een aantal nieuwe windparken in Duitsland, Denemarken en het Verenigd Koninkrijk mislukt. Nederland heeft besloten om vanaf volgend jaar de bouw van nieuwe windparken weer te gaan subsidiëren. Begin deze week deed Orsted een extra aandelenuitgifte om het eigen vermogen op te hogen. Afgelopen jaren daalde ook het aandeel op de beurs in Kopenhagen flink in waarde. Het bedrijf is voor het grootste deel eigendom van de Deense overheid en richt zich nu weer vooral op projecten in Europa en delen van Azië. Orsted streeft naar een kostenbesparing van 267 miljoen euro. Eigenaar van twee windparken voor de Zeeuwse kust In Nederland heeft Orsted de eerste grote windparken op de Noordzee aangelegd; Borssele 1 & 2 voor de Zeeuwse Kust. Het bedrijf heeft zo'n honderd medewerkers in Nederland met name voor het onderhoud van de windmolens bij Zeeland. Verder werken er nog een aantal mensen op kantoor om nieuwe projecten in Nederland binnen te halen. Het grootste deel van de 2000 ontslagen zal naar verwachting in Denemarken vallen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585834","published_date":"2025-10-09T16:03:14","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.013361","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":296,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1940,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.48,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["volge"],"persons":["president Trump"],"locations":["Duitsland","Denemarken","Nederland","Verenigde Staten","Europa","Verenigd Koninkrijk mislukt"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1852,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Deense windparkbouwer","mensen","De Deense windparkbouwer","de 8000 personeelsleden","Het bedrijf","wereldmarktleider","de bouw","windparken","zee","het"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Deense windparkbouwer":2.0,"mensen":2.0,"De Deense windparkbouwer":1.0,"de 8000 personeelsleden":1.0,"Het bedrijf":1.0,"wereldmarktleider":1.0,"de bouw":1.0,"windparken":1.0,"zee":1.0,"het":1.0}},"age_hours":2.6543706169444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6257,"joy":0.024,"surprise":0.1446,"sadness":0.0516,"fear":0.0608,"anger":0.0517,"disgust":0.0416},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":7,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":7,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":7},"seece_relevance_score":6.4,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":true,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":true},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":true,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":["Zeeland"],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Orsted","country":"Denmark","role":"Offshore wind park developer"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[{"name":"Dutch subsidies for wind park construction","country":"Netherlands","funding_type":"Subsidy"}],"deployment_sites":[{"location":"Borssele 1 & 2, Zeeland","capacity":null,"status":"operational"}]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Optimization of offshore wind farm maintenance","Impact of subsidy changes on wind energy economics"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Case study on offshore wind farm economics and policy","hands_on_opportunities":"Potential visits to Borssele wind farms for maintenance insights"},"seece_intelligence_summary":"Orsted, a leading offshore wind developer, is facing financial challenges due to rising costs and policy uncertainty, leading to job cuts.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c0e55f6b092f","title":"'Ernstige tekortkomingen' in Europese vuurwerkwet","content":"Europese vuurwerkregels voorkomen onvoldoende dat zwaar knalvuurwerk wordt gebruikt tegen eerstehulpverleners, voor plofkraken of in het criminele circuit. Dat schrijft de Europese Commissie in een evaluatie. Nederland dringt al lange tijd aan op aanpassing van de Europese vuurwerkwet. De huidige wet is twaalf jaar oud. Sinds die tijd is veel veranderd. Grote steden hebben aan de lopende band te maken met aanslagen op woningen en winkels. Het is vooral een probleem in Nederland, Frankrijk en Zweden. De Europese Commissie startte daarom een evaluatie, nadat meerdere EU-landen hadden gewezen op zwaktes in de zogeheten Pyrorichtlijn, de wet die toeziet op vrije en veilige handel in vuurwerk binnen de EU. De Commissie erkent nu zelf ook dat de wet tekortschiet. Het gaat om \"significante tekortkomingen\" op het gebied van veiligheid. \"Het is duidelijk geworden dat er blijvende gezondheids- en veiligheidsrisico's zijn\", schrijft de Commissie. Het vuurwerk brengt niet alleen de veiligheid van de mensen die het afsteken en omstanders in gevaar, maar ook die van de maatschappij als geheel, doordat criminelen het vuurwerk misbruiken. 'Vernietigende evaluatie' Het produceren van zwaar knalvuurwerk is legaal in de Europese Unie. Dat vuurwerk is alleen bedoeld voor professioneel gebruik. Toch komt het veel te vaak in verkeerde handen terecht, zegt de Commissie. Waar dat precies misgaat, is moeilijk vast te stellen omdat de huidige wetgeving niet voorziet in een goed systeem om te kunnen achterhalen waar het vuurwerk terechtkomt na de productie. Het is daarnaast te makkelijk om zonder de benodigde vergunningen het zware vuurwerk online te bestellen. Raquel García Hermida-van der Walle (D66) noemt de vuurwerkevaluatie \"vernietigend\". \"Met name als het gaat om veiligheid geeft de Commissie volmondig toe dat de huidige wetgeving tekortschiet\", zegt de Europarlementariër die eerder vragen stelde aan de Europese Commissie over het vuurwerk. \"Het vuurwerk waarmee in onze straten aanslagen worden gepleegd, rolt elders in Europa legaal uit de fabriek.\" Nederland worstelt al jaren met de gevolgen van zwaar vuurwerk en dringt aan op Europese oplossingen. Burgemeester Schouten van Rotterdam is aanvoerder van een groep bezorgde burgemeesters. Afgelopen zomer schreven ze een brief aan de Europese Commissie over de \"golf van aanvallen en incidenten\" met zware explosieven. Die komen volgens de burgemeesters vaak uit de hoek van de georganiseerde misdaad en leiden tot grote schade. Schouten noemt de conclusies van de evaluatie \"heel terecht\". \"We zien elke dag hoe makkelijk het zware vuurwerk, zoals Cobra's, verkrijgbaar is. Het wordt vervolgens gebruikt om te intimideren en om schade aan te richten.\" Volgens de burgemeester dekt het woord 'vuurwerk' in die gevallen dan ook niet de lading. \"Het zijn bommen.\" De burgemeesters pleiten in hun brief voor een Europese oplossing voor het probleem, dat in tal van EU-landen speelt. Onder de brief staan handtekeningen van burgemeesters uit Nederland, België, Zweden, Portugal, Frankrijk, Duitsland, Noorwegen en Bulgarije. Ze willen onder meer strengere wetgeving, een Europees verbod op knalvuurwerk van de zwaarste categorie en betere controles of mensen die vuurwerk kopen wel de juiste vergunningen hebben. Nederlandse lobby Naast Schouten spant ook de Nederlandse regering zich al jaren in om de vuurwerkproblemen hoog op de Europese agenda te krijgen. Dat is nog niet zo makkelijk, omdat in veel andere EU-landen de problemen met knalvuurwerk minder groot zijn. Daarnaast voelen landen waar geld wordt verdiend met de productie van zwaar vuurwerk, zoals Italië en Portugal, minder de behoefte om de wet strenger te maken. Toch heeft Nederland nu medestanders gevonden in Zweden en Frankrijk, die ook kampen met veel vuurwerkaanslagen. Begin dit jaar schreven Frankrijk en Nederland een brief aan de Commissie om de problemen met illegale handel en crimineel gebruik nogmaals aan de kaak te stellen. Volgende week organiseren Zweden, Frankrijk en Nederland een speciaal evenement in Brussel om over de vuurwerkproblemen te praten. Daar zijn ook afgevaardigden van de Europese Commissie en de Rotterdamse burgemeester Schouten bij aanwezig. De vraag is hoe snel alle inspanningen daadwerkelijk tot een aanpassing van de vuurwerkregels of zelfs een algeheel verbod op de productie van zwaar knalvuurwerk in de EU kunnen leiden. Ook wanneer er genoeg steun van andere lidstaten is voor een wetswijziging, moet eerst nog het hele wetgevingsproces worden doorlopen. De Europese Commissie laat weten momenteel te kijken hoe ze de problemen die in de evaluatie zijn vastgesteld het beste kunnen aanpakken. Een aanpassing van de vuurwerkwet, de Pyrorichtlijn, is een van de opties die wordt overwogen. Als de Europese Commissie besluit een voorstel te doen voor een wijziging van de vuurwerkregels dan zal die wijziging, eenmaal aangenomen, waarschijnlijk op zijn vroegst in 2027 in werking treden.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585833","published_date":"2025-10-09T16:00:02","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.014541","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":752,"author":null,"raw_content_length":5391,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Europese Commissie","Commissie"],"persons":[],"locations":["Nederland","Pyrorichtlijn","Frankrijk"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4960,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ernstige tekortkomingen","Europese vuurwerkwet","Europese vuurwerkregels","dat","knalvuurwerk","eerstehulpverleners","het criminele circuit","Dat","een evaluatie","lange tijd"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["dat","Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ernstige tekortkomingen":2.0,"Europese vuurwerkwet":2.0,"Europese vuurwerkregels":1.0,"dat":1.0,"knalvuurwerk":1.0,"eerstehulpverleners":1.0,"het criminele circuit":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"een evaluatie":1.0,"lange tijd":1.0}},"age_hours":2.707719951944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5639,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0397,"sadness":0.0337,"fear":0.2088,"anger":0.0699,"disgust":0.0775},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"policy","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":8,"industry_collaboration_potential":4,"educational_value":4,"applied_research_fit":2,"regional_impact_potential":7},"seece_relevance_score":5.25,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":["Rotterdam"],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[{"name":"European Commission","country":"EU","funding_type":"Regulatory"}],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of EU pyrotechnic directive enforcement","Impact of fireworks regulations on Dutch municipalities","Alternative technologies for public celebrations"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Policy analysis module in energy engineering curriculum","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The European Commission acknowledges shortcomings in the EU fireworks directive, leading to misuse by criminals and posing safety risks.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_222015b5f791","title":"Sancties tegen Rusland veroorzaken problemen bij Servische tankstations","content":"Wie in Servië wil tanken, kan bij veel benzinepompen plotseling niet meer met een pinpas of creditcard betalen. Ook is de levering van olie aan Servië gestopt. Dat is een direct gevolg van Amerikaanse sancties tegen Naftna Industrija Srbije (Olie-industrie van Servië, NIS). Reden voor de strafmaatregelen: het bedrijf is voor het grootste deel in Russische handen. Veel mensen die vanochtend hun auto hadden volgetankt, keken vreemd op toen hun bankpas aan de kassa niet werkte. De betaalautomaten bij de pompen van NIS weigeren de pinpassen en creditcards van Mastercard, Visa en American Express, omdat die Amerikaanse bedrijven geen zaken meer mogen doen met de Servische maatschappij. Betalen kan nu alleen nog met betaalkaarten van de Servische variant van Tikkie of contant. De sancties hingen NIS al sinds januari boven het hoofd, maar meerdere keren kreeg het bedrijf respijt om een oplossing te zoeken. Aandelen terugkopen Het staatsbedrijf werd in 2008 geprivatiseerd. Meer dan de helft kwam in Russische handen. Het Russische Gazprom heeft nu, direct en indirect, 55 procent van NIS in eigendom en zo'n 30 procent is nog in handen van de Servische staat. Dat is voor de Amerikanen reden om sancties op te leggen. President Vucic heeft de afgelopen maanden geprobeerd aandelen van Gazprom terug te kopen, zodat de Russen minder dan 50 procent zouden overhouden en de sancties van de baan zouden zijn. Maar dat weigerde Gazprom. De enige andere oplossing is NIS te nationaliseren, een mogelijkheid die Vucic volgens de Servische wet heeft. In feite worden de Russen dan gedwongen onteigend. Maar daar piekert Vucic niet over. \"Nationalisatie is misschien de enige uitweg, maar het is het laatste wat ik zal doen\", herhaalde Vucic vandaag. Belangrijke pijler Er staat nogal wat op het spel: de oliemaatschappij is een van de grootste en meest winstgevende bedrijven in Servië en geldt als een belangrijke pijler van de economie én de staat. NIS is eigenaar van de enige olieraffinaderij van het land, even buiten de hoofdstad Belgrado, en heeft daarnaast zo'n 330 pompstations, verreweg de meeste in het land. Er werken ruim 5000 mensen en de inkomsten dekken 12 procent van de Servische begroting. Een toekomst onder sancties ziet er allerminst rooskleurig uit. Banken trekken hun handen waarschijnlijk van NIS af omdat zij anders zelf grote schade oplopen. De Verenigde Staten verbieden immers nu iedere vorm van zakendoen met het bedrijf. Nog geen jerrycans Om dezelfde reden is Kroatië vanmorgen gestopt met het leveren van olie via de enige pijplijn die NIS bevoorraadt. NIS heeft ook benzinepompen in buurland Bosnië en Herzegovina; daar kunnen klanten vanaf vandaag alleen contant betalen. NIS verzekert nog een tijd vooruit te kunnen met de huidige voorraden. Serviërs hoeven niet met jerrycans naar de benzinepomp om te hamsteren, maar op termijn zijn tekorten en prijsstijgingen onvermijdelijk als er niks verandert. Volgens Vucic kan de raffinaderij in ieder geval tot 1 november openblijven. \"Ik hoop dat NIS geen grote aantallen mensen gaat ontslaan\", zei hij. Grootschalige import van benzine als alternatief is duur en de infrastructuur ervoor ontbreekt. Geopolitieke balanceeract De president heeft dus zelf de sleutel in handen, maar een nationalisatie zou geheid leiden tot grote ruzie met Moskou, en die wil Vucic koste wat kost voorkomen. Bijvoorbeeld omdat Servië midden in onderhandelingen met Rusland zit over de levering van goedkoop gas - iets wat Vucic op zijn buik kan schrijven als hij eerst NIS afpakt. Bovendien zou ruzie met Rusland het einde betekenen van Vucic' geopolitieke balanceeract. Vucic probeert goede banden te onderhouden met de Europese Unie, waarmee Servië onderhandelt over lidmaatschap. Tegelijkertijd staat hij behalve met China ook op goede voet met de Russische president Poetin. Servië doet daarom niet mee aan de westerse sancties die zijn ingesteld tegen Rusland na de inval in Oekraïne in 2022. Dat is Brussel een doorn in het oog. Maar Vucic de wacht aanzeggen doet de EU vooralsnog niet, uit vrees dat ze hem dan rechtstreeks in de armen van Poetin drijven. Daarom komt de druk waaronder Vucic nu komt te staan door de problemen bij NIS de EU niet slecht uit. Vucic heeft intussen de hoop niet opgegeven dat Gazprom alsnog een deel van zijn aandelen vrijwillig verkoopt. \"We gaan met de Russen praten, want met de Amerikanen valt er niets meer te bespreken.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585831","published_date":"2025-10-09T15:45:19","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.015882","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":710,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4708,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.55,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Naftna Industrija Srbije","Visa"],"persons":["American Express"],"locations":["contant","Sancties","Servië","Rusland","Mastercard"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4423,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sancties","problemen","Servische tankstations","Wie","veel benzinepompen","een pinpas","creditcard","de levering","olie","Dat"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sancties":2.0,"problemen":2.0,"Servische tankstations":2.0,"Wie":1.0,"veel benzinepompen":1.0,"een pinpas":1.0,"creditcard":1.0,"de levering":1.0,"olie":1.0,"Dat":1.0}},"age_hours":2.953013618611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8034,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0628,"sadness":0.0263,"fear":0.0334,"anger":0.0346,"disgust":0.0285},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":7,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS)","country":"Serbia","role":"Oil industry"},{"name":"Gazprom","country":"Russia","role":"Oil and gas company"},{"name":"Mastercard","country":"USA","role":"Payment processing"},{"name":"Visa","country":"USA","role":"Payment processing"},{"name":"American Express","country":"USA","role":"Payment processing"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The article discusses the impact of US sanctions on the Serbian oil company NIS, majority-owned by Russia's Gazprom.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_7d91cffcf4b7","title":"OM eist in hoger beroep levenslang voor liquidatie Peter R. de Vries","content":"Het Openbaar Ministerie eist in hoger beroep wederom levenslange gevangenisstraffen tegen de drie hoofdverdachten van de moordaanslag op misdaadjournalist Peter R. de Vries. Eerder kregen Delano G. (24) en Kamil E. (38) 28 jaar celstraf opgelegd en Krystian M. (29) ruim 26 jaar. Het OM ging in hoger beroep tegen de vonnissen van de rechtbank over de in totaal negen aangeklaagden in de moordzaak. Tegen zes mannen, onder wie hoofdverdachten G., E., en M., is vandaag dezelfde straf geëist als vorig jaar. Tegen Konrad W. (31) en Ludgardo S. (35) werden celstraffen van respectievelijk 17 en 14 jaar geëist. Christopher W. (29) kreeg weer de laagste celstraf te horen, namelijk 3 jaar. Voor drie anderen was de strafeis ditmaal lager. Gerower M. (27) en Erickson O. (29) worden beschouwd als \"voorverkenners, spotters en filmers\", zegt de advocaat-generaal (de officier van justitie in hoger beroep). Tegen hen werd eerder 21 jaar cel geëist, nu is dat 17 jaar celstraf. Tegen Divainy K. (30), die onder andere de vluchtauto regelde, wordt nu 4 jaar geëist, in tegenstelling tot de eerdere 8 jaar en 4 maanden. Uiteindelijk hebben \"alle verdachten die terechtstaan een bijdrage geleverd aan de moord, het leed van de nabestaanden en de publieke onrust\", zegt de advocaat-generaal. De rol van de verdachten Eerder schreven wij dit overzichtsartikel waarin wordt omschreven welke rol de verdachten hadden. De kinderen van De Vries, en hun moeder, maakten op zitting gebruik van hun spreekrecht. Het was de derde keer dat de zoon Royce en dochter Kelly op zitting waren. Geëmotioneerd vertelden zij over de impact van de moord op hun vader: Beide kinderen zeiden geen enkele rechterlijke uitspraak als gerechtigheid te ervaren. \"Want niets, maar dan ook niets, brengt mijn vader terug\", zei Kelly de Vries. Haar broer onderstreepte dit. \"Het recht zal altijd tekortschieten, welke straf ook wordt opgelegd\", zei hij. \"Het is nu aan u, het hof, om te bepalen welke straffen passend zijn voor deze mannen. Ik heb er vertrouwen in dat u recht zult doen\", zei Kelly de Vries. Zoon Royce sprak over de \"strijd\" die zijn vader leverde voor de rechtsstaat. \"Een strijd die hij met zijn leven heeft moeten bekopen.\" De voorzitter van het gerechtshof reageerde meelevend. \"Ik vind het heel knap hoe u dit onder woorden kunt brengen. Wat heeft die man toch veel betekend voor de rechtspraak\", zei de voorzitter, voordat hij de zitting schorste. \"Dan kan iedereen even op adem komen.\" Criminele organisatie Inmiddels is er een tiende verdachte in beeld. Raily B. (39) werd op Curaçao in de gevangenis aangehouden. Hij wordt verdacht van het hebben van een leidinggevende rol bij een criminele organisatie die onder meer achter de moordaanslag op De Vries zat. Het is nog niet duidelijk wanneer hij voor de rechter moet verschijnen. B. zou samen met de andere mannen, op Delano G. na, deelnemen aan een criminele organisatie met een Curaçaose en Poolse tak. Zij wilden volgens het OM misdrijven plegen met een terroristisch oogmerk. De organisatie wordt onder meer verdacht van het plegen een andere moordaanslag, naast de liquidatie van De Vries. Opdrachtgever onduidelijk Het staat niet vast wie de opdrachtgever is van de moordaanslag. De advocaat-generaal verwees naar de strafzaken rond de moord op de broer van Nabil B. (kroongetuige Marengo-proces) en zijn advocaat Derk Wiersum. De moord op De Vries is volgens het OM \"niet los te zien\" van die liquidaties. De misdaadjournalist was een adviseur van B. In alle drie deze zaken is er een connectie met Riouan Taghi. Een van de verdachten noemde Taghi \"de klootzak die het allemaal organiseerde\", volgens de advocaat-generaal. De hoogste baas van het OM noemde eerder de koppeling met Taghi \"waarschijnlijk\". Daar is echter geen bewijs voor en daarom staat Taghi niet terecht voor de moord op De Vries. 6 juli 2021 De Vries werd op 6 juli 2021 op 64-jarige leeftijd neergeschoten in Amsterdam, kort nadat hij een tv-studio had verlaten. Hij overleed in het ziekenhuis aan zijn verwondingen. Vanaf maandag 27 oktober vinden de pleidooien van de verdachten plaats. Hun advocaten krijgen dan de gelegenheid te reageren op de beschuldigingen en de strafeisen van het OM. Op 6 juli 2024, exact drie jaar na de moordaanslag, werd op het Leidseplein in Amsterdam een monument ter ere van De Vries onthuld:","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585825","published_date":"2025-10-09T15:13:11","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.017534","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":712,"author":null,"raw_content_length":5637,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.56,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Openbaar Ministerie"],"persons":["Christopher","Delano G.","Peter R. de Vries"],"locations":["Konrad","Erickson","gevangenisstraffen"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4340,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hoger beroep","levenslang","liquidatie","Ministerie","levenslange gevangenisstraffen","de drie hoofdverdachten","de moordaanslag","misdaadjournalist","jaar","celstraf"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["misdaadjournalist"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hoger beroep":4.0,"levenslang":2.0,"liquidatie":2.0,"Ministerie":1.0,"levenslange gevangenisstraffen":1.0,"de drie hoofdverdachten":1.0,"de moordaanslag":1.0,"misdaadjournalist":1.0,"jaar":1.0,"celstraf":1.0}},"age_hours":3.4885864841666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7637,"joy":0.0312,"surprise":0.13,"sadness":0.0331,"fear":0.0121,"anger":0.0184,"disgust":0.0116},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":0,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":0,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":0,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":0,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":1.35,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":["Amsterdam"],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Could be used as a case study in courses on ethics and societal impact of technology.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article discusses the legal proceedings related to the murder of journalist Peter R. de Vries.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_e520fb607d65","title":"Poetin bekent alsnog schuld voor neerstorten Azerbeidzjaans vliegtuig","content":"Russisch luchtafweergeschut is verantwoordelijk voor het neerstorten van een Azerbeidzjaans passagiersvliegtuig, eind vorig jaar. Dat heeft de Russische president Poetin vandaag bevestigd tegen zijn Azerbeidzjaanse ambtgenoot Aliyev. Poetin heeft zijn excuses aangeboden. Poetin is bij een overleg met voormalige Sovjetlanden en sprak daar met Aliyev. Hij beloofde hem ook om de verantwoordelijken voor de crash te straffen en zegde een schadevergoeding voor de slachtoffers toe. Een toestel van de nationale luchtvaartmaatschappij van Azerbeidzjan stortte vorig jaar neer op eerste kerstdag. Het was onderweg van de hoofdstad Bakoe naar Grozny, in Tsjetsjenië. Daar kon het niet landen en het vliegtuig werd naar Aqtau in Kazachstan gestuurd, aan de overkant van de Kaspische Zee. Vlak bij het vliegveld van Aqtau stortte het neer. 38 van 67 inzittenden kwamen om het leven. 'Tragisch' Russische persbureaus maakten melding van een omleiding vanwege mist en van vogels in de motor. Maar al snel werd duidelijk dat het toestel door een Russische raket was geraakt. Mensen die de crash overleefden, zeiden dat ze knallen hadden gehoord. Een paar dagen later bood Poetin excuses aan voor het \"tragische incident\" in het Russische luchtruim, al liet hij de oorzaak van de crash in het midden. Wel meldde Moskou dat er op dat moment luchtafweergeschut was ingezet \"tegen Oekraïense drones\". Dat het vliegtuig daardoor was geraakt, werd niet gezegd. In de dagen na de crash stelde Aliyev weliswaar dat Rusland het vliegtuig niet expres had beschoten, maar hij eiste behalve excuses ook een schuldbekentenis en compensatie voor zijn land en de slachtoffers. Daar heeft Poetin nu aan voldaan. Vermoedelijk probeert hij de relatie tussen Rusland en Azerbeidzjan te herstellen, die door de vliegramp verder verslechterde.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585823","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:50:15","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.018241","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":276,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1911,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.38,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Poetin","Azerbeidzjan","Aqtau"],"locations":["Tsjetsjenië","Sovjetlanden","Aliyev"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1812,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["schuld","neerstorten","vliegtuig","een Azerbeidzjaans passagiersvliegtuig","eind","vorig jaar","Dat","de Russische president","zijn Azerbeidzjaanse ambtgenoot","zijn excuses"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"schuld":2.0,"neerstorten":2.0,"vliegtuig":2.0,"een Azerbeidzjaans passagiersvliegtuig":1.0,"eind":1.0,"vorig jaar":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"de Russische president":1.0,"zijn Azerbeidzjaanse ambtgenoot":1.0,"zijn excuses":1.0}},"age_hours":3.8708233605555558,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7019,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.1049,"sadness":0.0548,"fear":0.0574,"anger":0.0332,"disgust":0.0358},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.05,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"none"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Azerbaijan Airlines","country":"Azerbaijan","role":"National airline"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article reports on a geopolitical event where Russia admitted responsibility for shooting down an Azeri passenger plane.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_fc2a8423c324","title":"Beverwijk vraagt hulp voor online dreiging en geweld","content":"\"Alles veilig, alles voorbij, hoppa helemaal goed!\" Volgens een paar jongens op een trapveldje in Beverwijk is de rust terug, een maand na de geweldsexplosie tussen groepen jongeren uit Beverwijk, Heemskerk en Haarlem. Op sociale media verschenen begin september gewelddadige video's van mishandelingen en met AI gemaakte beelden van een ontploffing van een school. Middelbare scholen in Heemskerk en Beverwijk gingen uit voorzorg een dag dicht en er werd een veiligheidsrisicogebied ingesteld waarin preventief kon worden gefouilleerd en het samenkomen in groepen groter dan drie verboden was. Een zware maatregel maar de onrust was dan ook groot. Preventie met Gezag Volgens burgemeester Martijn Smit van Beverwijk heeft het geholpen. Er werden acht jongeren aangehouden en sommigen zijn inmiddels veroordeeld. Ook zijn wapens als messen en boksbeugels in bezit genomen. Maar de burgemeester vindt dat niet genoeg. Hij heeft als bestuurder van een kleine stad behoefte aan meer middelen en expertise vanuit Den Haag. \"We zijn niet aanwezig in die online wereld, en daar hebben we echt iets te doen, ik zie dat we als gemeente nu niet in staat zijn daar aan te sluiten\". Smit zou graag meedoen aan het programma Preventie met Gezag. Dit programma van de Rijksoverheid biedt jongeren kansen en stelt grenzen aan crimineel gedrag. Grotere steden komen ervoor in aanmerking, maar Beverwijk niet. En dat terwijl, zoals gebleken, daar wel grootstedelijke problemen spelen. 'Van de straat houden' Bij Preventie met Gezag wordt bijvoorbeeld gekeken naar extra locaties voor jongerenwerk. Precies waar Lars Steeneken, manager jongerenwerk van jeugdcentrum Nul251 in Beverwijk ook de oplossing ziet. In het centrum kunnen jongeren kickboksen, muziek maken, koken, gamen, spelen, praten, hangen. Het idee is in contact te blijven met jongeren en ze van de straat te houden. Hij denkt dat hard ingrijpen niet genoeg is en dat er meer geld nodig is: \"Ik zou meer willen doen, meer inzet op straat, meer online aanwezig zijn, aandacht voor de tieners. Als je niet gaat investeren in preventie en kansen geven dan is het wachten op een volgend incident.\" Jongerenwerker Steeneken gaat geregeld samen met collega's de straat op, langs hangplekken, om met jongeren te praten. In Beverwijk is nu ruimte voor drie fulltime jongerenwerkers, en dat zouden er volgens Steeneken meer moeten zijn. Toen Beverwijk vorige maand op slot ging vanwege het geweld en jongeren niet meer met drie tegelijk op straat mochten samenkomen, konden ze wel terecht in het jongerencentrum. Jongerenwerkers kunnen op zo'n moment contact maken en jongeren waarschuwen voordat ze mogelijk het slechte pad opgaan. Maar daar is dus meer geld voor nodig, benadrukt Steeneken. \"Ik zou meer willen doen. We doen goede dingen maar nu moeten we keuzes maken in wat we de jongeren kunnen bieden.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585822","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:43:16","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.019273","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":449,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3364,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Martijn Smit van Beverwijk"],"locations":["Heemskerk","Haarlem","Beverwijk","Middelbare"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2847,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hulp","online dreiging","geweld","Alles","hoppa","een paar","jongens","een trapveldje","de rust","sociale media"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hulp":2.0,"online dreiging":2.0,"geweld":2.0,"Alles":1.0,"hoppa":1.0,"een paar":1.0,"jongens":1.0,"een trapveldje":1.0,"de rust":1.0,"sociale media":1.0}},"age_hours":3.9872275047222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4997,"joy":0.03,"surprise":0.1967,"sadness":0.0296,"fear":0.037,"anger":0.1613,"disgust":0.0458},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":4.45,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":["Beverwijk","Heemskerk","Haarlem"],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[{"name":"Preventie met Gezag","country":"Netherlands","funding_type":"Government Program"}],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Social impact of energy poverty","Community engagement strategies for energy transitions"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Social aspects of energy transitions, community engagement","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The municipality of Beverwijk is seeking support to combat online threats and violence among youth, highlighting the need for preventative measures and community engagement.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_1277002dfb23","title":"China breidt exportbeperking uit: nu ook zeldzame aardmetalen en batterijen geraakt","content":"Het Chinese ministerie van Handel heeft vandaag vergaande exportbeperkingen ingevoerd op bepaalde zeldzame aardmetalen, lithium batterijen, superharde materialen (zoals industriële diamanten) en de bijbehorende technologieën. Ook is een aantal bedrijven in de anti-dronetechnologie op de zogeheten onbetrouwbare entiteitenlijst gezet. Het lijkt een reactie op de Amerikaanse maatregelen van vorige week, toen ook de Amerikaanse onbetrouwbare entiteitenlijst werd uitgebreid en veel Chinese bedrijven werden geraakt. Met die uitbreiding wordt geprobeerd de export van productieapparatuur voor hoogtechnologische goederen zoals chips aan banden te leggen. Het Chinese ministerie van Handel uitte destijds scherpe kritiek en noemde het \"buitengewoon schandalig\". Het is de zoveelste escalatie in het handelsconflict tussen de Verenigde Staten en China en een voorbereiding op een mogelijke eerste ontmoeting tussen president Trump en Xi Jinping rond 1 november. Hoewel nog onbevestigd door Chinese zijde, zou de ontmoeting gaan plaatsvinden tijdens de APEC-top in Zuid-Korea. China lijkt de VS te willen laten voelen hoe afhankelijk de VS is van Chinese grondstoffen en technologie om zo sterk die eventuele ontmoeting in te gaan. De Chinese maatregelen gaan ook pas daarna in, op 8 november. Beide pakketten aan maatregelen zijn \"landenneutraal\", wat betekent dat ook bedrijven uit andere landen, zoals Nederland, de gevolgen zullen ondervinden. Wat is een onbetrouwbare entiteitenlijst? Op het moment dat een bedrijf op die lijst komt, heeft het volgens de Chinese of Amerikaanse overheid activiteiten ondernomen die in strijd zijn met de nationale veiligheid, het buitenlands beleid of de economische belangen. Het gevolg kan bijvoorbeeld zijn dat vergunningen worden ingetrokken, investeringen worden geweigerd of dat er niet langer zaken mogen worden gedaan met bedrijven uit dat land. Daarbij gaat een plek op deze lijst vaak ook gepaard met aanzienlijke internationale reputatieschade. In april kondigde China exportrestricties aan op zeven van de zeventien soorten zeldzame aardmetalen en bijbehorende magneten. China heeft een bijna volledig wereldwijd monopolie op de verwerking van zeldzame aardmetalen. Die maatregelen hebben al tot productiestops in Europa geleid, ondanks Chinese beloften om aanvragen voor de Europese exportvergunningen snel te behandelen. De Europese Kamer van Koophandel in China zei vorige maand nog dat slechts 14 procent van de aanvragen van Europese bedrijven waren goedgekeurd in de periode augustus tot begin september. Uitbreiding De maatregelen gaan nu nog een flink stuk verder. De export van andere soorten zeldzame aardmetalen (holmium, erbium, thulium en ytterbium) wordt nu ook beperkt, net als veel van de technologie die nodig is om de metalen te delven en te verwerken. Ook als er in producten of halffabricaten sporen van Chinese zeldzame aardmetalen zitten of ergens in de toeleveringsketens gebruikt is gemaakt van dit soort Chinese technologie, moet er nu toestemming worden gevraagd aan Peking. Verder wordt het strafbaar voor Chinese staatsburgers om deze technologie of kennis te delen in het buitenland. \"China probeert hiermee ook grip te krijgen op de export van het buitenland naar het buitenland\", zegt Joris Teer, analist economische veiligheid aan het Instituut voor veiligheidsstudies van de EU. Omdat zeldzame aardmetalen in veel elektronica verwerkt zijn, denk aan vitale sectoren als defensie, maar ook groene technologie, en de auto-industrie, zal het de internationale handel ook buiten China sterk bemoeilijken, denkt Teer. Correspondent Laura van Megen trok deze zomer de Chinese heuvels in, op zoek naar de strategische grondstoffen van China: China zegt dat de Chinese zeldzame aardmetalen zijn gebruikt door anderen voor militaire doeleinden en dat daarom deze maatregelen worden genomen om \"nationale veiligheid en nationale belangen te waarborgen\". Maar ook bepaalde krachtige lithiumbatterijen en bijbehorende technologie zijn nu onder exportrestricties geplaatst. China is ook hier wereldleider in en beschikt over zo'n 80 procent van de wereldwijde productiecapaciteit. In juli plaatste China ook al enkele soorten technologieën voor batterijen voor elektrische voertuigen onder exportcontroles. Verharding Elmar Otten van brancheorganisatie Evofenedex zegt een verharding van de handelsoorlog te zien, \"waarbij China zijn dominante positie op het gebied van zeldzame aardmetalen uitbuit\". De organisatie vreest ook voor verdere maatregelen specifiek gericht tegen de EU, in reactie op deze week aangekondigde Europese plannen voor maatregelen tegen goedkoop Chinees staal. Voor de plannen wereldwijd, van Europa tot de VS en Australië, om de toeleveringsketens van zeldzame aardmetalen minder afhankelijk van China te maken door zelf te investeren in mijnbouw en verwerking, is het ook slecht nieuws. \"Peking verankert op deze manier Europa's afhankelijkheden van China\", aldus Joris Teer. Veel van de benodigde kennis en technologie hiervoor zit in China en moet daar nu dus blijven.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585821","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:36:52","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.020532","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":729,"author":null,"raw_content_length":5454,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.645,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ministerie van Handel"],"persons":[],"locations":["China","Verenigde Staten"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":5062,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["batterijen","exportbeperking","zeldzame aardmetalen","Het Chinese ministerie","Handel","vergaande exportbeperkingen","bepaalde zeldzame aardmetalen","superharde materialen","industriële diamanten","de bijbehorende technologieën"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"batterijen":3.0,"exportbeperking":2.0,"zeldzame aardmetalen":2.0,"Het Chinese ministerie":1.0,"Handel":1.0,"vergaande exportbeperkingen":1.0,"bepaalde zeldzame aardmetalen":1.0,"superharde materialen":1.0,"industriële diamanten":1.0,"de bijbehorende technologieën":1.0}},"age_hours":4.093908250277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8238,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0805,"sadness":0.0142,"fear":0.0189,"anger":0.0237,"disgust":0.0285},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":8,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":7,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":6.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":true,"mobility_electrification":true,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":true},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":true,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":true},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Evofenedex","country":"Netherlands","role":"brancheorganisatie (trade association)"}],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Instituut voor veiligheidsstudies van de EU","country":"EU","collaboration_type":"analysis"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of export restrictions on battery supply chains","Strategies for diversifying rare earth element sources for Dutch industry","Analysis of EU policy responses to Chinese export controls"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Integration into supply chain management and international trade modules within energy engineering curriculum.","hands_on_opportunities":"Potentially analyzing alternative battery chemistries and materials in the lab."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"China's expanded export restrictions on rare earth elements and lithium batteries pose a significant challenge to the EU's energy transition and supply chain security.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_78c633e5437e","title":"Achter de wapenstilstand: wie bepaalt straks de toekomst van Gaza?","content":"De euforie over het staakt-het-vuren tussen Israël en Hamas verhult grote onzekerheid over de toekomst van de Gazastrook en de vooral over de rechten van de Palestijnen onder het plan van Donald Trump. Het akkoord dat vannacht werd bereikt, is slechts de eerste fase van een plan met drie stadia: een wapenstilstand, de ontwapening van Hamas en uiteindelijk de opbouw van een nieuw bestuur in de Gazastrook. Voor de Palestijnen die maandenlang onder bombardementen leefden gloort eindelijk licht aan het einde van de tunnel. Maar de toestand is broos, want niemand weet of het staakt-het-vuren standhoudt na deze eerste fase. Vannacht werd zowel in Gaza als in Israël met blijdschap gereageerd op het akkoord: Een belangrijk element in het plan is dat Hamas volledig uit het bestuur van Gaza wordt verwijderd. De controle over de veiligheid en het bestuur zou tijdelijk in handen komen van een internationaal orgaan onder leiding van de zogenoemde Peace Council, waarin ook Trump zelf en de voormalige Brits premier Tony Blair naar verluidt zouden plaatsnemen. Maar hoe het bestuur van de Gazastrook eruit zal zien en wie inspraak krijgt, is onduidelijk. In elk geval zou de partij die in 2006 de verkiezingen won in Gaza en er sindsdien de macht had volledig uit het politieke landschap verdwijnen, en de vraag rijst hoe realistisch dat is. Voorstanders zien het als een noodzakelijke stap richting stabiliteit, critici waarschuwen dat het een machtsvacuüm kan creëren waarin de Palestijnen buitenspel worden gezet. Zelfbeschikking als vertrekpunt Marieke de Hoon, hoofddocent internationaal strafrecht aan de Universiteit van Amsterdam, wijst erop dat het \"recht op zelfbeschikking\" voor Palestijnen wel in het plan wordt genoemd, maar slechts als iets waar \"naar gestreefd kan worden\". \"Het betekent in feite dat hun recht op zelfbeschikking niet wordt erkend, maar wordt vooruitgeschoven,\" zegt ze. \"Dat is problematisch, want dat recht zou juist het vertrekpunt moeten zijn van elk vredesplan.\" Zelfbeschikking betekent volgens De Hoon niet per se een eigen staat, maar wel dat Palestijnen zelf mogen bepalen wat er met hun grondgebied en toekomst gebeurt. \"Dat is meermaals bevestigd door het Internationaal Gerechtshof. Dat het hier vaag en voorwaardelijk wordt geformuleerd, ondermijnt dat principe.\" Internationaal bestuur en wederopbouw Volgens De Hoon is het cruciaal dat Palestijnen zelf betrokken worden bij beslissingen over de toekomst van hun gebied. \"Als dit bestuur niet inclusief wordt, loop je het risico dat Gaza verandert in een soort investeringsproject. Dan wordt er een modern Gaza gebouwd met glanzende torens, maar zonder echte zeggenschap of betaalbare woningen voor de mensen die er nu wonen.\" Die zorgen leven ook bij Palestijnse organisaties. Zij vrezen dat het plan vooral voorziet in de Israëlische veiligheidsbelangen en de belangen van westerse geldschieters. In Gaza wordt cynisch gesproken over een \"nieuwe skyline boven oude ruïnes\", een herbouw zonder rechten, zonder politieke verzoening, en vooral zonder restitutie voor de slachtoffers van de oorlog. Wantrouwen over vrede Met de vrijlating van de Israëlische gijzelaars, die maandag moet worden voltooid, raakt Hamas vrijwel al zijn onderhandelingsmacht kwijt. In het plan is niet vastgelegd hoe de veiligheid van Hamas-leden of van de Palestijnse bevolking wordt gewaarborgd zodra het Israëlische leger zich heeft teruggetrokken tot de zogenoemde gele lijn. Dat voedt de vrees dat Israël later de oorlog kan hervatten onder het voorwendsel van veiligheid, wat bij vorige wapenstilstanden ook gebeurde. Uren na het akkoord tussen Israël en Hamas lijkt de situatie in Gaza nog niet veel verbeterd, nog steeds zijn er explosies te zien, zoals hier in zuidelijk-Gaza: Aan Israëlische zijde groeit ondertussen de politieke spanning. Premier Netanyahu noemde het \"een grote dag voor Israël\", maar ministers uit zijn rechtse coalitie, onder wie Bezalel Smotrich, hebben aangekondigd tegen te stemmen. Zij willen dat Israël, zodra de gijzelaars zijn teruggekeerd, doorgaat met de \"vernietiging van Hamas\". Voor Hamas is dat een reden voor groot wantrouwen. Geen garanties Hamas vreest dat Israël zonder internationale ­garanties het akkoord elk moment kan terugdraaien. De organisatie heeft herhaaldelijk gevraagd om toezicht door de VN of door de bemiddelende landen Qatar, Egypte en Turkije, maar in het huidige plan ontbreekt een mechanisme dat de veiligheid van haar leden of van burgers in Gaza garandeert. Daarmee dreigt een herhaling van eerdere wapenstilstanden die maar kort standhielden. Zolang er geen duidelijke veiligheids­garanties zijn, blijft de wapenstilstand voor Hamas een riskante gok, een keuze uit noodzaak, met de rug tegen de muur.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585820","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:23:07","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:36:35.021943","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":722,"author":null,"raw_content_length":5045,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.61,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Gazastrook"],"persons":["Vannacht","Hamas","Donald Trump"],"locations":["Gaza","Hamas","Israël"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4741,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["de toekomst","de wapenstilstand","wie","Gaza","de Gazastrook","De euforie","het staakt-het-vuren","grote onzekerheid","de vooral over de rechten","het plan"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"de toekomst":3.0,"de wapenstilstand":2.0,"wie":2.0,"Gaza":2.0,"de Gazastrook":2.0,"De euforie":1.0,"het staakt-het-vuren":1.0,"grote onzekerheid":1.0,"de vooral over de rechten":1.0,"het plan":1.0}},"age_hours":4.323090769166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.48,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0633,"sadness":0.0261,"fear":0.2963,"anger":0.0847,"disgust":0.0432},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":2,"regional_impact_potential":1},"seece_relevance_score":2.4,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"none"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Universiteit van Amsterdam","country":"Netherlands","collaboration_type":"Expert Opinion"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article discusses the political situation in Gaza following a ceasefire, focusing on the potential for reconstruction and governance.
