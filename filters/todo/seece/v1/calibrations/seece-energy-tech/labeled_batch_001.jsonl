{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_6bb839d400ab","title":"Nobelprijs voor de Literatuur voor Hongaarse auteur László Krasznahorkai","content":"De Nobelprijs voor de Literatuur gaat naar de Hongaarse auteur László Krasznahorkai (71). Dat heeft het Nobelcomité in de Zweedse hoofdstad Stockholm bekendgemaakt. Het comité prijst Krasznahorkai \"voor zijn meeslepende en visionaire oeuvre dat, te midden van apocalyptische terreur, de kracht van kunst opnieuw bevestigt.\" Krasznahorkai werd in 1954 geboren in het kleine stadje Gyula in het zuidoosten van Hongarije, vlak bij de Roemeense grens. Dit gebied vormde het decor van zijn eerste roman Satanstango in 1985. Het comité noemt dat een literaire sensatie in Hongarije. \"De roman beschrijft op zeer suggestieve wijze een groep straatarme bewoners van een verlaten collectieve boerderij op het Hongaarse platteland vlak voor de val van het communisme. Iedereen in de roman wacht op een wonder, een hoop die vanaf het begin wordt doorprikt door het Kafka-motto in de inleiding van het boek: 'In dat geval zal ik het missen door erop te wachten.'\" China en Japan Krasznahorkai wordt omschreven als \"een groot schrijver in de Midden-Europese traditie die zich uitstrekt van Kafka tot Thomas Bernhard, en wordt gekenmerkt door absurdisme en groteske overdaad\", zegt het comité. \"Maar hij kijkt ook naar het Oosten en hanteert een meer contemplatieve, fijn afgestemde toon\", zegt het comité. \"Het resultaat is een reeks werken die zijn geïnspireerd door de diepe indrukken die zijn reizen naar China en Japan op hem hebben gemaakt.\" Krasznahorkai schreef onder meer In het noorden bij een berg, in het zuiden bij een meer, in het westen via paden, in het oosten bij een beek in 2003, een roman die gaat over de zoektocht naar een geheime tuin ten zuidoosten van Kyoto. Het comité noemt het \"een mysterieus verhaal met krachtige lyrische passages\". Daarna volgde onder meer in 2008 een verzameling van zeventien verhalen die zich richten op kunstenaars uit verschillende tijden en plekken. \"Samen met zijn vijf epische romans vormt het Krasznahorkais belangrijkste werk\", vindt het comité. \"Bijzonder onvergetelijk is de openingsscène, waarin een sneeuwwitte reiger roerloos in het midden van de rivier Kamo in Kyoto staat te wachten op zijn prooi. Onzichtbaar voor de massa's voorbijgangers wordt de vogel een ongrijpbaar beeld van de bijzondere situatie van de kunstenaar.\" Het comité heeft de auteur op de hoogte gebracht via de telefoon. Hij is op dit moment in Frankfurt. Morgen Nobelprijs voor de Vrede Het comité kent de prijs ieder jaar toe aan de auteur die, volgens de regels van initiatiefnemer Alfred Nobel, \"het opmerkelijkste werk met een idealistische trend heeft geschreven\". Krasznahorkai is de tweede Hongaarse laureaat, na Imre Kertész in 2002. Vorig jaar ging de Nobelprijs voor de Literatuur naar de Zuid-Koreaanse auteur Han Kang. Zij brak internationaal door met De vegetariër. Eerder deze week werden de winnaars van de Nobelprijzen voor Geneeskunde, Natuurkunde en Scheikunde bekendgemaakt. Morgen volgt de aankondiging van de Nobelprijs voor de Vrede. Volgende week wordt de Nobelprijs voor Economie toegekend. De prijzen worden uitgereikt op 10 december, de sterfdag van naamgever Alfred Nobel. Elke winnaar krijgt omgerekend ongeveer een miljoen euro. Als er meerdere winnaars zijn, wordt het geld verdeeld. Daarnaast krijgen de winnaars ook een medaille en een diploma.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585804","published_date":"2025-10-09T11:02:54","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:52:00.646818","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":514,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3962,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.57,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Gyula","László Krasznahorkai"],"locations":["Krasznahorkai","Hongarije","Nobelprijs","Stockholm"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3298,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["de Literatuur","Hongaarse auteur","de Hongaarse auteur","Dat","de Zweedse hoofdstad","Het comité","zijn meeslepende","oeuvre","dat","midden van apocalyptische terreur"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat","dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"de Literatuur":3.0,"Hongaarse auteur":2.0,"de Hongaarse auteur":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"de Zweedse hoofdstad":1.0,"Het comité":1.0,"zijn meeslepende":1.0,"oeuvre":1.0,"dat":1.0,"midden van apocalyptische terreur":1.0}},"age_hours":1.919930409722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6138,"joy":0.0349,"surprise":0.1508,"sadness":0.0556,"fear":0.0555,"anger":0.0346,"disgust":0.0547},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":1,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.0,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article is about the Nobel Prize for Literature being awarded to László Krasznahorkai, a Hungarian author.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c12b249fce57","title":"Israël en Hamas akkoord onder internationale druk, maar obstakels blijven","content":"Opluchting en blijdschap overheersen in Gaza en Israël nu er een eerste akkoord ligt: de laatste gijzelaars worden vrijgelaten en het Israëlische leger zal beginnen zich terug te trekken. Maar er is ook spanning, want zal het allemaal goed gaan? Midden-Oostenexperts zijn optimistisch. \"Mijn telefoon staat roodgloeiend\", zegt hoogleraar Joodse Studies Bart Wallet. \"Over het algemeen heerst de opluchting en het idee dat nu aan die twee jaar ellende een einde komt, dat dit een keerpunt kan zijn.\" Dat er na ruim twee dagen onderhandelen al witte rook zou zijn, was van tevoren niet verwacht. Maar Wallet kijkt er ook niet van op. \"Het was deze week wel duidelijk dat zowel Amerika als Turkije, Qatar en Egypte er vol bovenop zaten en de strijdende partijen niet heel veel ruimte meer gaven om daar nog onderuit te komen.\" Ze moeten die druk er nu wel op houden, benadrukt hij. Ook volgens Peter Malcontent, docent internationale betrekkingen aan de Universiteit Utrecht, is die druk heel belangrijk. Niet alleen vanuit het Witte Huis, maar ook vanuit Turkije, Egypte en Qatar. \"Daar is Hamas gevoelig voor\", zegt Malcontent. \"Die landen hebben ervoor gezorgd dat de overtuiging er is dat president Trump er echt voor zal zorgen dat Israël niet de strijd zal hervatten. Dat moet Hamas over de streep hebben getrokken.\" Overigens had Hamas niet zo gek veel keuze meer, zegt hij. \"Hier zouden ze waarschijnlijk een jaar geleden nooit mee hebben ingestemd. Nu zitten ze in een fase waarin ze hun knopen tellen en proberen uit te vinden hoe ze hieruit kunnen komen op een zo net mogelijke manier. Ieder akkoord dat een koninklijke terugtocht biedt aan Hamas is welkom. Dit plan gaat verder dan eerdere plannen, omdat het ook een soort van toekomstbeeld biedt. Hamas kan zeggen: kijk, we hebben niet twee jaar voor niets gevochten als we straks onze wapens inleveren.\" De enorme druk van buitenaf en het uitgebreide Gaza-voorstel van de VS - het twintigpuntenplan - maakt het daarnaast anders dan bij het eerdere akkoord dat met veel moeite tot stand kwam in Qatar, in januari. Ook toen werden er gijzelaars vrijgelaten, maar kort daarna liep het weer mis, voerde Israël de aanvallen op, hield het hulpkonvooien tegen en bereikte de situatie in Gaza een nieuw dieptepunt. Malcontent: \"Nu zie je dat de Amerikanen de druk hebben opgevoerd, en met de eenheid die de Arabische landen uitstralen zie je dat er niet alleen voor Hamas maar ook voor Israël minder keus was. Met als gevolg dat het ineens allemaal vrij snel kon en dat het akkoord voor beide partijen voldoende garanties biedt.\" Volgende stap Hij heeft er vertrouwen in dat nu beide partijen A hebben gezegd, de kans groot is dat er ook B wordt gezegd: fase 2, waarin Hamas de wapens moet inleveren. \"Stel de gijzelaars worden vrijgelaten, Israël trekt zich terug en de hulpverlening komt weer op gang, als Hamas dan zou weigeren de wapens in te leveren, dan wordt het heel lastig voor de Amerikanen om Israël ervan te overtuigen de strijd niet te hervatten.\" Hij vermoedt dat er de afgelopen dagen ook al is gesproken over dat tweede deel van het akkoord. \"Alleen zijn daar nog geen definitieve afspraken over gemaakt.\" Peter Wijninga, defensiespecialist aan het Haags Centrum voor Strategische Studies, was verrast door het snelle akkoord. \"Ik had het nog niet verwacht. Maar het was wel duidelijk dat het dit keer tot een einde moest komen. Na twee jaar kreeg iedereen er genoeg van. De Amerikanen ook, er is tegen Israël en Hamas gezegd; het is nu of nooit.\" Wijninga over het akkoord: Vanaf vandaag wordt er verder onderhandeld. En dat kan toch nog best lastig worden, waarschuwt Wijninga. \"Dat ze bereid zijn gijzelaars vrij te laten betekent dat ze op zijn minst het gevoel hebben dat het dit keer wel gaat slagen.\" Maar er zijn nog wel obstakels. Of er een internationaal bestuur moet komen bijvoorbeeld, daar is Hamas niet voor, en ontwapening is ook een heikel punt\", somt hij op. \"Maar er is in ieder geval hoop aan beide kanten dat er uitzicht is op een wat duurzamere vrede dan tot nog toe het geval is geweest.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585803","published_date":"2025-10-09T10:41:39","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:52:00.647963","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":694,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4307,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.47,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ook"],"persons":["Bart Wallet","Joodse Studies","Peter Malcontent"],"locations":["Israël","Turkije","Amerika","Gaza"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4079,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["internationale druk","obstakels","Opluchting","blijdschap","een eerste akkoord","de laatste gijzelaars","het Israëlische leger","spanning","Mijn telefoon","hoogleraar"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"internationale druk":2.0,"obstakels":2.0,"Opluchting":1.0,"blijdschap":1.0,"een eerste akkoord":1.0,"de laatste gijzelaars":1.0,"het Israëlische leger":1.0,"spanning":1.0,"Mijn telefoon":1.0,"hoogleraar":1.0}},"age_hours":2.2741132522222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7319,"joy":0.0267,"surprise":0.097,"sadness":0.0351,"fear":0.0525,"anger":0.0312,"disgust":0.0256},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"scaling","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.7,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Universiteit Utrecht","country":"Netherlands","collaboration_type":"Expert Opinion"},{"name":"Haags Centrum voor Strategische Studies","country":"Netherlands","collaboration_type":"Expert Opinion"}],"government_programs":[{"name":"Amerika","country":"USA","funding_type":"Political Pressure"},{"name":"Turkije","country":"Turkey","funding_type":"Political Pressure"},{"name":"Qatar","country":"Qatar","funding_type":"Political Pressure"},{"name":"Egypte","country":"Egypt","funding_type":"Political Pressure"}],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of international pressure on energy infrastructure development","Role of renewable energy in post-conflict reconstruction"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Incorporate as a case study in international relations and energy policy courses.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article discusses a potential peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, highlighting the role of international pressure.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_e1a4dd832d41","title":"Eerste pauselijke brief van Leo XIV: pak structurele oorzaken armoede aan","content":"Dilexi te (Ik heb je liefgehad). Dit Latijnse citaat uit het Bijbelboek Openbaring is de titel van de eerste pauselijke brief van Leo XIV. De brief is gericht aan alle rooms-katholieken. En ook een beetje aan de rest van de wereld, want velen willen na vijf maanden graag weten wat voor boodschap Leo verkondigt en wat voor paus hij wil zijn. Officieel is het een apostolische exhortatie. Dat is een persoonlijke aanmoediging van de paus om mensen vanuit hun geloof bewuster te laten handelen rond een bepaald thema. Dat thema is de liefde voor de armen. Daarmee plaatst Leo XIV zich nadrukkelijk in de lijn van zijn voorganger Franciscus, die tijdens zijn ruim twaalfjarig pausschap voortdurend opkwam voor mensen die in deze wereld niets hebben en in de verdrukking zitten. Werk Franciscus voltooid Om precies te zijn voltooit Leo XIV het werk van zijn voorganger, want het overgrote deel van deze brief was al geschreven door Franciscus, die ook de titel koos. In 2024 had de Argentijnse paus zijn, naar we nu weten laatste, encycliek gepubliceerd onder de titel Dilexit nos (Hij heeft ons liefgehad). Die ging over de menselijke en de goddelijke liefde van Christus en had als encycliek meer gewicht. De brief van vandaag is er een vervolg op. Met de publicatie ervan is het werk van Franciscus voltooid en neemt Leo XIV met beide handen het roer over. Dat pausen een document van hun voorganger afmaken en publiceren, is overigens niet nieuw. De eerste encycliek van paus Franciscus was eigenlijk geschreven door zijn voorganger Benedictus XVI, al voegde de Argentijnse paus wel een aantal eigen opmerkingen toe. Armenzorg en naastenliefde Datzelfde doet Leo XIV in deze brief ook. Zo laat hij de publicatie vergezellen door een handgeschreven briefje in het Engels om de bisschoppen op te roepen de armen te helpen. Het zijn immers de bisschoppen die in eerste instantie de inhoud moeten implementeren in hun lokale kerken. Die inhoud is in feite kort en kernachtig: zorg voor de armen is de centrale boodschap van het evangelie. Naastenliefde is voor een goed katholiek geen optie, maar een vereiste. De zorg voor de armen is de taak van iedereen. Wegkijken of onverschilligheid kunnen niet, is Leo's boodschap. In de brief geeft Leo een lange reeks voorbeelden van hoe mensen van de Kerk zich door de eeuwen heen hebben ingezet om praktische naastenliefde te bevorderen. Van heiligen tot pausen. Van het Tweede Vaticaans Concilie, een vergadering om de Kerk in de pas met de moderne tijd te brengen, tot en met Johannes Paulus II, Benedictus XVI en natuurlijk Franciscus. Bij zijn verkiezing in 2013 verklaarde de Argentijnse paus immers dat hij een \"arme Kerk voor de armen\" wenste. 'Dictatuur van een dodelijke economie' De toon van de brief wordt indringender wanneer de achterliggende oorzaken van de armoede en sociale ongelijkheid worden besproken. Leo onderschrijft het concept van Franciscus dat door de zucht naar materiële rijkdom uitbuiting en ongelijkheid alleen maar groeien. De armen betalen in wezen de welvaart van de rijke landen. Verwijzend naar teksten van Franciscus spreekt Leo XIV de wens uit dat er meer politici moeten komen om de structurele oorzaken van armoede middels een authentieke dialoog aan te pakken. Om een einde te maken aan de \"dictatuur van een dodelijke economie\" die ervoor zorgt dat velen armer worden ten behoeve van een steeds kleiner wordende groep rijken. Een markteconomie zonder regels en financiële speculatie vormen de oorzaak van alle ongelijkheid, de verwoesting van het milieu en een aantasting van de menselijke waardigheid, aldus Leo. Krachtig zijn ook de passages over migratie. Een fenomeen dat de nieuwe paus goed heeft leren kennen tijdens zijn lange jaren als missionaris in Peru. Op dat vlak omarmt Leo de woorden van zijn voorganger Franciscus totaal: migranten moeten worden ontvangen, beschermd, vooruitgeholpen en geïntegreerd in de samenleving. Een boodschap die bijvoorbeeld in zijn vaderland de Verenigde Staten niet door iedereen met gejuich zal worden ontvangen. Met deze brief bekent paus Leo XIV duidelijk kleur en geeft hij aan de koers van zijn voorganger te willen voortzetten. Hoogstwaarschijnlijk kunnen we voor het eind van dit jaar zijn eerste echte soloproductie verwachten. Het zal een encycliek zijn over de grote uitdaging van onze moderne tijd: kunstmatige intelligentie en de menselijke waardigheid.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585800","published_date":"2025-10-09T10:00:01","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:52:00.649063","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":708,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4602,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.54,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Leo XIV"],"locations":["Dilexi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4391,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Eerste pauselijke brief","pak","structurele oorzaken","armoede","Dit Latijnse citaat","het Bijbelboek","Openbaring","de eerste pauselijke brief","De brief","alle rooms-katholieken"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Eerste pauselijke brief":2.0,"pak":2.0,"structurele oorzaken":2.0,"armoede":2.0,"Dit Latijnse citaat":1.0,"het Bijbelboek":1.0,"Openbaring":1.0,"de eerste pauselijke brief":1.0,"De brief":1.0,"alle rooms-katholieken":1.0}},"age_hours":2.9680179633333332,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8163,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0493,"sadness":0.0301,"fear":0.0227,"anger":0.0326,"disgust":0.0344},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":9,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.3,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":true,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"high"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Impact of papal encyclicals on sustainable development policies","Ethical considerations of energy poverty in the Netherlands","Role of religious institutions in promoting renewable energy adoption"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Incorporate the ethical and social implications of energy policies into the energy engineering curriculum.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The papal letter emphasizes addressing the structural causes of poverty and inequality, linking them to unchecked market economies and environmental degradation.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c8b76bb7a1e1","title":"Colombia kritisch op zeeaanvallen VS: 'Bendeleiders gebruiken geen speedboot'","content":"De Colombiaanse president Gustavo Petro zegt dat er bij een Amerikaanse aanval op een boot voor de Venezolaanse kust Colombianen zijn omgekomen. \"Er zijn aanwijzingen dat het laatste gebombardeerde schip een Colombiaans schip was met Colombiaanse burgers aan boord\", schrijft hij op X. Het is niet duidelijk waar Petro die conclusie op baseert. De vraag om bewijs kaatst hij terug naar de VS: \"Laat het Witte Huis ons de informatie geven over de mensen die zijn omgekomen door de Amerikaanse raketten, zodat we kunnen zien of mijn informatie ongegrond is.\" Zeker is dat Petro zich met de uitspraak voor het eerst mengt in de strijd die de VS heeft geopend op wat de Amerikanen omschrijven als 'drugsboten' van kartels uit Venezuela. Sinds begin september heeft de VS meerdere boten aangevallen waarmee drugs naar Amerikaans grondgebied zouden worden gesmokkeld. Bewijs daarvoor bleef echter altijd uit. De meest recente aanval was afgelopen vrijdag op een kleine boot voor de kust van Venezuela. De Amerikaanse defensieminister Hegseth deelde beelden van de aanval op sociale media met daarbij de mededeling dat \"narco-terroristen\" waren omgebracht. Er zouden bij de aanval vier mensen zijn gedood. Hegseth schreef dat Amerikaanse inlichtingendiensten er niet aan twijfelen dat met dit vaartuig drugs werden vervoerd. Hegseth deelde deze beelden van de aanval: Petro suggereert nu dat er Colombianen aan boord waren van deze boot. \"De agressie is gericht tegen heel Latijns-Amerika en het Caribisch gebied\", voegt hij eraan toe. \"Drugshandelaren reizen in luxe vliegtuigen. Ze varen niet in speedboten door het Caribisch gebied.\" Niet alleen Petro heeft veel kritiek op de aanvallen van de VS. Mensenrechtenorganisatie Human Rights Watch noemt de aanvallen buitengerechtelijke executies. De laatste boot die was aangevallen, voer in internationale wateren bij Venezuela. De VS heeft de doden niet geïdentificeerd, net als bij de vorige drie aanvallen op boten. De Amerikaanse Senaat stemde gisteren ook over de vraag of president Trump beperkt moet worden in zijn presidentiële bevoegdheid om militair geweld te gebruiken tegen drugskartels. Het wetsvoorstel daartoe haalde het niet. Sommige Republikeinen zijn wel kritisch en willen van het Witte Huis meer duidelijkheid over de juridische rechtvaardiging voor de aanvallen op de schepen. Democraten stellen dat de aanvallen in strijd zijn met Amerikaanse en internationale wetten. Terreurorganisatie Trump heeft altijd gezegd dat hij drugssmokkelaars als 'onwettige strijders' beschouwt en dat militair geweld nodig is om hen te bestrijden. Eerdere aanvallen waren volgens Trump gericht op het Venezolaanse kartel Tren de Aragua, die hij heeft laten bestempelen als een terroristische organisatie. De Amerikaanse president claimt daarbij herhaaldelijk dat de groep onder controle staat van president Maduro van Venezuela. Hij houdt Maduro daarom verantwoordelijk voor drugshandel en moordpartijen in de VS. Er is ook een beloning uitgeloofd van 50 miljoen dollar voor informatie die leidt tot de arrestatie van Maduro. Het Witte Huis is niet blij dat de Colombiaanse president Petro zich nu ook in het conflict mengt. \"Wij kijken ernaar uit dat hij zijn ongegronde en verwerpelijke uitspraak publiekelijk intrekt, zodat we verder kunnen bouwen aan een sterke, welvarende toekomst voor zowel de VS als Colombia\", zegt een Amerikaanse functionaris. Militaire oefeningen Ondertussen is Venezuela nieuwe militaire oefeningen begonnen in twee kuststaten. \"De Verenigde Staten hebben de doodstraf ingesteld voor elke burger die ze denken te kunnen vermoorden, met als excuus dat drugs volgens hen uit Venezuela worden gesmokkeld\", reageerde Maduro op de woorden van Petro. De Venezolaanse defensieminister Padrino noemde de Amerikaanse aanvallen en militaire aanwezigheid op zee een \"ernstige bedreiging\". Hij zei ook dat president Maduro had opgeroepen tot \"een tegenoffensief\", maar het is onduidelijk wat hij daarmee bedoelt.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585798","published_date":"2025-10-09T09:49:49","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:52:00.650371","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":594,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4632,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Colombianen"],"locations":["Venezuela","Venezolaanse kust"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3974,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bendeleiders","geen speedboot","hij","De Colombiaanse president","een Amerikaanse aanval","een boot","de Venezolaanse kust","aanwijzingen","het laatste gebombardeerde schip","Colombiaanse burgers"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bendeleiders":2.0,"geen speedboot":2.0,"hij":2.0,"De Colombiaanse president":1.0,"een Amerikaanse aanval":1.0,"een boot":1.0,"de Venezolaanse kust":1.0,"aanwijzingen":1.0,"het laatste gebombardeerde schip":1.0,"Colombiaanse burgers":1.0}},"age_hours":3.1380333458333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7899,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0801,"sadness":0.0193,"fear":0.033,"anger":0.0304,"disgust":0.0353},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":2.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"none"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article discusses the political conflict between Colombia, Venezuela, and the US regarding drug trafficking.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_eed0d73e6cbc","title":"Zomerdip blijft uit: meer woningen verkocht in de zomer","content":"Er zijn de afgelopen drie maanden meer woningen verkocht dan een jaar eerder. Tussen juli en september steeg het aantal verkochte woningen met bijna 20 procent, blijkt uit nieuwe cijfers van de Nederlandse Vereniging van Makelaars (NVM). Normaal gesproken is er in de zomer een dip in het aantal verkopen, maar die bleef deze zomer uit. Er stonden in de zomermaanden 46.000 woningen in de verkoop. Dat is het hoogste aantal in deze periode sinds 2008. Een specifieke oorzaak daarvoor kan de NVM niet benoemen. \"Blijkbaar is er veel vertrouwen in de markt\", zegt een woordvoerder. In totaal werden 41.800 woningen verkocht. De verkoopprijzen van bestaande woningen stegen met 4,8 procent ten opzichte van een jaar eerder. Eerder dit jaar stegen de prijzen nog harder. Ten opzichte van een kwartaal eerder was er zelfs sprake van een lichte prijsdaling van 0,9 procent. De gemiddelde woningprijs is nu 496.000 euro. Van huur naar koop De NVM ziet nog altijd veel zogenoemde 'uitpondwoningen', dat zijn huurwoningen die nu in de verkoop gaan. Het zijn vooral appartementen of kleinere woningen en daarom vaak goedkoper; het scheelt ongeveer 90.000 euro in vergelijking met de gemiddelde verkoopprijs. Ook hebben die woningen vaker een minder goed energielabel. Het aantal nieuwbouwwoningen in de verkoop daalde van 9900 in het tweede kwartaal naar 7200 in het derde kwartaal. Dit komt door het zomerseizoen, omdat er dan minder projecten worden afgerond. De gemiddelde verkoopprijs voor een nieuwbouwwoningen is met 5 procent gestegen vergeleken met vorig jaar.
