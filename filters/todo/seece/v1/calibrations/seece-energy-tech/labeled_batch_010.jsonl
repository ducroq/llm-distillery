Despite increasing awareness, its prevention remains underrepresented in the Malaysian primary school curriculum. The SmartShield program was developed as a culturally relevant, age-appropriate, and video-based intervention to improve sexual education knowledge among primary school children. A quasi-experimental controlled trial was conducted using stratified multistage cluster sampling. Six government primary schools were randomly selected from five regions. In each school, one class from the lower and one from the upper primary were chosen. The sample size was estimated by comparing two means. The SmartShield intervention consisted of two modules per age group and was delivered through 20-minute video-guided sessions. Knowledge was assessed at baseline, post-Module 1 (Week 2), and post-Module 2 (Week 4) using validated questionnaires. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, adjusting for sex and region. A total of 881 children for each lower and upper primary student were recruited. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in knowledge scores compared to the control group across all modules and time points (p < .001). Among lower primary students, adjusted mean scores increased from 78.5% to 97.1% in the intervention group versus 80.1% to 90.3% in the control group. Among upper primary students, knowledge scores rose from 79.5% to 97.8% in the intervention group, compared to 77.6% to 95.1% in the control group. The SmartShield program was effective in enhancing child sexual abuse knowledge among Malaysian primary school children.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334401","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.579697","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":263,"author":"Azliana Aziz","raw_content_length":1858,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.315,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SmartShield"],"persons":["Azizah Othman","Nik Hussain","Mohamad Najib Mat Pa","Zaharah Sulaiman","Mohd Noor Norhayati","Azliana Aziz Child","Nik Hazlina"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1829,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Effectiveness","the i","SmartShieldi","knowledge","sexual abuse prevention","primary school children","Malaysia","Mohamad Najib Mat Pa","Mohd Noor Norhayati","Zaharah Sulaiman"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Zaharah Sulaiman"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Effectiveness":2.0,"the i":2.0,"SmartShieldi":2.0,"knowledge":2.0,"sexual abuse prevention":2.0,"primary school children":2.0,"Malaysia":2.0,"Mohamad Najib Mat Pa":1.0,"Mohd Noor Norhayati":1.0,"Zaharah Sulaiman":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744109983333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.8875,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8225,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2089,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.0093,"sadness":0.1809,"fear":0.2495,"anger":0.0305,"disgust":0.3131},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":true,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.8,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Mohamad Najib Mat Pa, Mohd Noor Norhayati, Zaharah Sulaiman, Nik Hazlina Nik Hussain, Azizah Othman, Azliana Aziz","country":"Malaysia","collaboration_type":"Research"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Cultural adaptation of educational programs","Video-based learning effectiveness","Impact of educational interventions on child safety"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of video-based learning and knowledge assessment in a specific context.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The SmartShield program, a video-based educational intervention, demonstrably improves child sexual abuse knowledge among Malaysian primary school children.

Objective To develop and internally validate a concise, clinically interpretable nomogram for EOS risk stratification in preterm neonates and to evaluate its potential for antibiotic stewardship. Methods We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study (July 2023–June 2024) including 1,059 preterm infants admitted within 72 h of birth, randomly split 7:3 into training (n = 742) and validation (n = 317). Forty-five maternal and neonatal candidates were screened (univariable tests, LASSO), followed by multivariable logistic regression to build the final model and nomogram. Discrimination (AUC), calibration (Brier score, calibration curve, Hosmer–Lemeshow), and decision-curve analysis (DCA) were assessed; two biologically plausible interactions were prespecified. Results Four routinely available variables—gestational age, birth weight, umbilical cord abnormality, and mechanical ventilation within 72 h—composed the final model. In the validation cohort, AUC was 0.818 (95% CI, 0.767–0.868), Brier score 0.158, and Hosmer–Lemeshow P = 0.71; DCA showed net benefit across 5–65% risk thresholds. Using a ≥ 0.70 treatment threshold, the model identified 88% of EOS cases while recommending antibiotics for ~10% of infants. A culture-proven-only sensitivity analysis yielded comparable discrimination (AUC 0.819) with a Brier score 0.041. Conclusions A four-factor nomogram using EMR-available variables accurately stratifies EOS risk in preterm infants and may support risk-based antibiotic decisions while limiting overtreatment.

Farkas, Bánk G. Fenyves, Szabolcs Gaál-Marschal, Csaba Varga Background Accidental hypothermia, defined by a core temperature <35 °C destabilizes metabolism, ventilation, and circulation, precipitating malignant arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. We characterized such patients in a Hungarian emergency department and sought early predictors of death or intensive care requirement. Methods In this retrospective cohort (2020–2024) at Semmelweis University, adults with measured tympanic temperature <35 °C were identified. Demographics and Hungarian Emergency Triage System categories were recorded. Severity was graded based on the thresholds of Swiss staging and the Wilderness Medical Society classification. The primary outcome was emergency department death or admission to the intensive care unit. Prognostic performance of triage category, admission temperature, hypothermia severity thresholds, and combined models was assessed with receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Odds ratios were derived from logistic regression, and separate receiver-operating-characteristic curves were generated for each predictor. Results A total of 131 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median age was 67.0 years (IQR 59.0–75.0); 88 (67.2%) were male. Median admission temperature was 29.3 °C (IQR 26.1–31.4 °C); 47 (35.9%) had severe hypothermia (<28 °C). Median emergency department length of stay was 13.7 h (IQR 9.5–18.9 h). Sixteen patients (12.2%) required intensive care and 28 (21.4%) died before transfer, yielding a 33.6% critical‑outcome rate (44/131). Incidence tracked seasonal ambient temperatures, yet environmental temperature itself was not associated with the composite outcome. Triage category predicted critical outcome better than thresholds of either hypothermia-specific scale (AUC 0.683). Adding admission temperature improved accuracy (AUC 0.740, 95% CI 0.644–0.829). Conclusions Despite milder winters, accidental hypothermia still carries substantial early mortality. Integrating admission temperature into a general triage system enhances prognostication and may guide rapid escalation of care. Our findings suggest the need for systematic surveillance, focused clinician education, and targeted resources to protect vulnerable patients in increasingly variable climates.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334328","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.580926","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":309,"author":"Csaba Varga","raw_content_length":2427,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.545,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Csaba Varga Background Accidental","Hungarian Emergency Triage System","the Wilderness Medical Society","Semmelweis University"],"persons":["Dóra Melicher","Kornél Ádám","Zsolt Bognár","Anna Stelkovics","Barbara Zadravecz-Heider","Bánk G.

Methods We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception until January 17th, 2025. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022309130). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1.0 tool, and calculated pooled relative risks and mean differences. We used GRADE’s minimally contextualized approach to determine the certainty of the evidence. Results We found 7 RCTs (n = 3053). The PS, compared to fibrinolysis alone, may have an important reduction on mortality (3.3% vs 3.9%; −5 per 1000; 95% CI: −16 to +10); and has an important reduction on reinfarction (2.6% vs 4.4%; −19 per 1000; 95% CI: −27 to −6), revascularization (9.0% vs 26.8%; −169 per 1000; 95% CI: −220 to −64), and recurrent ischemia (1.2% vs 5.7%; −46 per 1000; 95% CI: −52 to −27) at 30 days follow up. Similar results were found at longest follow up for the outcomes mentioned. PS probably has an important reduction on mean hospital stay length at longest follow up (−2.47 days; 95% CI: −4.17 to −0.78) and may reduce cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock at 30 days, but the evidence is very uncertain. PS has trivial or no effect on major bleeding (4.6% vs 5.0%; −4 per 1000; 95% CI: −17 to +13) and may have an important reduction on stroke (0.7% vs 1.3%; −6 per 1000: 95 CI: −10 to +2). Conclusions The PS has an important reduction on reinfarction, revascularization, and recurrent ischemia; probably has an important reduction on mean hospital stay length; and may have an important reduction of mortality and stroke.

{"id":"science_plos_one_25a129e569c5","title":"The impact of international megaproject social responsibility on satisfaction with the environmental compensation mechanism: The role of stakeholder participation","content":"by Zixuan Zeng, Yongtao Shen, Jijun Yang, Thammanoon Hengsadeekul Background Construction projects, particularly megaprojects, inherently entail substantial environmental and social challenges. Early research on megaproject social responsibility (MSR) has primarily focused on domestic contexts, such as China, and has explored resident satisfaction mainly through economic or policy lenses. However, these studies have paid limited attention to broader stakeholders, leaving a significant gap in understanding how MSR influences satisfaction with the environmental compensation mechanism (SECM), particularly in international settings. This study aims to fill this gap by examining how MSR at different stages of the project life cycle affects SECM and by analyzing the mediating role of stakeholder environmental activities participation (SEAP) in this relationship. The findings provide theoretical and empirical insights to enhance the design and implementation of environmental compensation in international megaprojects, thereby contributing to improved stakeholder satisfaction and sustainable development outcomes. Methods Grounded in life-cycle and stakeholder theories, this study investigated large-scale projects involving Chinese contractors in Thailand. We employed a two-stage questionnaire survey, beginning with a pilot study (n = 204) to validate the scales, followed by a main study (n = 398) for final analysis. Data were analyzed using factor analysis, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression. Results The results indicate that MSR has a significant positive effect on host-country residents’ satisfaction with the environmental compensation mechanism (SECM), with direct effects notably originating from the design and operational stages. Furthermore, stakeholder environmental activities participation (SEAP) partially mediates the relationship between MSR (across all its stages) and SECM.

This study investigates how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to SIMD by examining metabolic changes in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts exposed to varying concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin, to enhance our understanding of the relationship between infection severity and metabolic responses. H9c2 cells were treated with LPS at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 µg/mL for 24 or 48 hours. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay, and gene expression related to inflammation and mitochondrial function was analyzed through Real-Time PCR. Mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism were assessed using the Seahorse MitoStress kit. Results showed that while 2.5 and 5 µg/mL of LPS for 24 hours did not significantly impact cell viability, exposure to 5 µg/mL for 48 hours led to a 77.7% decrease in survival. Gene analysis indicated significant overexpression of IL-6 and SOD2, with consistent underexpression of mt-ND1. Mitochondrial respiration increased at lower LPS concentrations but decreased at 5 µg/mL. Glycolytic metabolism also increased at lower LPS levels but decreased at higher concentrations. Inhibition of metabolic pathways affected mitochondrial function, especially at higher LPS concentrations. Our findings suggest that LPS induces metabolic disturbances in H9c2 cells, with adaptive responses at lower concentrations. However, excessive exposure results in mitochondrial and cellular damage, decreasing overall metabolism.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334234","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.582596","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Karelle Léon","raw_content_length":1803,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MTT","Real-Time PCR","LPS"],"persons":["Karine Pichavant-Rafini","Marie","Michaël Théron","Amandine Szczesnowski","Karelle Léon Sepsis"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1774,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["metabolic changes","H9c2 cardiomyoblasts","LPS","sepsis mechanisms","SIMD","Amandine Szczesnowski","Karine Pichavant-Rafini","Marie-Dominique Jezequel","Michaël Théron","Karelle Léon Sepsis"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"metabolic changes":3.0,"H9c2 cardiomyoblasts":3.0,"LPS":3.0,"sepsis mechanisms":2.0,"SIMD":2.0,"Amandine Szczesnowski":1.0,"Karine Pichavant-Rafini":1.0,"Marie-Dominique Jezequel":1.0,"Michaël Théron":1.0,"Karelle Léon Sepsis":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744189672777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.452,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7096,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0277,"joy":0.0024,"surprise":0.0032,"sadness":0.024,"fear":0.9215,"anger":0.0137,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.8,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Metabolic changes in cells under stress","Impact of LPS on mitochondrial function","Gene expression analysis in response to LPS"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Can be used as an example of cellular response to stress in energy-related contexts (e.g., biofuel production, bio-reactors).","hands_on_opportunities":"Lab setup for cell culture and metabolic analysis."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study investigates the metabolic response of heart cells to bacterial infection, revealing mitochondrial dysfunction under stress.

Bruins, Linda Eijkelkamp-Biesterbos, Annemiek M. Meutstege, Claudy Oliveira dos Santos Background General practice patients with an acute urinary tract infection are usually treated empirically. Urine is only cultured if initial therapy fails. This study aimed to assess whether resistance rates of Escherichia coli (E. coli) from initial urine samples differ from those observed after treatment failure, and whether current surveillance data used for treatment guidelines may overestimate resistance in first-line care. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted from October 2022 to June 2024 at Isala Hospital in Zwolle, the Netherlands, involving patients from two general practices. Patients with suspected acute UTI were included, excluding those with indwelling catheters. Initial urine samples were cultured, and resistance rates for all E. coli strains isolated were compared with data from the Dutch national AMR database ISIS-AR and regional data. Treatment success or failure was evaluated by recording the prescribed antibiotics and follow-up visits within 28 days. Results A total of 366 urine samples from 272 patients were analyzed. E. coli was the most common pathogen (82.2%). Resistance rates for E. coli were lower than those reported in national and regional datasets. Empirical treatment success rates were 95% for nitrofurantoin, 90% for fosfomycin, 92% for ciprofloxacin, and 100% for trimethoprim. Repeat cultures were performed in 19 cases due to persistent symptoms. Conclusion The study confirms that the Dutch national guideline for empirical UTI treatment in general practice is effective. However, periodic reviews of resistance rates for common uropathogens are recommended to ensure continued guideline validity and promote responsible antibiotic use.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334222","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.583583","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Claudy Oliveira dos Santos","raw_content_length":1880,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Isala Hospital","Santos Background","UTI"],"persons":["Linda Eijkelkamp-Biesterbos","Claudy Oliveira","Marjan J.

Albers, Jaap van Weeghel, Diana P.K. Roeg Background Financial stability is essential for well-being, influencing health, housing, education, and social participation. Individuals with mental illness often face financial hardship, including debt, financial administration problems, and limited access to basic needs. Despite its importance, little research exists on factors supporting financial self-management for this group. This study explores financial hardship experiences, causes, and support mechanisms among clients in supported accommodation in the Netherlands. Methods Twenty-seven clients were recruited via staff of a large supported accommodation setting in the Netherlands, of which 22% received residential support and 48% received floating outreach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and thematic analysis was used to interpret participants’ lived experiences with financial problems. Results Participants identified several causes for their financial struggles, including psychological issues, impulsive spending, and a lack of financial literacy. Relationship problems (e.g., divorce) and limited social support also were mentioned to contribute to ongoing financial hardship. Budget coaches, professionals with expertise in debt management, offer personalized guidance and practical assistance with financial management, including creating budgets, managing expenses, and addressing debts. This support was highly valued by clients, helping them to organize their finances, manage expenses, reduce stress, and develop their financial literacy. Conclusions This study highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of financial difficulties experienced by clients in supported accommodation. Budget coaches, with their specialized knowledge of the target population and financial expertise, can play a crucial role in improving the financial situation of individuals with mental illness. The findings underscore the need for integrated support addressing both financial and mental health challenges to promote long-term independence and well-being for this vulnerable population in the Netherlands.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334211","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.584143","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":278,"author":"Diana P.K.

Hence, this study aimed to develop a brief form of the Chinese version of the Odor Awareness Scale(OAS-B) with sufficient psychometric properties. Materials and methods A total of 978 participants from a college were recruited, who were randomly allocated into two groups for item reduction(N = 492) and scale validation(N = 486). Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to remove items identified as information overlaps. After removing overlapping items, the brief scale was validated in the other subgroup for reliability and validity. The criterion-related validity was measured by correlation analysis between OAS-B and the Social Odor Awareness Scale(SOS), the Body Odor Sniffing Questionnaire(BOSQ), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Results Removing 12 overlapping items, OAS-B holds 15 items with three subscales. The model fit indices for the OAS-B were: χ2/df = 2.594, RMSEA = 0.057, CFI = 0.938, TLI = 0.925, SRMR = 0.046. The Cronbach’s α coefficient for OAS-B was 0. 868. The Pearson correlations between OAS-B and SOS, BOSQ, and GAD-7 were 0.518 (p < 0.01), 0.410 (p < 0.01) and 0.165 (p < 0.01). Conclusion OAS-B has a short length with sufficient psychometric properties, which could be applied to measure odor awareness in general population.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334168","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.584767","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Guanghui Nie","raw_content_length":1699,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.29,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Odor Awareness Scale(OAS","the Odor Awareness Scale(OAS-B"],"persons":["Hao Xu","Shuling Huang","Xiuxia Li","Binfeng Zhang","Lu Wang","Mei He","Shanggang Huang","Guanghui Nie","Lei Cao"],"locations":["reduction(N"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1643,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Chinese version","a brief form","Development","the Odor Awareness ScaleOAS","Binfeng Zhang","Xiuxia Li","Mei He","Shanggang Huang","Shuling Huang","Lu Wang"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Chinese version":4.0,"a brief form":3.0,"Development":2.0,"the Odor Awareness ScaleOAS":2.0,"Binfeng Zhang":1.0,"Xiuxia Li":1.0,"Mei He":1.0,"Shanggang Huang":1.0,"Shuling Huang":1.0,"Lu Wang":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744245754166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.7075,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4585,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8447,"joy":0.0089,"surprise":0.0279,"sadness":0.0232,"fear":0.0215,"anger":0.0191,"disgust":0.0547},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.4,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Odor awareness and its impact on energy consumption behavior","Correlation between odor sensitivity and acceptance of renewable energy technologies (e.g., biogas plants)"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Can be used as a case study in environmental psychology or behavioral economics courses to understand how sensory perception influences decision-making related to energy consumption and sustainability.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article details the development of a brief and psychometrically sound Odor Awareness Scale (OAS-B) for assessing individual differences in odor awareness.

{"id":"science_plos_one_b952c2cbca1b","title":"A qualitative examination of football players’ acceptability and perceptions on the use of virtual reality in football training","content":"by Anna U. Shields, David L. Neumann, Matthew J. Stainer Introduction Virtual reality (VR) technologies are being increasingly used for training among football teams. Despite this, limited research has examined football players’ acceptability and perceptions of VR training. It is essential to understand football players’ perspectives on this training approach to identify any psychological factors that may influence its uptake. Methods A qualitative approach was adopted to explore footballers’ acceptability and perceptions of VR in training. Fourteen professional and semi-professional football players completed a survey and took part in qualitative semi-structured interviews between May and October 2023. All participants were asked questions about their perspectives of the benefits and barriers of using VR for football training. The interview data was recorded and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Themes regarding the footballers’ acceptability were interpreted within the framework of the Technology Acceptance Model. Overall, the footballers demonstrated acceptability and emphasised its potential usefulness in football training. Footballers perceived VR as being beneficial for cognitive and perceptual-motor skill training, mental preparation and pressure training through exposure to representative game-like environments, as well as providing greater training flexibility. Alongside these benefits, factors which could hinder optimal uptake were identified, including lack of accessibility, financial costs, and perceptual differences between the VR environments and the real-world. Conclusion The present study provides insight into experienced football players’ acceptability and perceptions of VR for training and suggest that VR training has potential to be accepted by football players, particularly when it is promoted to them as a flexible approach that can enhance their on-field performance.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334167","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.585320","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Matthew J.

This study determined the clinical and pathological profile and survival in children with PM-RMS treated at a single tertiary cancer treatment facility in Uganda. Methods This was a retrospective study involving a review of records of children and adolescents aged below 18 years with rhabdomyosarcoma treated at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) between January 2016 and December 2020. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox’s proportional hazards model were used for five-year survival analysis. Results We identified 32 PM-RMS cases with a median age of 4.8 years (range 1–15 years). The most common tumor sites were the infratemporal region (25.0%), middle ear (21.8%), and nasopharynx (18.8%). Most patients (90.6%) were IRS group III, and 34.4% had regional lymph node involvement. Embryonal and alveolar histologies represented 46.9% and 21.8%, respectively, with 31.3% unclassified. Nearly all patients (90.6%) received chemotherapy, but only 43.8% underwent radiotherapy for local control. One- and five-year overall survival rates were 65% and 12%, respectively. Regional nodal involvement and receipt of local control were the significant predictors of survival (adjusted HR 4.61 and 6.07, respectively). Conclusion Our study demonstrates a low survival rate among children with PM-RMS among the patient cohort, and treatment abandonment remains high. Regional nodal involvement and local control significantly predicted survival.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334140","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.585836","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Jaques van Heerden","raw_content_length":1802,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Clinicopathological","Kaplan-Meier","UCI","the Uganda Cancer Institute"],"persons":["Racheal Angom","Jaques van Heerden Background","Fadhil Geriga","Richard Nyeko","Cox","Joyce Balagadde Kambugu"],"locations":["Uganda"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1767,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["survival","children","Clinicopathological profile","parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma","resource","PM-RMS","Richard Nyeko","Fadhil Geriga","Racheal Angom","Joyce Balagadde Kambugu"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"survival":3.0,"children":3.0,"Clinicopathological profile":2.0,"parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma":2.0,"resource":2.0,"PM-RMS":2.0,"Richard Nyeko":1.0,"Fadhil Geriga":1.0,"Racheal Angom":1.0,"Joyce Balagadde Kambugu":1.0}},"age_hours":4.74427647,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.414,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0828,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8481,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0508,"sadness":0.0204,"fear":0.0439,"anger":0.0083,"disgust":0.0184},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":1},"seece_relevance_score":2.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"none"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI)","country":"Uganda","collaboration_type":"Clinical Research"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of factors affecting radiotherapy access in LMICs","Development of predictive models for PM-RMS survival in resource-constrained settings"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of challenges in healthcare access and resource allocation in developing countries, highlighting the importance of sustainable healthcare solutions.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study analyzes the survival rates of children with parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma (PM-RMS) in Uganda, highlighting the impact of regional nodal involvement and local control on survival.

Its ability to form biofilm provides an additional trait to evade antibiotics. Biofilm-associated infections are difficult to treat, raising the need for alternative strategies. Thus, this research aimed to investigate the potential of bacteriophage to disrupt the biofilm produced by P. aeruginosa isolated from wound infections. Wound samples were collected aseptically, processed for the isolation of P. aeruginosa, and identified by standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Bacteriophages were isolated using the double-layer agar method. Phenotypic assessment of biofilm formation by the isolates and its reduction by phages was conducted by the tissue culture plate assay. Out of 647 wound samples processed, 96 P. aeruginosa were isolated. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most effective antibiotic, while doxycycline was the least effective. Among the total isolates, 86 (89.6%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 69 (71.9%) were biofilm producers. Three different phages isolated from sewage demonstrated a high specificity to P. aeruginosa. Of these, phage vB_PaeP_PS2 lysed the highest number of isolates (22.9%), including 17 MDR and 21 biofilm-producing isolates. The biofilm reduction assay demonstrated that phage treatment significantly reduced biofilm formation, with vB_PaeP_PS2 achieving a 58% reduction after 6 h of treatment. In conclusion, this study highlights the high prevalence of biofilm-producing MDR P. aeruginosa in wound infections and, for the first time in Nepal, demonstrates the potential of locally isolated phages to lyse biofilm-forming MDR isolates and disrupt their biofilms.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334139","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.586610","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":263,"author":"Reshma Tuladhar","raw_content_length":1993,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.315,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Antimicrobial","Kirby-Bauer"],"persons":["Tuladhar Pseudomonas","Jivan Shakya","Manisha Shrestha","Shrestha","Tandukar","Anup Subedee"],"locations":["Sanjit Shrestha","Padma"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1936,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bacteriophage","an anti","Padma Shrestha","Sujit Tandukar","Manisha Shrestha","Sanjit Shrestha","Anup Subedee","Jivan Shakya","Reshma Tuladhar Pseudomonas aeruginosa","an opportunistic pathogen"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bacteriophage":2.0,"an anti":2.0,"Padma Shrestha":1.0,"Sujit Tandukar":1.0,"Manisha Shrestha":1.0,"Sanjit Shrestha":1.0,"Anup Subedee":1.0,"Jivan Shakya":1.0,"Reshma Tuladhar Pseudomonas aeruginosa":1.0,"an opportunistic pathogen":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744291156944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.778,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.008,"sadness":0.0216,"fear":0.0661,"anger":0.0404,"disgust":0.078},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Bacteriophage application for biofilm disruption in industrial settings","Optimization of phage treatment for MDR bacteria in wastewater treatment plants"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of biological solution to combat antibiotic resistance, relevant to industrial processes.","hands_on_opportunities":"Lab work on phage isolation and biofilm reduction assays."},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This research investigates the use of bacteriophages to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* biofilms, a common problem in wound infections.

{"id":"science_plos_one_3015635da3a1","title":"Cultural adaptation and validation of the short food literacy questionnaire (SFLQ) for adults in Lebanon","content":"by Sahar Obeid, Souheil Hallit, Feten Fekih-Romdhane, Marie Hokayem, Ayoub Saeidi, Yonna Sacre, Maha Hoteit Introduction In recent decades, Food Literacy (FL) has gained significant attention in the fields of food and nutrition. It is considered a key determinant of public health and presents a promising approach to addressing health challenges like obesity and environmental sustainability. However, Lebanon currently lacks a validated tool to assess food literacy. In this context, the Short Food Literacy Questionnaire (SFLQ) offers potential for translation and cultural adaptation. Adapting an established tool for use in a new cultural setting enables cross-country comparisons and supports the development of cross-cultural study models. Therefore, this study aims to culturally adapt the SFLQ to assess food literacy among Lebanese adults, enhance their knowledge, and promote healthier lifestyle habits. Methods A nationally representative sample of 450 adults was selected through probability cluster sampling from the eight Lebanese governorates. The SFLQ was administered between 11 December 2022 and 23 March 2023 to evaluate participants’ food literacy. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted using SPSS AMOS version 30, applying the maximum likelihood estimation method to obtain parameter estimates. Results The average age of the participants was 46.0 years, with women making up 59.0% of the sample. The one-factor model showed an acceptable fit after accounting for correlated residuals between items 4−5, 9−10 and 11−12 (RMSEA = 0.079 (90% CI 0.068, 0.091), SRMR = 0.053, CFI = 0.935, TLI = 0.916). Internal consistency was satisfactory (ω = .86/ α = .86). Measurement invariance across gender was confirmed at the configural, metric and scalar levels. Males had significantly higher average SFLQ scores than females (32.80 ± 7.91 vs 28.76 ± 9.26; p < 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.486).

Methods Sixty-six patients with ischemic stroke were divided into BFR (30% one-repetition maximum [1RM]), matched LL, or HL (80% 1RM) groups. Patients underwent a four-week supervised cycling program, and oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentrations were assessed during the first session and after the program via functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Muscle performance was characterized by the rectus femoris muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), knee extensor peak torque (PT), and Fugl–Meyer lower extremity (FMLE) scores. Results Compared with the LL group, the BFR and HL groups presented significant brain activation (increased HbO concentration) during the first session (P < 0.05). Following the 4-week intervention, the BFR and HL groups presented greater changes in the HbO concentration (ΔHbO), PT and FMLE scores than did the LL group (P < 0.05). The ΔHbO values in the primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (PMC-SMA) of the affected hemisphere (AH) were considerably greater than those in the unaffected hemisphere (P < 0.05), whereas there was no difference in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

Vicia faba seeds are traditionally used in Ethiopia for gastric ulcers and gastritis, but scientific evidence is lacking. Seeds were extracted with 80% hydro-methanol to evaluate its antiulcer effect, and part of the extract was fractionated into n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and aqueous solvents. The antiulcer activity of the crude extract and solvent fractions was tested using pylorus ligation and ethanol-induced ulcer models. Repeated dose studies were also performed on both models. In a pylorus ligation-induced ulcer model, single-dose studies showed that 200 mg/kg significantly reduced ulcer number, score (P < 0.05), and index (P < 0.01), providing 39.83% protection. The 400 mg/kg, significantly reduced ulcer number, and score (P < 0.01), providing 55.80% protection. In a repeated-dose study, 100 mg/kg significantly reduced ulcer number and score (P < 0.05). The 200 mg/kg dose showed stronger effects (P < 0.01, for the above parameters, respectively). The highest dose (400 mg/kg) significantly reduced ulcer parameters (P < 0.001) and also lowered gastric juice volume (P < 0.01), acidity (P < 0.05), and raised pH (P < 0.01), providing 59.17% protection. In the ethanol-induced ulcer model, single-dose crude extract provided an ulcer index protection of 23.39%, 34.90%, and 54.04% at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, respectively. Repeated administration of the crude extract increased ulcer protection to 34.94%, 50.91%, and 65.72% at the same respective doses. All doses of the aqueous and the ethyl acetate fractions also showed antiulcer activity.

Mweene, Situmbeko Liweleya, Sydney Mulamfu, Benson M. Hamooya, Sepiso K. Masenga Background Children living with perinatally-acquired HIV-1 (CPHIV) face significant health challenges despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study aimed to determine the association between unsuppressed HIV RNA viral load (VL), proinflammatory markers, sociodemographic, and clinical factors among CPHIV attending routine ART clinic at Arthur Davison Children’s Hospital (ADH), Ndola, Zambia. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study on 135 CPHIV, aged 2−18 years, who had been on ART for over 12 months. Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and a data collection form. The primary outcome was unsuppressed HIV RNA VL defined as a viral load greater than 1000 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA after at least 6 months of ART treatment. Bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted to assess associations with unsuppressed HIV viral load. Results Overall median (Q1 - Q3) age was 15 years (12–17) and 59.3% were male. The proportion of CPHIV with unsuppressed HIV VL was 15.6% (n = 21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.9–22.8%). Factors associated with unsuppressed VL in multivariate logistic regression were poor adherence to ART (missing two or more doses in 2 weeks) (adjusted OR (AOR) = 14.96; 95% CI: 2.39–93.49, p = 0.004) and lower CD4 count (AOR; 0.99, 0.99–1.00, p = 0.026). Proinflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (p = 0.196) and D-dimer (p = 0.709) did not differ between the suppressed and unsuppressed CPHIV. Conclusion One in six children with perinatally acquired HIV in Ndola, Zambia, had unsuppressed viral load, which was associated with poor ART adherence and lower CD4 counts. Proinflammatory markers, TNF-α and D-dimer, showed no significant differences between suppressed and unsuppressed groups, suggesting they may not be reliable indicators of viral control. Enhanced adherence support and further research on immune dysregulation are needed.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334109","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.589074","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":312,"author":"Sepiso K.

Yet, sedation affects serum cortisol levels; butorphanol elevates cortisol, while dexmedetomidine reduces it dose dependently. Understanding the duration of sedation’s impact on cortisol concentration is important. Hypothesis/objectives To evaluate serum cortisol at time 0 and 6-hours post-administration of intravenous (IV) saline (0.5 mL), butorphanol (0.3 mg/kg) and combination of butorphanol and dexmedetomidine (0.3 mg/kg and 5 µg/kg, respectively). Additionally, to compare post-adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) cortisol concentration at 7 hours after these treatment protocols. Animals 12 healthy, castrated, colony beagles Methods Randomized, controlled, repeated-measure crossover design with a one-week washout between treatments. Serum cortisol was measured at time 0 (T0) and 6-hours (T6) post-IV administration of saline (0.5 mL), butorphanol (0.3 mg/kg), or combination butorphanol and dexmedetomidine (0.3 mg/kg and 5 µg/kg, respectively). An ACTH-stimulation test was performed at 6-hours post-treatments. Cortisol concentrations were compared with a mixed model analysis with treatment and time as fixed factors. Results Mean (± standard deviation) serum cortisol concentration was not significantly different at T0 and T6 following saline (T0 1.47 ± 1.12; T6 0.91 ± 0.29 µg/dL) butorphanol (0.9 ± 0.41; 0.95 ± 0.38 µg/dL) and combination butorphanol and dexmedetomidine (0.96 ± 0.43; 1.62 ± 0.9 µg/dL) (p = 0.29).

Novakowski, Fatima Sheikh, Susan Korstad, Kristin MacDonald, Jordan Sacks, Kristine Russell, Marie-Maxime Bergeron, Marianne Vidler, on behalf of Sepsis Canada Introduction Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with significant long-term impacts for survivors and their families. The known benefits of patient engagement have led to increased efforts globally to involve survivors in sepsis research. This study aimed to characterize the experiences of sepsis survivors and their families in patient advisory councils (PACs) for two Canadian sepsis research networks (Action on Sepsis and Sepsis Canada) and explore how PAC involvement supports long-term recovery. Methods This mixed-methods cross-sectional study consisted of a structured survey, ten interviews, and one focus group discussion. All current members of the Sepsis Canada and Action on Sepsis PACs (n = 29) were invited to participate. The results of the survey were analyzed descriptively and used to inform the development of the semi-structured interview guide. Qualitative data were analyzed using a thematic approach. Results Overall, 16 PAC members participated. The majority of participants were women and over 40 years old. Survey scores showed that most participants felt meaningfully engaged, while the qualitative findings highlighted how PACs supported recovery and fostered community connections between survivors, families, and researchers. Major themes included sepsis experience, recovery journey, characteristics of PACs, characteristics of PAC participation, and impacts of PAC involvement. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that PACs provide critical benefits that extend beyond feeling valued or appreciated for contributing to a specific project. These findings highlight the value of patient-oriented research in shaping evidence-based practices and policies and emphasize the need for trauma-informed approaches and improved post-sepsis care pathways to enhance recovery outcomes.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334057","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.592013","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"on behalf of Sepsis Canada","raw_content_length":2035,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Marie-Maxime Bergeron","Sepsis Canada","PAC","Sepsis Canada Introduction Sepsis","the Sepsis Canada and Action on Sepsis"],"persons":["Mia Sheehan","Fatima Sheikh","Susan Korstad","Kristin MacDonald","Jordan Sacks","Stefanie K.

To this end, a bio-recycling agent (BRA) based on waste vegetable oil (WVO) was initially designed for the utilization of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) through the orthogonal test, and then its physical-chemical and permeating properties were analyzed by a series of tests. Next, the bio-recycled asphalt binder was prepared and its several pavement behaviors were measured via adhesion, rheology and fatigue experiments, thus its recycling efficiency was validated. Ultimately, the microscopic mechanism of bio-recycled asphalt was revealed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and atomic force microscope (AFM) tests. Research results showed that the composition of BRA was determined as base oil components: permeation components: polymer components: functional components = 120: 2: 13: 2.4. Compared to two commercial recycling agents (LBS and HRA), BRA possessed better recycling effect at the same dosage, which obviously restored the adhesion, high- and low-temperature rheological properties and fatigue resistance of aged asphalt, and the BRA increased fatigue life of aged matrix asphalt binder by about 60% compared to LBS at 9% dosage. Moreover, the recycled asphalt with suitable BRA dosage can adapt to a wider range of traffic grades than original asphalt, and for aged matrix and SBS-modified asphalt binder, it was recommended that the reasonable dosage of BRA was 7%−9% and 3%−5%, respectively. The samples recycled by three recycling agents all exhibited favorable thermal stability, and which was basically the same as or higher than that of the original asphalt. Besides, after incorporating the BRA, the number and size of bee-structures in aged asphalt decreased, while the roughness of asphalt surface slightly descended. Meanwhile, compared to two-commercial recycling agents, BRA had a significant improvement on the micro adhesion of aged asphalt, and behaved a better recycling effect on the aged asphalt.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334052","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.592723","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":312,"author":"Zhongnan Tian","raw_content_length":2140,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.56,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DSC","RAP","BRA"],"persons":["Hengbin Liu","Zhengqi Zhang","Ying Fang","Fei Zhou","Zhongnan Tian Mineral"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2132,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Exploration","the bio","Ying Fang","Zhengqi Zhang","Fei Zhou","Hengbin Liu","environmental concerns","the search","sustainable alternatives","this end"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["sustainable alternatives"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Exploration":2.0,"the bio":2.0,"Ying Fang":1.0,"Zhengqi Zhang":1.0,"Fei Zhou":1.0,"Hengbin Liu":1.0,"environmental concerns":1.0,"the search":1.0,"sustainable alternatives":1.0,"this end":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744429874444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5699,"joy":0.0099,"surprise":0.0056,"sadness":0.0195,"fear":0.1333,"anger":0.0857,"disgust":0.1761},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":7,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":8,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":7,"applied_research_fit":7,"regional_impact_potential":5},"seece_relevance_score":6.6,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":true,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":true},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"LBS","country":"Unknown","role":"Commercial recycling agent"},{"name":"HRA","country":"Unknown","role":"Commercial recycling agent"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Optimization of bio-recycling agent composition for specific asphalt types","Life cycle assessment of bio-recycled asphalt compared to mineral oil-based alternatives","Performance evaluation of bio-recycled asphalt in Dutch climate conditions"],"internship_potential":true,"curriculum_integration":"Material science, pavement engineering, sustainable construction","hands_on_opportunities":"Lab testing of asphalt properties, analysis of microscopic structures"},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article explores a bio-recycling agent (BRA) derived from waste vegetable oil for asphalt recycling, demonstrating improved performance compared to commercial alternatives.

In this study, the correlation between the oxidative balance score (OBS) and CKM syndrome was investigated, along with the underlying mechanisms involved. Methods and results The study data were obtained from participants with complete OBS and diagnostic information on CKM syndrome in the NHANES from 1999 to 2018. The correlation between OBS and the incidence of CKM syndrome was investigated by weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis. Mediation analyses were conducted to explore the mediating role of inflammatory markers in the relationship between these two variables. A restricted cubic spline graph and threshold effects were constructed to identify nonlinear associations. OBS was applied to eight machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model and assess its performance. A total of 30113 participants were included in our study. OBS was negatively correlated with CKM syndrome regardless of covariate adjustment. Compared with the lowest quartile of OBS, the highest quartile resulted in a 33% decrease in the incidence of CKM syndrome. A nonlinear association was identified using a restricted cubic spline, with 30 being the threshold point. Mediation analysis indicated that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and systemic immune inflammation (SII) partially inﬂuenced the relationship between these two parameters. Among the eight machine learning algorithms, XGBoost presented the highest area under the curve (AUC), demonstrating superior predictive performance and clinical efficacy. Conclusions The prevalence of CKM syndrome was negatively correlated with an increase in OBS, which may be partially related to its anti-inflammatory effect.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334050","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.593242","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Haoting He","raw_content_length":1966,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NHANES","CKM","associatio","OBS"],"persons":["Li Rong","Xin Liu"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1938,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the oxidative balance score","Impact","cardiovascular-kidney","Xin Liu","Li Rong","Haoting He Background","The antioxidant diet","lifestyle","various diseases","their applicability"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the oxidative balance score":3.0,"Impact":2.0,"cardiovascular-kidney":2.0,"Xin Liu":1.0,"Li Rong":1.0,"Haoting He Background":1.0,"The antioxidant diet":1.0,"lifestyle":1.0,"various diseases":1.0,"their applicability":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744444665555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7418,"joy":0.0695,"surprise":0.0633,"sadness":0.0372,"fear":0.0282,"anger":0.0439,"disgust":0.0162},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":true,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":5,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.5,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Correlation of oxidative balance score with specific Dutch dietary habits and CKM syndrome incidence.","Impact of anti-inflammatory diets on energy levels and productivity in Dutch industrial settings."],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Example of using machine learning for predictive health modeling based on lifestyle factors.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study investigates the correlation between oxidative balance score (OBS) and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, finding a negative correlation.

Although this bacterium is well studied in livestock and poultry, studies of camelid infections caused by extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are limited. In this study, a set of ExPEC from camel carcasses (n = 150) was characterized with respect to phylogenetic groups, 162 O serotypes, and 35 virulence-associated genes (VAGs) using PCR screening. ExPEC frequently belonged to phylogroup B1 (58.7%), followed by phylogroups C, A, and B2 (12.7%, 12.0%, and 9.3%, respectively). Additionally, the set of ExPEC contained 36 different serotypes. The ExPEC isolates were found to typically encode ≥5 tested VAGs, particularly those related to adhesion (afaI, fimA, pap, sfa, tsh), iron acquisition (fyuA, iroN, iucC, sitA), host cell damage (α-hly, cdt, cnf1, sat), invasion (ibeA), and bacterial protection (iss, ompT, traT). Moreover, ExPEC from camel adults and calves were different from each other. Among isolates from calves, prevalence was significantly higher for phylogroups C (q < 0.001) and E (q < 0.01), and ten VAGs, including fitness factors (eitA, fepC, fyuA, iroN, iss, iucD, ompT, sitA), as well as VAGs with stronger link to pathogenicity (hlyF, and pap). To identify potential reservoir of camel ExPEC strains, fecal E. coli (n = 139) from healthy camels were also analyzed. Based on the identified characteristics, ExPEC were distinguishable from fecal isolates of healthy camels, suggesting an exogenous source of ExPEC infections, likely transmitted from wild birds and human keepers.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334045","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:38:55.594662","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Juraj Bosák","raw_content_length":1942,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.29,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ExPEC"],"persons":["Juraj Bosák","Joseph","Ulrich Wernery","Martina Florianová","Helena Juřicová","fimA","David Šmajs","Matěj Hrala"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1724,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["camel carcasses","Escherichia colii","Phylogroups","serotypes","markers","virulence","ExPEC","Matěj Hrala","Marina Joseph","Martina Florianová"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"camel carcasses":3.0,"Escherichia colii":2.0,"Phylogroups":2.0,"serotypes":2.0,"markers":2.0,"virulence":2.0,"ExPEC":2.0,"Matěj Hrala":1.0,"Marina Joseph":1.0,"Martina Florianová":1.0}},"age_hours":4.744462696666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.742,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1458,"joy":0.0039,"surprise":0.0051,"sadness":0.0316,"fear":0.117,"anger":0.0793,"disgust":0.6172},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.9,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[{"name":"Matěj Hrala, Marina Joseph, Martina Florianová, Helena Juřicová, David Šmajs, Juraj Bosák","country":"Czech Republic","collaboration_type":"Research"},{"name":"Ulrich Wernery","country":"UAE","collaboration_type":"Research"}],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of virulence factors in E. coli strains","Comparative genomics of ExPEC isolates from different sources","Development of rapid detection methods for ExPEC in animal carcasses"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Microbiology and veterinary science courses could use this as a case study.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study characterizes extraintestinal pathogenic *E. coli* (ExPEC) from camel carcasses, identifying virulence factors and phylogenetic groups.

Disruptions in the ion transporters regulating Ca2+ influx and efflux are clearly linked to seizure disorders and age-related neurodegenerative disease. Yet, the specific contributions of variants in genes encoding these transporters to neurological disease remain to be fully understood. Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a powerful genetic model for uncovering such mechanisms, particularly through studies of mutants that display temperature-sensitive (TS) behavioral phenotypes. In a forward genetic screen, we identified a mutant line that exhibited TS convulsions along with progressive, age-dependent neurodegeneration. We mapped the mutation to Nckx30c, specifically within the transmembrane ion-binding region of this K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Characterization of this mutant, together with a second Nckx30c allele, revealed TS convulsions, impaired locomotion, a markedly shortened lifespan, neurodegeneration with age, along with structural defects at larval and adult neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Gene expression analysis confirmed that Nckx30c levels were reduced in heads of Nckx30c loss-of-function mutants. Tissue-specific manipulation revealed that knockdown of Nckx30c in neurons recapitulated the TS convulsions, locomotor defects, and shortened lifespan phenotypes. Drosophila Nckx30c is highly conserved and shares homology with mammalian SLC24A2, a solute carrier family 24 member whose neurological role is not yet fully elucidated. Our work establishes Nckx30c as an essential regulator of neuronal health and provides an in vivo framework for investigating the contribution of SLC24A2 to neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis, seizures and age-related neurodegeneration.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681163v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.304975","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Majlish, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_fab0dc4e554d","title":"Distinct contributions of anterior and posterior orbitofrontal cortex to outcome","content":"The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for flexibly adjusting choices when outcome values change. Anterior and posterior parts of the human lateral OFC differ in cytoarchitecture and connectivity, but whether these subregions make differential contributions to outcome-guided (i.e., goal-directed) behavior remains unclear. Outcome-guided behavior requires (a) representations of stimulus-outcome associations and (b) inferring the current value of options when making decisions. Here, we test whether these two functions are differentially supported by the posterior (pOFC) and anterior (aOFC) parts of the lateral OFC, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to selectively disrupt activity in functional networks centered on the pOFC and aOFC during a two-day outcome devaluation task. Participants (n = 48) received pOFC or aOFC network-targeted TMS either on day 1 before learning associations between visual stimuli and sweet or savory food odors, or on day 2 before a meal that selectively devalued one of these outcomes, followed by a choice test. TMS targeting pOFC, but not aOFC, before the meal on day 2 disrupted outcome-guided behavior, as measured by choices of stimuli predicting non-sated rewards in the post-meal choice test. In contrast, TMS targeting aOFC, but not pOFC, before learning on day 1 similarly impaired behavior in the post-meal choice test on day 2. These findings demonstrate that anterior and posterior parts of the lateral OFC make distinct contributions to outcome-guided behavior by supporting learning of stimulus-outcome associations and inferring the current value of options, respectively.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681180v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.305302","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Liu, Q., Porter, D., Damra, H., Zhao, Y., Voss, J.

While the reaching task is specified at the endpoint, such task objectives become implicit at the level of joints. A fundamental question is whether planning and control of joints is solely in the service of the endpoint or whether they also include joint trajectories. Using Spearmans correlation and zero crossings, we found differential kinematic signatures of control between shoulder and elbow joints in contrast to the wrist joint. However, the extent of control among joints was substantially diminished compared to the endpoint. Further, when such control measures were compared to the subspaces of inter-trial joint exploration, we found that online control at proximal joints, such as the shoulder and elbow, were significantly associated in regulating the task space, while control at the wrist (distal) joint was associated in regulating joint redundancy in null space. These results suggest that null space is not entirely uncontrolled as per the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis but selectively controlled by some distal joints. Additionally, across different directions, either the shoulder or the elbow contributed dominantly towards the movement of the endpoint while the other joint was lagging and that this strategy reflected in our kinematic measures of online and trajectory control. Taken together, this study shows how the selective implementation of a leading joint in task space and a lagging joint in null space can enable the control of multi-jointed movements and attenuate the problem of joint redundancy.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681178v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.305608","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Chakrabhavi, N., Ghosal, A., Murthy, A.","raw_content_length":1609,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Normative"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1609,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Differential kinematic control","the endpoint","joints","control","Normative upper limb movements","multiple redundant joints","the reaching task","such task objectives","the level","A fundamental question"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["control"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Differential kinematic control":2.0,"the endpoint":2.0,"joints":2.0,"control":2.0,"Normative upper limb movements":1.0,"multiple redundant joints":1.0,"the reaching task":1.0,"such task objectives":1.0,"the level":1.0,"A fundamental question":1.0}},"age_hours":18.745622733055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9279,"joy":0.0019,"surprise":0.0121,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0087,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0281},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.8,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of differential kinematic control in robotic arms","Exploration of joint redundancy in robotic systems","Development of control strategies for multi-jointed movements"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"This research could be used as a case study in robotics and control systems courses.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article explores the control mechanisms of multi-jointed movements, specifically focusing on the differential kinematic signatures between shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints.

Outcomes were assessed using live imaging, immunostaining, and RNA sequencing. Cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and spontaneous calcium transients declined as injury severity increased. At moderate injury severity, the decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium dynamics were temporary. The spatial distribution of Piezo1 also changed temporarily after injury. RNA sequencing identified 196 genes that changed expression after injury, including downregulation of mitochondrial and oxidative metabolic processes and upregulation of cortical thinning pathways.

Most previous work pertaining to neural signatures of exploration is restricted to functional pathways. However, the specific contributions of cortical microarchitectures to high-level cognitive processes such as decision-making are as yet unknown. Here, we investigated the neuroanatomical foundations of inter-individual variability in decision-making strategies. To this end, 122 healthy participants completed a gamified multi-armed bandit paradigm aimed at teasing apart distinct exploration-exploitation decision strategies. We also collected whole-brain quantitative MRI maps indexing microstructural features of cortical myelination and iron content. Through computational modelling, we disentangled individual-specific exploration strategies, including value-free random exploration. Whole-brain regression analyses identified significant associations between value-free exploration and increased cortical myelination in right frontal brain areas with reported links to impulsivity. By elucidating the brain microstructural correlates of distinct exploration-exploitation strategies, we aimed to further our understanding of why individuals differ in their decision-making capabilities, and how decision-making may become aberrant in mental health conditions.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681181v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.306187","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Tyrer, A., Nikolova, N., Dubois, M., Banellis, L., Vejlo, M., Hauser, T.

Using the adenine-induced chronic kidney injury (AdKI) murine model, we identified that AdKI induces dysregulated glucose metabolism in bones and kidneys via in vivo and ex vivo metabolic tracing. Ex vivo 13C-metabolic tracing of osteocyte-enriched femora revealed accelerated citrate production from [1,2-13C]-glucose and [U-13C]-glutamine in AdKI mice. These metabolic changes were observed together with increased circulating citrate and Slc13a5 overexpression in bones from AdKI mice. Thus, to explore the role of citrate in AdKI, we utilized mice harboring a loss of function mutation in the citrate importer SLC13A5 (Slc13a5R337*/R337*). Mutant mice displayed elevated osteocytic citrate production, and elevated circulating citrate, without significantly worsened AdKI-related bone loss. Coincident with this, Slc13a5R337*/R337* mutant mice were significantly protected from loss of kidney function with attenuated AdKI-induced nephrolithiasis. We also confirmed that Slc13a5 is highly expressed in cortical bone compared to the kidney, suggesting the effect of the mutation is mediated by SLC13A5's function outside the kidney. Altogether, this study finds that accelerated osteocytic citrate production in CKD is associated with protection of kidney function, and modulation of citrate handling may be a site for therapeutic intervention in CKD.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681058v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.306467","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Har, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_71423ada6c71","title":"CROP2, a Retriever","content":"Endosomes generate tubulo-vesicular carriers to redistribute proteins between plasma membrane, Golgi, and lysosomes. These transport routes employ distinct combinations of sorting nexins with complexes such as Retromer or Retriever. We now show that, while Retromer associates with the PROPPIN WIPI1 to form the previously described CROP complex, Retriever associates with WIPI2, forming CROP2. WIPI2 integrates into Retriever-dependent coat complexes, since it interacts both with the Commander subunit CCDC93 and its cognate sorting nexin SNX17. CROP and CROP2 are exclusive in their physical associations and pathway selective. Whereas CROP2 is required for endosomal exit of {beta}1-Integrin, it does not affect CROP-dependent cargos, such as EGFR or GLUT1. Vice versa, CROP is not required for {beta}1-Integrin trafficking. WIPI1 and WIPI2 rely on similar molecular features. They use the same FSSS motif to bind to Retromer and Retriever, respectively, and an amphipathic membrane-inserting a-helix, which conveys membrane fission activity to PROPPINs. This suggests that Retromer and Retriever coats integrate distinct PROPPIN isoforms to promote fission of the respective endosomal carriers formed by them.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681146v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.307020","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"De Leo, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6c1ce67d9461","title":"Sexual dimorphism in the complete connectome of the Drosophila male central nervous system","content":"Sex differences in behaviour exist across the animal kingdom, typically under strong genetic regulation. In Drosophila, previous work has shown that fruitless and doublesex transcription factors identify neurons driving sexually dimorphic behaviour. However, the organisation of dimorphic neurons into functional circuits remains unclear. We now present the connectome of the entire Drosophila male central nervous system. This contains 166,696 neurons spanning the brain and ventral nerve cord, fully proofread and comprehensively annotated including fruitless and doublesex expression and 11,691 cell types. By comparison with a previous female brain connectome, we provide the first comprehensive description of the differences between male and female brains to synaptic resolution. Of 7,319 cross-matched cell types in the central brain, 114 are dimorphic with an additional 262 male- and 69 female-specific (totalling 3.8% of neurons in males and 1.9% in females). This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or the presence of male-specific arbours on neurons that are otherwise similar between sexes. Numerous circuit switches reroute sensory information to form conserved, antagonistic circuits controlling opposing behaviours.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.680999v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.307301","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Berg, S., Beckett, I.

In the Indian System of Medicine, Ayurveda, a unique method called Ayolepam is described that facilitates efficient iron absorption from its source to the formulation. Punarnavayolepa Choornam (PC), prepared from Boerhavia diffusa L., is one such novel Ayolepam formulation developed by a traditional Ayurveda school of South India, widely used in the clinical management of iron deficiency anaemia. This study aims at scientifically evaluating the Ayolepam technique by assessing the iron binding and bioavailability properties of PC, prepared from the leaves, root and whole plant of B. diffusa, using in-vitro model systems.. Experimental Procedure: The iron content in both raw and processed samples of PC was quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). A simulated in-vitro digestion model employed to assess the release of bioavailable iron from the formulation. Subsequently, iron bioavailability was evaluated using the Caco-2 cell model of human intestinal epithelium following the ferrozine method. Results and Conclusion: PC preparation from leaves, whole plant and roots of B. diffusa, showed significant increase in iron content compared to the raw material. In-vitro digestion studies confirmed the efficient release of bioavailable iron from these formulations, and subsequent Caco-2 cell assays confirmed their iron bioavailability properties. In conclusion, these findings provide a preliminary scientific basis for this novel and unique pharmaceutical design from a traditional school of Ayurveda, supporting its clinical application.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681069v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.307838","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":237,"author":"Nair, J.

A key factor in continued use, relapse risk, and overdose is the severe withdrawal syndrome that accompanies abstinence. Observational studies suggest cannabis may improve outcomes for patients with OUD. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating compound found in cannabis, is being investigated as a potential treatment for OUD. This study investigated whether CBD alleviated withdrawal symptoms in a rat model of opioid dependence. Sprague Dawley rats (N = 100, 50% female) were administered escalating doses of morphine across 10 days (10-50 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily). Following abrupt discontinuation, withdrawal outcomes were evaluated across acute (38-hr) and protracted (up to day 7) timepoints. Rats were treated with pure CBD (10 or 30 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle (sesame oil; 1 mg/ml) daily, beginning 14-hrs after their final morphine or saline injection (n = 8-9 per sex/group). Withdrawal severity was assessed through physical measurements of body weight, food intake, and somatic signs (e.g., body shakes, diarrhea), and pain sensitivity, as well as measurements of anxiety-like behaviors in the protracted phase. Compared to non-dependent controls, morphine-dependent rats had decreased body weight and food intake, showed greater somatic signs, and had increased pain sensitivity that peaked in acute withdrawal (38-hr). Oral CBD did not affect physical symptoms of opioid withdrawal nor protracted anxiety-like behaviors. These data indicate that CBD alone may have limited effectiveness for treating opioid withdrawal. Reports of improved withdrawal symptoms after cannabis use may be attributed to other compounds in cannabis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.680984v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.308145","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Jenkins, B.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_faedcec28266","title":"Long","content":"Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the X-linked Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1). Although the CGG repeat tract is known for instability that has been posited to contribute to clinical heterogeneity, the extent of somatic variation in human brain remains unclear, in part due to the technical limitations of sequencing long tandem repeats. Here, we quantified FMR1 somatic variation in post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with FXTAS (n = 6) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS, n = 2) by applying amplification-free, targeted, long-read sequencing. This approach uncovered remarkable somatic mosaicism in repeat size and methylation in FXTAS, including somatic expansions and contractions which were not resolvable with traditional approaches. For example, in FXTAS, we identified somatic expansions to over 6000 base pairs in length as well as contractions to below the pathogenic range. We also identified unexpected patterns of methylation mosaicism on pre and full mutations. On the other hand, we replicated prior findings suggesting differential CGG expansion on the active X-chromosome in XX females. Finally, we examined the above cohort for expansions in 19 additional disease-associated repeat loci. Remarkably, we identified additional expansions in 5 out of 8 affected individuals, in FXN and RFC1. This work provides new insight into the extensive molecular variation underlying FXTAS in human brain and establishes a framework for studying repeat expansion disorders more broadly, highlighting the potential of long-read sequencing to advance our fundamental understanding of somatic mosaicism of these intractable regions of our genome.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.07.678589v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.308436","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Dischler, A.

A key innovation allowing for widespread study of antigen-specific B cells was the development of fluorescent antigen probes for use with flow cytometry. Initially these studies were mostly focused upon B cells specific for a variety of model antigens, but over the past decade focus has shifted towards the study of B cells specific for antigens from pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and Influenza virus. Importantly however, these types of approaches have been used for hundreds of different antigens and could be used for thousands more. Unfortunately, studies of B cells specific for an antigen of interest are not easily searchable on current publication databases since these assays are often a small portion of a larger publication. To overcome this, we built a searchable database of studies analyzing antigen-specific B cells by flow cytometry using fluorescent antigen probes that is located at www.immunology.virginia.edu/Taylor/Bcell/Database.php. Using this database, we assessed the number of publications per year revealing rapid growth in the use of this approach in recent years. While much of this rapid growth was focused upon the assessment of B cells specific for SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, or Influenza virus, studies assessing B cells specific for hundreds of different antigens derived from numerous microbes, animals, plants, or other sources can be found in the database. Combined, the antigen-specific B cell database was built to facilitate identification of studies assessing these cells and for analysis of the field as a whole.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.680531v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.308728","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":271,"author":"Palani, S., Kong, A.

Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ox levels were measured in 61 healthy controls, 70 Sudden Unexpected Death Infants (38 SIDS, 32 explained deaths). HA and its metabolite tele-methylhistamine (t-MeHA) were analysed in an additional 46 SUDI (34 SIDS, 12 ED) and 42 controls. Immunocytochemistry was performed on hypothalamic tissue from 11 SIDS and 8 ED cases to assess the number of Ox and HA neurons. Results: CSF Ox levels did not differ globally but were relatively higher in deceased infants aged 2-6 months. HA and t-MeHA levels were significantly elevated in both SIDS and ED cases, likely due to postmortem release. Immunohistochemistry showed increased Ox neurons in SIDS compared to EDs, while HA neurons did not differ. Conclusions: Findings suggest increased Ox activity in SIDS especially within the 2-6 month risk window, potentially reflecting repeated stress or hypoxia prior to death, while HA neurons do not appear involved.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.680830v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.309010","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Zhao, Y., Cui, G.-F., Plancoulaine, S., Comajuan, M., Bersault, M., Inocente, C., Hou, Y.-P., Dauvilliers, Y., Manuela, L., Guyon, A., Meyronet, D., Jouvet, A., Kugener, B., Thieux, M., Robert, P., Lin, J.-S., Franco, P.","raw_content_length":1188,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Hypocretin/Orexin","Histaminergic","CSF"],"persons":["Orexinergic Biomarker"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1188,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Quest","a Histaminergic or Orexinergic Biomarker","Sudden Infant Death Syndrome","This study","the role","the HypocretinOrexin Ox","two key regulators","wakefulness","SIDS","a condition"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Quest":2.0,"a Histaminergic or Orexinergic Biomarker":2.0,"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the role":1.0,"the HypocretinOrexin Ox":1.0,"two key regulators":1.0,"wakefulness":1.0,"SIDS":1.0,"a condition":1.0}},"age_hours":18.745815134722225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0875000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7825,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3022,"joy":0.0066,"surprise":0.0725,"sadness":0.0751,"fear":0.5215,"anger":0.0095,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.5,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":true,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Investigating the link between environmental factors and SIDS through biomarkers","Developing non-invasive methods for monitoring Orexin levels in infants","Analyzing the impact of sleep environment on infant arousal responses"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Potential case study in biomedical engineering or data analysis courses.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This study investigates Orexin and Histamine levels in SIDS victims, finding increased Orexin activity in a specific age range.

Because glutamatergic dysregulation has been implicated in both cannabis effects and psychosis vulnerability, we examined whether brain glutamate relates to dimensional symptoms as a function of cannabis use across the psychosis spectrum. Seventy-nine participants--typically developing controls, clinical high-risk individuals, and patients with psychosis--completed dimensional clinical assessments, detailed cannabis surveys, urine toxicology, and ultra-high-field 7T 1HMRS quantification of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) glutamate levels. Linear models assessed the main and interactive effects of ACC glutamate and cannabis use on positive and negative symptoms. Self-reported cannabis use showed strong concordance with urine toxicology. Cannabis use was associated with higher positive and negative symptoms. Independently, higher ACC glutamate predicted greater positive and negative symptoms. Notably, lower glutamate levels were associated with higher positive symptoms in cannabis users. Exploratory analyses suggested interactions for depressive and manic symptoms, indicating that glutamatergic abnormalities may amplify the overall severity of cannabis-related symptoms. Sensitivity analyses revealed lower ACC glutamate in psychosis patients--especially cannabis users--highlighting diagnostic group differences and reinforcing the link between cannabis exposure and glutamatergic dysfunction. These findings implicate ACC glutamatergic dysfunction as a transdiagnostic correlate of symptom burden, particularly in those with psychosis who are cannabis users. Glutamate-targeted interventions and longitudinal designs will be needed to examine causal pathways linking cannabis exposure to psychosis-relevant outcomes.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.07.680987v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.309301","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Roalf, D.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_17855ce553cb","title":"Distinct contributions of memorability and object recognition to the representational goals of the macaque inferior temporal cortex","content":"The primate inferior temporal (IT) cortex, at the apex of the ventral visual stream, encodes information that supports diverse representational goals, from recognizing objects to determining which images are likely to be remembered. Specific artificial neural networks (ANNs), that currently serve as the leading computational hypotheses of ventral stream processing, are typically trained exclusively for object recognition. We asked whether incorporating image memorability as an additional optimization objective could improve ANN-brain alignment. Models optimized for memorability explained additional, non-overlapping variance in IT responses beyond that captured by recognition-optimized networks, indicating that memorability and recognition rely on partly independent dimensions of IT representation. Notably, these models also exhibited fewer non-brain-like units, bringing their representational geometry closer to that of IT. Furthermore, networks jointly optimized for both objectives were more predictive of human memorability than memorability-only models, while maintaining their alignment with human object recognition performance patterns. Together, these findings suggest that IT encodes multiple representational goals and that models trained solely for recognition provide an incomplete account of ventral stream computation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.06.680822v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.309568","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Ziaee, S., Ahuja, R., Muzellec, S., Fide, E., Rosenbaum, R.

In this case study, we discuss the application and outcomes of Multi-Omic Data Analysis, a peer-to-peer learning-based undergraduate bioinformatics course offered by the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology at the University of Southern California. Over eight semesters, a cohort of student instructors taught 2-3 weekly lectures to 107 undergraduate students in the Quantitative Biology Bachelor of Science degree program. Lectures covered a range of topics, including R and Python data analysis, scientific communication, and general research readiness as undergraduate students. We find that bioinformatics education courses structured around peer-to-peer learning have great potential to overcome many of the obstacles to comprehensive undergraduate bioinformatics education, and provide additional benefits related to student cohesion and community.

We genetically investigate SETDB1s role in the epigenetic control of the transition from totipotency to pluripotency-a process demanding precise timing and forward directionality. Through single-embryo total RNA sequencing of 2-cell and 8-cell embryos, we find that Setdb1mat-/+ embryos fail to extinguish 1-cell and 2-cell transient genes?alongside persistent expression of MERVL retroelements and MERVL?driven chimeric transcripts that define the totipotent state in mouse 2-cell embryos. Comparative bioinformatics reveals that SETDB1 acts at MT2 LTRs and MERVL-driven chimeric transcripts, which normally acquire H3K9me3 during early development. The dysregulated targets substantially overlap with DUXBL-responsive genes, indicating a shared regulatory pathway for silencing the 2-cell transcriptional program. We establish maternal SETDB1 as a critical chromatin regulator required to extinguish retroelement-driven totipotency networks and ensure successful preimplantation development.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.07.680892v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.310121","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Zeng, T.-B., Fu, Z., Majewski, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_beec8eb9b2a0","title":"ATM promotes reversed fork processing during DNA interstrand cross","content":"During replication-coupled DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair, fork reversal is thought to enable the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway to resolve the ICL through nucleolytic incisions. Subsequent fork restoration then allows nascent DNA strand extension past the lesion. Although these fork remodeling events are crucial for ICL repair, their regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we use cell-free Xenopus egg extracts to investigate fork dynamics during ICL repair by the FA pathway. We find that the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase is activated concomitantly with fork reversal and promotes resection of the reversed fork intermediate. This resection depends on the coordinated activities of the EXO1 and DNA2 nucleases. Our data indicate that EXO1 initiates 5' to 3' resection of nascent lagging strands in the regressed arm, while DNA2 performs 5' to 3' resection of recessed lagging strands. We further show that the inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) during ICL repair results in ATM hyperactivation, reversed fork over-resection, and formation of aberrant end-joining products, indicating that PP2A counteracts ATM signaling to constrain reversed fork resection. Taken together, this work implicates reversed forks as substrates for ATM activation and reveals a phospho-regulatory circuit that governs reversed fork processing during ICL repair.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.680157v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.310389","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Altshuller, M., MacKrell, V.

One such effector, RidL, is known to inhibit retrograde trafficking by interacting with the retromer complex via its N-terminal domain. Here, we identify a second function of RidL mediated by its C-terminal domain, which directly binds to the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 and related large GTPases. In vitro, RidL reduces Drp1 GTPase activity and disrupts its oligomerization. During infection, RidL localizes to mitochondria, enhances the accumulation of Drp1 and the outer membrane protein Tom20, and impairs mitochondrial dynamics and function. Moreover, in L. pneumophila-infected cells, RidL promotes phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616, leading to Drp1 activation and mitochondrial fragmentation. These findings establish RidL as a bifunctional effector that targets both the retromer complex and Drp1 through distinct domains. By interfering with host mitochondrial dynamics, RidL enables L. pneumophila to remodel host organelles and optimize conditions for intracellular replication.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.07.680855v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.310646","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Katic, A., Vittori, E., Halter, S., Steiner, K., Swart, A.

These nanosized particles carry a diverse cargo and can play key roles in host-pathogen interactions. Here, we investigated the production, composition, and host cell interactions of EVs secreted by the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain N315, one of the most widely studied clinical isolates. To mimic infection, EVs produced from RPMI supplemented with 10% LB were purified by size exclusion chromatography, and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis and electron microscopy. N315 EVs contained a diverse molecular cargo, selectively enriched, and including proteins, lipoproteins, DNA, RNA, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan. Protection assays and confocal microscopy confirmed the intravesicular localization of RNAs and proteins. N315 EVs were recognized by multiple host pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) in human MG-63 cells, located at the cell surface (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6), within endosomes (TLR3, TLR7, TLR4) and in the cytoplasm (NOD2). EV exposure promoted the selective upregulation of these PRRs, activated the NF-{kappa}B and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, and induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1b, IL6, and CXCL8. N315 EVs were internalized via a dynamin-dependent endocytosis mechanism and trafficked to late endosomes, where RNA cargo release occurred. Importantly, inhibition of EVs uptake altered cytokine gene expression, confirming that internalization is required for immunomodulation. This work provides a better understanding of the mechanisms of interaction of S. aureus EVs with host cells and sheds light on the fate of EVs and their cargo once internalized by cells.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.06.680696v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.310953","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Papail, J., Daniel, N., Prado, L., Vassaux, D., Peron, S., Even, C., Lebret, V., Luz, B.

Using a comprehensive cohort with ante-mortem functional neuroimaging and post-mortem molecular data from the same participants, we mapped individual, whole-brain E/I imbalances through biophysical modeling. E/I ratios in regions supporting higher-order cognitive functions were significantly associated with cognitive performance and decline, with mediation by global neuropathological burden. We also observed a significant inverted U-shaped relationship between E/I ratios and neurofibrillary tangle severity, peaking at the limbic stage (Braak III-IV) in 14 brain areas, including the bilateral hippocampus and superior frontal gyrus. In addition, we identified 89 genes and 101 proteins that predict regional E/I ratios, with pathways related to synaptic signaling and immune response overrepresented. The generalizability of these molecular predictors was confirmed in two independent cohorts, achieving good classification performance for neuropathology severity and AD dementia. Lastly, the estimated E/I imbalances in AD aligned with whole-brain distributions of microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, suggesting that spatial cellular organization contributes to vulnerability to neuronal dysfunction. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the cellular, molecular, and neuropathological signatures of circuit-level dysfunction in AD.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681211v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.311328","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Rodriguez, L.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_e0b94ab17b94","title":"CNS","content":"The NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mediator of innate immunity that integrates inflammatory and metabolic stress signals. Increased and/or chronic activation of this critical pathway has been implicated in obesity, with hypothalamic neuroinflammation linked to dysregulation of energy balance. TN-783 is an investigational, CNS-penetrant, small-molecule NLRP3 inhibitor that potently suppressed inflammasome activation across multiple in vitro assays. In diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, only TN-783, and not the peripherally restricted NLRP3 inhibitor TN-101, produced progressive and sustained weight loss, underscoring the requirement for central target engagement. Weight loss was driven by a persistent reduction in food intake across both acute and chronic phases, without altering energy expenditure. This effect was further characterized by selective reduction of fat mass, with minimal impact on lean tissues. Mechanistically, NLRP3 inhibition attenuated DIO-induced hypothalamic neuroinflammation and partially reversed obesity-associated molecular changes based on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the hypothalamus. Beyond monotherapy, TN-783 enhanced the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide by amplifying weight loss, reinitiating weight loss after semaglutide effect had plateaued, and maintaining the weight loss benefit after semaglutide withdrawal. Discontinuation of TN-783 resulted in reversal of both weight and feeding effects, indicating that its therapeutic activity requires ongoing target engagement rather than permanent remodeling of metabolic pathways. Collectively, these observations support central NLRP3 inhibition as a distinct and promising approach for obesity treatment, offering robust induction and sustained maintenance of weight loss while preserving reversibility.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.06.680810v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.311629","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Guo, J., Bachor, T.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_aadaa636629b","title":"Bioinformatic analysis of placental exomiRs targeting the brain in preeclampsia","content":"Background: Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy associated with systemic endothelial dysfunction and, in severe cases, maternal neurological complications. Placenta-derived exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) mediate inter-organ communication and may contribute to neurovascular injury, but their role in maternal brain dysregulation remains unclear. Methods: We performed systems-level bioinformatic analyses of 12 differentially expressed exomiRs (6 from early-onset and 6 from late-onset preeclampsia) to assess their potential impact on brain homeostasis. Target interactomes were examined for functional enrichment, subcellular localization, and network complexity. ExomiR targets were integrated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles from preeclamptic women with neurological symptoms. We further evaluated regulation of blood?brain barrier (BBB) components and mapped spatial expression of target proteins across brain regions and cell types relevant to neurovascular function. Results: Early- and late-onset preeclampsia exomiRs displayed distinct interactomes and biological signatures. Early-onset exomiRs were linked to RNA metabolism, oxidative stress, and endothelial stability, whereas late-onset exomiRs were enriched in nitrogen metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport. Integration with CSF proteomics revealed convergence on dysregulated proteins, including MAPK8, RTN4, and YWHA family members, involved in inflammation, neurodegeneration, and axonal inhibition. Several exomiRs targeted BBB-related proteins (CLDN2, TJP1, EFNA5), suggesting coordinated barrier disruption. Spatial mapping localized these targets to endothelial cells, astrocytes, interneurons, and pyramidal neurons, implicating altered synaptic and glial regulation. Conclusions: Preeclampsia-associated exomiRs may impair maternal brain homeostasis through coordinated regulation of neurovascular, inflammatory, and synaptic pathways. These findings identify candidate molecular mediators of preeclampsia-related neurovascular dysfunction and potential biomarkers for maternal brain injury.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.06.680827v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:19.311948","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Alarcon, M., Aguayo, C., Vatish, M., Escudero, C.","raw_content_length":2102,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BBB","CSF"],"persons":["Background","ExomiR"],"locations":["Preeclampsia","preeclampsia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2102,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bioinformatic analysis","placental exomiRs","the brain","preeclampsia","exomiRs","Preeclampsia","a hypertensive disorder","pregnancy","systemic endothelial dysfunction","severe cases"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the brain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bioinformatic analysis":2.0,"placental exomiRs":2.0,"the brain":2.0,"preeclampsia":2.0,"exomiRs":2.0,"Preeclampsia":1.0,"a hypertensive disorder":1.0,"pregnancy":1.0,"systemic endothelial dysfunction":1.0,"severe cases":1.0}},"age_hours":18.745971338611113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0620000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7876,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5449,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0264,"sadness":0.166,"fear":0.1347,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.1028},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.4,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Bioinformatic analysis of exomiRs","Impact of preeclampsia on brain homeostasis","Regulation of blood-brain barrier components"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Could be used as a case study in advanced biology or medical engineering courses.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This research identifies exomiRs associated with preeclampsia and their potential impact on maternal brain homeostasis.

{"id":"ai_engadget_72dfed078f13","title":"Hyper Light Breaker studio will end the game's development and lay off staff","content":"Heart Machine will wind down development on the third-person roguelike Hyper Light Breaker, seemingly confirming that it will never make it out of early access. The follow-up to indie darling Hyper Light Drifter was first announced in 2022 and after several delays finally entered early access at the beginning of 2025. But it looks like a 1.0 release won’t be arriving, with the studio confirming that it is ending development on the game and has had to lay off an unspecified number of its staff as a result. In a statement, Heart Machine said: \"As we wrap up our work on Hyper Light Breaker, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to part with a number of talented team members. This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances. While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.\" The studio said it plans to continue making games with its consolidated workforce — the Devolver-published sci-fi side-scrolling action game Possessor(s) is still due to launch next month — and indicated that Hyper Light Breaker won’t meet an entirely abrupt end. The studio said it plans to \"deliver something meaningful and as polished and complete as we can given our current circumstances\" in January, but added that no further updates are planned for the remainder of 2025. Engadget’s Jessica Conditt tried out a build of Hyper Light Breaker in March of last year, and called it the \"perfect amalgamation of Hyper Light Drifter and Solar Ash\" (the studio’s other game), while praising its hoverboarding gameplay.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyper-light-breaker-studio-will-end-the-games-development-and-lay-off-staff-162941243.html?src=rss","source":"ai_engadget","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hyper-light-breaker-studio-will-end-the-games-development-and-lay-off-staff-162941243.html?src=rss","published_date":"2025-10-09T16:29:52","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:48.607742","language":"en","tags":["languageen-us","author_namematt_tate","consumer","headline","regionus","gadgets","video_games","siteengadget","technology"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics","source_category":"ai","word_count":292,"author":"Matt Tate","raw_content_length":2798,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.46,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hyper Light Breaker","Heart Machine"],"persons":["Hyper Light Breaker"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1905,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hyper Light Breaker studio","the games development","staff","development","early access","Heart Machine","the third-person roguelike Hyper Light Breaker","The follow-up","darling Hyper Light Drifter","several delays"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["the games development","development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hyper Light Breaker studio":2.0,"the games development":2.0,"staff":2.0,"development":2.0,"early access":2.0,"Heart Machine":1.0,"the third-person roguelike Hyper Light Breaker":1.0,"The follow-up":1.0,"darling Hyper Light Drifter":1.0,"several delays":1.0}},"age_hours":2.2500994119444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.0235,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8047,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2122,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0233,"sadness":0.7184,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0182,"disgust":0.0149},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":1,"industry_collaboration_potential":3,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":2,"regional_impact_potential":1},"seece_relevance_score":1.7,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":false,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"none"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Heart Machine","country":"USA","role":"Game development studio"},{"name":"Devolver Digital","country":"USA","role":"Game publisher"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"Heart Machine, a game development studio, is ceasing development of their game Hyper Light Breaker due to funding and market conditions.

{"id":"ai_engadget_c3a28412ad0b","title":"NHTSA launches probe into Tesla’s ‘full self driving’ tech","content":"The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a probe into 2.88 million Tesla electric vehicles currently equipped with the company's \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD) system. As first reported by Reuters, the NHTSA has received more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations as well as numerous crashes. The agency, which oversees the nation’s motor vehicle safety standards, said that Tesla's FSD software has \"induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws,\" with vehicles reportedly running red lights and driving against the flow of traffic. Among the reports the agency has received, six of them allege that a Tesla vehicle with FSD engaged \"approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash with other motor vehicles in the intersection.\" The probe will begin as a preliminary evaluation, after which the NHTSA could issue a recall if it believes the vehicles pose a great enough risk to public safety. The agency has conducted numerous investigations into the EV maker this year alone. At the start of the year, it opened an investigation into Tesla's Smart Summon and Actual Smart Summon features, which allow owners to remotely retrieve their vehicles from a parking spot. Just a few weeks ago, it announced an investigation into the 2021 Model Y over its door handles and whether they risk trapping passengers inside the vehicle. This is also not the first time the agency has looked into the safety of Tesla's driver assist features. Tesla releases its own vehicle safety reports highlighting that accidents per million miles driven are far less common when its FSD technology is engaged than when it is not. However, the company has also fought to have more specific crash data involving FSD kept from public release, citing confidentiality.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html?src=rss","source":"ai_engadget","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html?src=rss","published_date":"2025-10-09T14:11:14","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:39:48.627910","language":"en","tags":["languageen-us","consumer","headline","regionus","transportation","autos","gadgets","siteengadget","technology"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics","source_category":"ai","word_count":310,"author":"Andre Revilla","raw_content_length":3293,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.55,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Reuters","FSD","Tesla","The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration","NHTSA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2067,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["NHTSA","probe","Tesla"," tech","a probe","288 million Tesla electric vehicles","the companys Full Self-Driving","FSD system","Reuters","the NHTSA"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":[" tech"],"healthcare_tech":[" tech"],"renewable_energy":[" tech"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"NHTSA":3.0,"probe":2.0,"Tesla":2.0," tech":2.0,"a probe":1.0,"288 million Tesla electric vehicles":1.0,"the companys Full Self-Driving":1.0,"FSD system":1.0,"Reuters":1.0,"the NHTSA":1.0}},"age_hours":4.560815008055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5233,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.043,"sadness":0.1019,"fear":0.1825,"anger":0.1042,"disgust":0.0414},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":true,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":true,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":5,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":5,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":4.6,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":true,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":true,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"medium"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Tesla","country":"USA","role":"Electric vehicle manufacturer"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[{"name":"NHTSA","country":"USA","funding_type":"Regulatory oversight"}],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":["Analysis of FSD safety data","Impact of autonomous driving on traffic patterns"],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":"Case study on autonomous driving challenges and safety regulations.","hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"The NHTSA is investigating Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system due to safety concerns, including reports of traffic violations and crashes.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_4693c8c45889","title":"Stock market lulls as Tesla slides and Delta soars","content":"Wall Street is taking a pause on Thursday as U.S. stocks and even the price of gold pull back from record highs following their torrid runs. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, coming off its latest all-time high and its eighth gain in the last nine days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 145 points, or 0.3%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower. Gold also fell following its stellar rally this year, while Treasury yields held relatively steady in the bond market. They’re taking a moment following big runs driven in large part by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support the economy. Financial markets have been so relentless, including a roughly 35% leap for the S&P 500 since a low in April, that worries are rising that stock prices may have shot too high and become too expensive. Concerns are particularly strong about the frenzy lifting stocks related to artificial-intelligence technology. Dell Technologies sank 5% for one of the market’s bigger losses, but that only trimmed its surge since talking up its AI growth opportunities earlier in the week. It’s still up 11% for the week so far. Tesla was one of the heaviest weights on the market after falling 2%. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a preliminary evaluation of its “Full Self-Driving” system due to safety concerns. Those losses helped offset a 4.9% ascent for Delta Air Lines, which reported a stronger profit for the summer than analysts expected. Delta also gave a forecast for profit over the full year that topped analysts’ estimates. Its president, Glen Hauenstein, highlighted a broad-based acceleration in sales trends over the last six weeks, including for business travel domestically. Such reports from companies are taking on more significance, offering windows into the strength of the economy. That’s because the U.S. government’s shutdown is delaying reports that would clearly show how the overall economy is doing. This is the second week where the U.S. government has not published its update on unemployment claims, for example, a report that usually guides Wall Street’s trading each Thursday. PepsiCo rose 2.1% after it delivered a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, saying momentum improved for its drinks business in North America. Delivering bigger profits is one of two ways that companies can make their stock prices look less expensive following their big rallies. The other is if their stock prices fall. Akero Therapeutics leaped 16.7% after Novo Nordisk, the Danish maker of weight-loss drug Wegovy, said it would buy the South San Francisco-based drug developer. The price tag could reach $5.2 billion if Akero’s lead product candidate wins federal regulatory approval. MP Materials, a company that mines and processes rare earths in California, rose 7.1% after China announced curbs on its exports of the materials, which are critical for the making of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines. Costco Wholesale climbed 2.4% after the retailer said its revenue rose 8% in September from a year earlier. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after Italy’s Ferrari tumbled 14.1% following the release of financial forecasts that some analysts said were below their expectations. Stocks in Shanghai leaped 1.3% after trading resumed there following a holiday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8% for another one of the world’s bigger moves. Technology giant SoftBank Group surged 11.4% after it announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.13%, where it was late Wednesday. —Stan Choe, AP business writer AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91419607/market-lulls-tesla-delta","published_date":"2025-10-09T17:30:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T18:40:58.915097","language":"en","tags":["news","technology","innovation","business"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":613,"author":"Associated Press","raw_content_length":5578,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tesla","the Federal Reserve","Nasdaq","Treasury","Delta"],"persons":[],"locations":["U.S."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3800,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Stock market lulls","Wall Street","a pause","Thursday","US stocks","even the price","gold","record highs","their torrid runs","The SP"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Stock market lulls":2.0,"Wall Street":1.0,"a pause":1.0,"Thursday":1.0,"US stocks":1.0,"even the price":1.0,"gold":1.0,"record highs":1.0,"their torrid runs":1.0,"The SP":1.0}},"age_hours":1.250427402777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0543,"joy":0.0025,"surprise":0.0122,"sadness":0.0672,"fear":0.8449,"anger":0.0059,"disgust":0.013},"emotion_method":"local"},"seece-energy-tech_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"seece_dimensions":{"dutch_eu_policy_relevance":3,"industry_collaboration_potential":5,"educational_value":3,"applied_research_fit":3,"regional_impact_potential":3},"seece_relevance_score":3.85,"priority_topics":{"hydrogen_energy":false,"grid_integration":false,"mobility_electrification":true,"building_efficiency":false,"industrial_decarbonization":false,"renewable_integration":false},"cross_cutting_topics":{"power_electronics":false,"sector_coupling":false,"energy_data":false,"circular_economy":false},"geographic_context":{"dutch_context":false,"eu_context":false,"regional_locations":[],"transferability_to_nl":"low"},"partnership_intelligence":{"companies":[{"name":"Tesla","country":"USA","role":"Electric vehicle manufacturer"},{"name":"Delta Air Lines","country":"USA","role":"Airline company"},{"name":"Dell Technologies","country":"USA","role":"Technology company"},{"name":"PepsiCo","country":"USA","role":"Food and beverage company"},{"name":"Akero Therapeutics","country":"USA","role":"Drug developer"},{"name":"Novo Nordisk","country":"Denmark","role":"Pharmaceutical company"},{"name":"MP Materials","country":"USA","role":"Rare earth mining and processing"},{"name":"Costco Wholesale","country":"USA","role":"Retailer"},{"name":"Ferrari","country":"Italy","role":"Automobile manufacturer"},{"name":"SoftBank Group","country":"Japan","role":"Technology investment company"},{"name":"ABB","country":"Switzerland","role":"Engineering firm"}],"research_institutions":[],"government_programs":[],"deployment_sites":[]},"educational_opportunities":{"thesis_topics":[],"internship_potential":false,"curriculum_integration":null,"hands_on_opportunities":null},"seece_intelligence_summary":"This article is a market overview, noting Tesla's stock decline due to safety concerns around its \"Full Self-Driving\" system.
