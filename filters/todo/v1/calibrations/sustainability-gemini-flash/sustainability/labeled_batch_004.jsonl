To optimize the locomotion on these challenging terrains, a simulation-aided design approach was used to develop a soft, shape-adapting, wheeled locomotion system. A co-simulation framework combining the discrete element method (DEM) and multibody dynamics (MBD) is employed to simulate the locomotion of a wheeled robot on varying sandy soils, covering both dry and wet sandy soil conditions. A shape-adapting wheel design is proposed, incorporating soft, inflatable elements that enable the wheel to transform between lugged and circular configurations. A discretized flexbody approach is adopted to model the interactions between the sandy soil and the soft, flexible bodies of the shape-adapting wheel design. Simulation results demonstrate improved performance of the shape-adapting wheels across a variety of sandy terrains, including slopes and obstacles. Integrating softness into the wheel improves obstacle climbing performance, while a lugged wheel configuration performs particularly well on loose, dry sandy slopes. This DEM-MBD co-simulation further enables efficient evaluation of locomotion strategies without the need for extensive physical prototyping.","source":"science_frontiers_robotics_ai","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1686519","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:50.332154","language":"en","tags":["open-access","robotics","original_research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"J.

Thus, including robots not only improved production activities but also strengthened the safety measures that once the human operator was handling. Minimizing the impact of the human factor in the process means minimizing incidents related to it. The disassembly of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) poses complex technical, economic, and safety challenges that traditional manual methods struggle to meet. Thus, there is a need for a decision-making tool harmonized with human cooperation, in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role by providing financially viable solutions while ensuring a secure collaborative environment for both humans and robots. This review synthesizes recent advances in AI-enabled robotic disassembly by focusing on four main research areas: i optimization and strategic planning, ii human–robot collaboration (HRC), iii computer vision (CV) integration, and (iv) Safety for Collaborative Applications. A supplementary subsection is also included to briefly acknowledge emerging topics such as reinforcement learning that lie outside the main scope but represent promising future directions.

However, the accuracy of traditional gas identification will decrease if the sample is not balanced or the number of samples is too few. In this paper, a method based on sample expansion is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem. Firstly, the ADASYN-ELM method is proposed to identify the composition of a gas mixture component. The KPCA is used to extract the feature of the sensor signal and the ADASYN method is used to expand the samples. The PSO and GA algorithms were used to optimize the parameters of the ELM classification model to complete the qualitative analysis. Secondly, the S-SMOTE-MLSSVR method was put forward to quantitatively estimate. The S-SMOTE method was used to expand the samples, and the regression model MLSSVR was optimized by PSO and GA algorithms to complete the quantitative analysis. The results show that the accuracy rate after sample expansion is generally higher and the MAPE and RMSE are generally lower than before sample expansion, indicating that the sample expansion method has a positive effect on classification and concentration estimation of mixed gases with extremely unbalanced samples and too few samples.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6254","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.977253","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Yunpeng Gao","raw_content_length":1274,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KPCA","PSO","ELM","MLSSV","Concentration Estimation Method for Unbalanced Gas Sensor"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1274,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Unbalanced Gas Sensor Array Samples","a gas mixture component","Component identification","concentration estimation","gas detection","the accuracy","traditional gas identification","the sample"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Unbalanced Gas Sensor Array Samples":2.0,"a gas mixture component":2.0,"Component identification":1.0,"concentration estimation":1.0,"gas detection":1.0,"the accuracy":1.0,"traditional gas identification":1.0,"the sample":1.0}},"age_hours":12.994632320277779,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.924,"joy":0.0076,"surprise":0.0224,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0098,"anger":0.0167,"disgust":0.011},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a method for improving gas sensor accuracy, which could be used to monitor emissions or detect leaks.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_0988f3461035","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6251: Delay-Compensated Lane","content":"Accurate vehicle state estimation in a lane coordinate system is essential for safe and reliable operation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and autonomous driving. However, achieving robust lane-based state estimation using only low-cost sensors, such as a camera, an IMU, and a steering angle sensor, remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics and the inherent signal delays in vision systems. This paper presents a lane-coordinate-based vehicle state estimator that addresses these challenges by combining a vehicle dynamics-based bicycle model with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a signal delay compensation algorithm. The estimator performs real-time estimation of lateral position, lateral velocity, and heading angle, including the unmeasurable lateral velocity about the lane, by predicting the vehicle’s state evolution during camera processing delays. A computationally efficient camera processing pipeline, incorporating lane segmentation via a pre-trained network and lane-based state extraction, is implemented to support practical applications. Validation using real vehicle driving data on straight and curved roads demonstrates that the proposed estimator provides continuous, high-accuracy, and delay-compensated lane-coordinate-based vehicle states. Compared to conventional camera-only methods and estimators without delay compensation, the proposed approach significantly reduces estimation errors and phase lag, enabling the reliable and real-time acquisition of vehicle-state information critical for ADAS and autonomous driving applications.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6251","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.977618","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Changsun Ahn","raw_content_length":1610,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["vehicle state estimator","Advanced Driver Assistance Systems","Extended Kalman Filter"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1600,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Delay-Compensated Lane","Accurate vehicle state estimation","a lane coordinate system","safe and reliable operation","Advanced Driver Assistance Systems","ADASs","autonomous driving","robust lane-based state estimation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Delay-Compensated Lane":2.0,"Accurate vehicle state estimation":1.0,"a lane coordinate system":1.0,"safe and reliable operation":1.0,"Advanced Driver Assistance Systems":1.0,"ADASs":1.0,"autonomous driving":1.0,"robust lane-based state estimation":1.0}},"age_hours":12.994648289444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.375,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.875,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9543,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0117,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0111,"anger":0.0066,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed vehicle state estimator using real vehicle driving data, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to conventional methods.

Most studies addressed these demands in isolation without integrative approaches. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify key variables explaining players’ physical workload across game quarters and playing positions through principal component analysis (PCA). Ninety-four elite U18 male basketball players were registered during the EuroLeague Basketball ANGT Finals using WIMU PRO™ multi-sensor wearable devices that integrate local positioning systems (LPS) and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). From over 250 recorded variables, 31 were selected and analyzed by PCA for dimensionality reduction, analyzing the effects of game quarter and playing position. Five to eight principal components explained 61–73% of the variance per game quarter, while between four and seven components explained 64–69% per playing position. High-intensity variables showed strong component loadings in early quarters, with explosive distance (loading = 0.898 in total game, 0.645 in Q1) progressively declining to complete absence in Q4. Position-based analysis revealed specific workload profiles: guards required seven components to explain 69.25% of the variance, with complex movement patterns, forwards showed the highest explosive distance loading (0.810) among all positions, and centers demonstrated concentrated power demands, with PC1 explaining 34.12% of the variance, dominated by acceleration distance (loading = 0.887). These findings support situational and individualized training approaches, allowing coaches to design individual training programs, adjust rotation strategies during games, and replicate demanding scenarios in training while minimizing injury risk.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6253","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.978004","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":237,"author":"José Pino-Ortega","raw_content_length":1850,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.185,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["U18","LPS","PCA"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["U Basketball"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1810,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Physical Workload Patterns","Basketball","a high-intensity","intermittent sport","which","physical demands","different contextual variables","Most studies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Physical Workload Patterns":2.0,"Basketball":1.0,"a high-intensity":1.0,"intermittent sport":1.0,"which":1.0,"physical demands":1.0,"different contextual variables":1.0,"Most studies":1.0}},"age_hours":12.99466327111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8616,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.0404,"sadness":0.0189,"fear":0.0157,"anger":0.0326,"disgust":0.0152},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study uses wearable sensor data to analyze physical workload patterns in basketball players.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_e762b555e152","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6250: Anomaly Detection and Objective Security Evaluation Using Autoencoder, Isolation Forest, and Multi","content":"With the rapid development of cybersecurity technologies, cybersecurity testing has played an increasingly critical role in scientific research, new technology validation, system performance evaluation, and talent development. A central challenge in this domain lies in efficiently and rapidly constructing testing environments while ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of test results. To address this issue, this paper proposes an integrated evaluation method specifically designed for cybersecurity testing, combining anomaly detection and predictive analysis techniques. The method first employs an autoencoder (AE) to perform dimensionality reduction on the raw data collected from a testbed environment, followed by anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm. To assess the impact of cyberattacks on the stability of the testbed system, the steady-state data of the environment was treated as the ideal reference. The degree of disruption was then quantified by calculating the Euclidean distance between the dimensionally reduced experimental data and the reference state. Finally, a specific case study was conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, and a percentage-based scoring mechanism was introduced to quantitatively evaluate the security level of the system.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6250","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.978588","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Haibin Zhang","raw_content_length":1337,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Isolation Forest","Anomaly Detection and Objective Security Evaluation Using Autoencoder","Isolation Forest"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["anomaly","Multi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1337,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Anomaly Detection","Objective Security Evaluation","Using Autoencoder","Isolation Forest","Multi","the rapid development","cybersecurity technologies","cybersecurity testing"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["the rapid development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Anomaly Detection":2.0,"Objective Security Evaluation":2.0,"Using Autoencoder":2.0,"Isolation Forest":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"the rapid development":1.0,"cybersecurity technologies":1.0,"cybersecurity testing":1.0}},"age_hours":12.99469251,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7653,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0104,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.1541,"anger":0.0315,"disgust":0.0249},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a method for cybersecurity testing using anomaly detection.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_8610ecba7846","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6249: Design of Partial Mueller","content":"At a particular frequency, most materials and objects of interest exhibit a polarization signature, or Mueller matrix, of limited dimensionality, with many matrix elements either negligibly small or redundant due to symmetry. Robust design of a polarization sensor for a particular material or object of interest, or for an application with a limited set of materials or objects, will adapt to the signature subspace, as well as the available modulators, in order to avoid unnecessary measurements and hardware and their associated budgets, errors, and artifacts. At the same time, measured polarization features should be expressed in the Stokes–Mueller basis to allow use of known phenomenology for data interpretation and processing as well as instrument calibration and troubleshooting. This approach to partial Mueller-matrix polarimeter (pMMP) design begins by defining a vector space of reduced Mueller matrices and an instrument vector representing the polarization modulators and other components of the sensor. The reduced-Mueller vector space is proven to be identical to R15 and to provide a completely linear description constrained to the Mueller cone. The reduced irradiance, the inner product of the reduced instrument and target vectors, is then applied to construct classifiers and tune modulator parameters, for instance to maximize representation of a specific target in a fixed number of measured channels. This design method eliminates the use of pseudo-inverses and reveals the optimal channel compositions to capture a particular signature feature, or a limited set of features, under given hardware constraints. Examples are given for common optical division-of-amplitude (DoA) 2-channel passive and serial/DoT-DoA 4-channel active polarimeters with rotating crystal modulators for classification of targets with diattenuation and depolarization characteristics.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6249","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.978952","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Martha Y.

Existing monitoring systems lack integrated predictive analytics and edge intelligence. To address this, we propose an AI- and IoT-driven monitoring and visualisation framework that integrates edge IoT nodes (Raspberry Pi Prometheus modules) with machine learning models to enable predictive anomaly detection, proactive alerting, and reduced downtime. This system leverages Prometheus, Grafana, and Mimir for data collection, visualisation, and long-term storage, while incorporating Simple Linear Regression (SLR), K-Means clustering, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for anomaly prediction and fault classification. These AI modules are containerised and deployed at the edge or centrally, depending on tenant topology, with predicted risk metrics seamlessly integrated back into Prometheus. A one-month deployment across five MSP clients (500 nodes) demonstrated significant operational benefits, including a 95% reduction in downtime and a 90% reduction in incident resolution time relative to historical baselines. The system ensures secure tenant isolation via VPN tunnels and token-based authentication, while providing GDPR-compliant data handling.

Traditional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems predominantly rely on static images, which limits the characterization of lesion dynamics. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of Transformer-based architectures in enhancing CAD performance within the realm of liver pathology. The methodology involved a systematic comparison of deep learning models for the analysis of CEUS images and videos. For image-based classification, a Hybrid Transformer Neural Network (HTNN) was employed. It combines Vision Transformer (ViT) modules with lightweight convolutional features. For video-based tasks, we evaluated a custom spatio-temporal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a Video Vision Transformer (ViViT). The experimental results show that the HTNN achieved an outstanding accuracy of 97.77% in classifying various types of FLLs, although it required manual selection of the region of interest (ROI). The video-based models produced accuracies of 83%, 88%, and 88%, respectively, without the need for ROI selection. In conclusion, the findings indicate that Transformer-based models exhibit high accuracy in CEUS-based liver diagnosis. This study highlights the potential of attention mechanisms to identify subtle inter-class differences, thereby reducing the reliance on manual intervention.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6247","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.979546","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Mihai-Eronim-Octavian Ursan","raw_content_length":1536,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Transformer","CNN","Vision Transformer","Convolutional Neural Network","CEUS","CAD","HTNN","ViT"],"persons":["Vol","Long Short-Term Memory","Versus Videos"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1536,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Images Versus Videos","Contrast","The background","the article","the diagnosis","focal liver lesions","FLLs","contrast-enhanced ultrasound"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Images Versus Videos":2.0,"Contrast":2.0,"The background":1.0,"the article":1.0,"the diagnosis":1.0,"focal liver lesions":1.0,"FLLs":1.0,"contrast-enhanced ultrasound":1.0}},"age_hours":12.994739011388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8355,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.0121,"fear":0.0218,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0863},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on using Transformer-based models for liver lesion diagnosis.

Conventional YOLOv8s-based target detection algorithms often suffer from missed detections due to their reliance on single-frame features. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an improved detection algorithm that integrates a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network into the YOLOv8s framework. By incorporating time-series modeling, the LSTM module enables the retention of historical features and dynamic prediction of UAV trajectories. The loss function combines bounding box regression loss with binary cross-entropy and is optimized using the Adam algorithm to enhance training convergence. The training data distribution is validated through Monte Carlo random sampling, which improves the model’s generalization to complex scenes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances UAV detection performance. In addition, when deployed on the RK3588-based embedded system, the method achieves a low false negative rate and exhibits robust detection capabilities, indicating strong potential for practical applications in airspace management and counter-UAV operations.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6246","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.979877","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Song Fu","raw_content_length":1391,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UAV"],"persons":["Vol","Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1361,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","This study","the unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV localization technology","the framework","a low-altitude economy","particular emphasis","the accurate and real-time identification","tracking"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the unmanned aerial vehicle":1.0,"UAV localization technology":1.0,"the framework":1.0,"a low-altitude economy":1.0,"particular emphasis":1.0,"the accurate and real-time identification":1.0,"tracking":1.0}},"age_hours":12.994754231944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8131,"joy":0.0076,"surprise":0.0362,"sadness":0.0403,"fear":0.0455,"anger":0.0257,"disgust":0.0316},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents an improved UAV detection algorithm using LSTM within the YOLOv8s framework.

Crucially, ADEL also adopts adaptive weighted predictions of the three base classifiers based on reconstruction errors and hybrid losses for robust classification. The methodology employs (1) three heterogeneous neural networks for robust feature extraction; (2) the hybrid losses refine feature space structure and preserve feature integrity for better feature generalization; and (3) collaborative decision-making via adaptive weighted reconstruction errors of the base learners for precise inference. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of ADEL. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms other competing methods.

In this paper, we propose a one-class deep learning anomaly detection model named “U-AttentionFlow” based on acoustic signals from the OLTC operation. The proposed model is trained exclusively on normal operating data to accurately model normal patterns and identify anomalies when new signals deviate from the learned patterns. To enhance the ability of the model to focus on significant features, we integrate the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network architecture. Furthermore, static positional encoding and multihead self-attention (MHSA) are employed to effectively learn the temporal characteristics of time-series acoustic signals.

Accurate prediction in agriculture practices, particularly crop recommendations, can greatly enhance productivity and resource management. IoT and AI technologies have great potential for enhancing precision farming; traditional machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) models rely primarily on the training data for predictions. When the training data is noisy or limited, these models can result in inaccurate or unrealistic predictions. These limitations are addressed by incorporating physical laws into the ML framework, thereby ensuring that the predictions remain physically plausible. In this study, we conducted a detailed analysis of ML and EL models, both with and without optimization, and compared their performance against a physics-informed ML model. In the proposed stacking physics-informed ML model, the optimal temperature and the pH for each crop (physics law) are provided as input during the training process in addition to the training data. The physics-informed model was trained to simultaneously satisfy two objectives: (1) fitting the data, and (2) adhering to the physics law. This was achieved by including a penalty term within its total loss function, forcing the model to make predictions that are both accurate and physically feasible. Our findings indicate that the proposed novel stacking physics-informed model achieved a highest accuracy of 99.50% when compared to ML and EL models with optimization.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6243","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:51.980828","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Deepa Kanmani Swaminathan","raw_content_length":1571,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Physics Agriculture","IoT"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1561,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Physics","the training data","Agriculture","the backbone","many countries","a pivotal role","a countrys overall economy","Accurate prediction"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the training data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Physics":2.0,"the training data":2.0,"Agriculture":1.0,"the backbone":1.0,"many countries":1.0,"a pivotal role":1.0,"a countrys overall economy":1.0,"Accurate prediction":1.0}},"age_hours":12.994799117777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.634500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7269,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9408,"joy":0.0104,"surprise":0.0109,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0144,"anger":0.0084,"disgust":0.0109},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a physics-informed ML model for crop recommendation, achieving 99.50% accuracy in a study.

In particular, vertical crosstalk (V-CT) in vertical-alignment LCDs arises mainly from fringing electric fields generated by data lines, along with secondary contributions from data line–pixel coupling effect, thin-film transistor leakage, and other factors. To resolve V-CT, we propose a memory-efficient compensation algorithm implemented on a field-programmable gate array as a customized timing controller. The proposed algorithm achieves compensation accuracy within 2% while significantly reducing memory requirements. A conventional 7680 × 4320 pixel LCD panel requires approximately 796 MB of memory for compensation data, whereas our method reduces this to only 0.37 MB—a nearly 2000-fold reduction—by referencing only preceding pixel information. This approach enables cost-effective implementation, faster processing, and enhanced image quality. Overall, the proposed method provides a practical and scalable solution for resolving V-CT in 8K LCD panels, establishing a new benchmark for high-resolution display technologies.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/19/3965","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.520486","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Min Jae Ko","raw_content_length":1267,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["V-CT","LCD"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1227,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A Memory","V-CT","ultra-high resolution liquid crystal displays","LCDs advance","crosstalk","a critical challenge","the reduced spacing","electronic circuits"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Memory":2.0,"V-CT":2.0,"ultra-high resolution liquid crystal displays":1.0,"LCDs advance":1.0,"crosstalk":1.0,"a critical challenge":1.0,"the reduced spacing":1.0,"electronic circuits":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995462662500001,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8023,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0347,"sadness":0.0304,"fear":0.0269,"anger":0.0656,"disgust":0.0345},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a memory-efficient algorithm for LCD panels, reducing memory requirements by nearly 2000-fold.

Despite these efforts, jailbreak attacks remain a significant threat, exploiting vulnerabilities to elicit harmful responses. While white-box attacks, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) method, have demonstrated promise, their efficacy is often limited by non-smooth optimization landscapes and a tendency to converge to local minima. To mitigate these issues, we propose Spatial Momentum GCG (SM-GCG), a novel method that incorporates spatial momentum. This technique aggregates gradient information across multiple transformation spaces—including text, token, one-hot, and embedding spaces—to stabilize the optimization process and enhance the estimation of update directions, thereby more effectively exploiting model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful responses. Experimental results on models including Vicuna-7B, Guanaco-7B, and Llama2-7B-Chat demonstrate that SM-GCG significantly enhances the attack success rate in white-box settings. The method achieves a 10–15% improvement in attack success rate over baseline methods against robust models such as Llama2, while also exhibiting enhanced transferability to black-box models. These findings indicate that spatial momentum effectively mitigates the problem of local optima in discrete prompt optimization, thereby offering a more powerful and generalizable approach for red-team assessments of LLM safety.

First, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism behind switching transients, identifying that sudden changes in current commands and angle-control misalignment are the key factors triggering oscillations in system power and voltage frequency. To overcome this, we design a virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control angle-tracking technique based on the construction of triangular functions, which effectively eliminates the influence of periodic phase-angle jumps on tracking accuracy and achieves precise pre-synchronization of the microgrid phase in GFM mode. Additionally, we employ a current-command seamless switching technique involving real-time latching and synchronization of the inner-loop current references between the two modes, ensuring continuity of control commands at the switching instant. The simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental results show that the proposed strategy does not require retuning of the parameters after switching, greatly suppresses voltage and frequency fluctuations during mode transition, and achieves smooth, rapid, seamless switching between the GFL and GFM modes of the energy storage converter, thereby improving the stability of microgrid operation.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/19/3963","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.521539","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Xiaorong Zhu","raw_content_length":1446,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Disturbance-Free Switching Control Strategy","GFL","VSG"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1446,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Disturbance-Free Switching Control Strategy","Grid","the problem","transient disturbance","the grid-following GFL","grid-forming GFM mode switching","energy storage converters","this paper"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["energy storage converters"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Disturbance-Free Switching Control Strategy":2.0,"Grid":2.0,"the problem":1.0,"transient disturbance":1.0,"the grid-following GFL":1.0,"grid-forming GFM mode switching":1.0,"energy storage converters":1.0,"this paper":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995508478055557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.5305,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7348,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.021,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.1673,"anger":0.038,"disgust":0.0282},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a control strategy for energy storage converters that improves microgrid stability by enabling seamless switching between grid-following and grid-forming modes.

In this type of research, it is necessary to use a hadronic calorimeter called PSD to determine the centrality value of nuclear collisions. The detector consists of two separate parts, the MPSD and the FPSD. The FPSD, which is a new detector added to the NA61 SHINE experiment from 2022, has not yet had a functional system for remotely changing and measuring the detector position. Such a remote system is necessary for faster detector calibration, more precise positioning of the detector in the accelerator beam path, and improved safety. For these reasons, in 2023, a group of specialists from the NCBJ laboratory at Poland, prepared a project and built a remote position change system for the FPSD detector. In this work, we describe the main design assumptions and main features of the finished system. We also describe its control system based on the Siemens 1200 PLC controller and the way we supervise its operation through an external DCS system based on the EPICS software (ver.3.16).

Therefore, this study proposes a lightweight inspection model based on the YOLOv8 framework, aiming to achieve an optimal balance between inspection accuracy, model complexity, and inference speed. First, we design a novel lightweight module called IRB-GhostConv-C2f (IGC) to replace the C2f module in the backbone, thereby significantly minimizing redundant feature computations. Second, a CNN-based cross-scale feature fusion neck network, the CCFF-ISC neck, is proposed to reduce the redundant computation of low-level features and enhance the expression of multi-scale semantic information. Meanwhile, the novel IRB-SCSA-C2f (ISC) module replaces the C2f in the neck to further improve the efficiency of feature fusion. In addition, a novel dynamic head network, DyHeadv3, is integrated into the head structure, aiming to improve the small-scale target detection performance by dynamically adjusting the feature interaction mechanism. Finally, so as to comprehensively assess the proposed algorithm’s performance, an industrial dataset of wafer defects, WSDD, is constructed, which covers “broken edges”, “scratches”, “oil pollution”, and “minor defects”. The experimental results demonstrate that the CISC-YOLO model attains an mAP50 of 93.7%, and the parameter amount is reduced to 1.92 M, outperforming other mainstream leading algorithms in the field.

The modernization of existing experimental test benches plays a crucial role in improving efficiency, optimizing processes, and ensuring operational safety. This requires updates to their design, experimental methods, data collection, and results recording—all of which provide the foundation for developing new research concepts. An increasing number of innovations are now guided by the principle of minimizing environmental impact. In line with this approach, an innovative modernization of a tube furnace research station was carried out, based on the concepts of sustainable development and the zero-waste philosophy. To enable thermogravimetric analyses of coffee waste, a previously incomplete tube furnace was refurbished using recycled components. The primary objective was to expand the research capabilities of the existing workstation. As part of the modernization, three indicators of reuse efficiency were calculated: the quantitative indicator Wre-use, the mass indicator Wre-usemass, and the cost indicator Wre-usevalue. A quantitative index of 78% and a mass index of approximately 76% were achieved, while the economic value of the recovered components accounted for 11% of the total value of the revitalized research station.

Using annual panel data for six countries—Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman—we apply both the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) and Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFEs) estimators to explore short-run dynamics and long-run equilibrium relationships. These methods are preferred because they balance flexibility with efficiency where PMG allows country differences in short-run dynamics, while DFE provides robustness under small-sample conditions, making them more suitable than the Mean Group (MG) estimator or standard Fixed Effects (FE) models for our short panel of six countries. The results show that traditional electricity consumption significantly supports economic growth in the long run, while renewable energy, despite its potential, has yet to show a statistically significant growth-enhancing effect, likely due to its currently small share in the energy mix. Foreign direct investment and trade openness display mixed impacts, with their significance varying across models. Short-run dynamics highlight the importance of energy efficiency and infrastructure readiness in shaping how energy translates into growth. Overall, the findings suggest that while energy remains central to GCC economies, the transition to renewables must be better aligned with broader development and investment strategies.

This study introduces an innovative traffic load-balancing algorithm developed as part of the IN2CCAM Horizon 2020 project, which was specifically tested in the city of Vigo, Spain. The proposed method incorporates short-term traffic forecasting through machine learning models—primarily Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—alongside a dynamic routing algorithm designed to equalize travel times across alternative routes. Historical speed and volume data collected from Bluetooth sensors were analyzed and modeled to predict traffic conditions 15 min ahead. The algorithm was implemented within the PTV Vissim microsimulation environment to assess its effectiveness. Results from 20 distinct traffic scenarios demonstrated significant improvements: an increase in average speed of up to 3%, an 8% reduction in delays, and a 10% decrease in total standstill time during peak weekday hours.

In Korea, with concentrated ownership, family-controlled conglomerates, and evolving governance norms, the ESG–firm performance link offers unique insights. This study examines 620 publicly listed firms in Korea over the 2020–2022 period to assess the effects of ESG performance on firm value (Tobin’s q) and financial performance (operating return on assets). Three governance-related variables that reflect the distinctive features of Korea’s corporate governance—CEO (chief executive officer) tenure, the shareholding ratio of the largest shareholder, and foreign ownership ratio—are included in the analysis as moderating variables. Results show that ESG performance positively affects both firm value and financial performance. Also, CEO tenure and foreign ownership significantly strengthen the ESG–firm value relationship, whereas the shareholding ratio of the largest shareholder enhances the ESG–financial performance link. These findings extend stakeholder, legitimacy, and institutional theories to an East Asian context and offer practical guidance for managers and policymakers aiming to enhance corporate outcomes through ESG strategies in Korea’s distinctive governance environment.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8944","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.705308","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Joongwha Kim","raw_content_length":1404,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Foreign Ownership Environmental","Firm Performance","ESG"],"persons":["Governance"],"locations":["Korea","Tobin"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1314,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Korea","Sustainability","Pages","ESG and Firm Performance","The Moderating Role","CEO Tenure","Ownership Structure","Foreign Ownership","Environmental Social and Governance ESG management","global relevance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Korea":4.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"ESG and Firm Performance":2.0,"The Moderating Role":2.0,"CEO Tenure":2.0,"Ownership Structure":2.0,"Foreign Ownership":2.0,"Environmental Social and Governance ESG management":1.0,"global relevance":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995813336666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.2885,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5423,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9247,"joy":0.0118,"surprise":0.0251,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0072,"anger":0.0121,"disgust":0.0144},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes the impact of ESG performance on firm value and financial performance in Korean firms.

This study, aligned with Sustainable Development Goals 4 (“Quality Education”) and 5 (“Gender Equality”), provides new evidence on the co-creation process between policymakers and practitioners and women without higher education degrees and its impact. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted through nine in-depth interviews with practitioners and policymakers engaged in the development of dialogic spaces in education, health, and equality. Results: Two key characteristics were identified: (1) a focus on the inclusion of women not yet involved, through the co-creation of egalitarian spaces for dialogue and decision-making, and (2) a commitment to implementing actions based on scientific evidence of social impact. These led to reported improvements in empowerment, education, well-being, health, and employability, not only for the women themselves but also for their families, schools, and communities.

Landscape Quality (LQ), shaped by the interaction of natural processes and human activities, remains methodologically challenging due to its interdisciplinarity and the need to integrate multiple dimensions. This challenge is particularly perceived in peri-urban areas, predominantly understudied in landscape research. This article addresses this gap in LQ assessment at peri-urban landscapes, through the case of Houch Al Oumaraa, Zahleh, a peri-urban area of patrimonial significance and agricultural landscape value. To evaluate the four spatial dimensions of LQ (structural, ecological, cultural and visual), we adopted a mixed methodology, where a pre-developed set of landscape indicators (LIs) applied within GIS and spatial technics, were supplemented by expert analysis through visual studies. Two questions framed this research: (i) is remote sensing sufficient to assess peri-urban LQ, and (ii) what are the limits of applying pre-developed LIs to diverse landscape contexts? Results show moderate fragmentation (CONTAG 61.6%), low diversity (MSDI 0.27), high density of cultural monuments (PROTAP 4.19) and average visual disharmony (FCDHI 0.49). Findings reveal that spatial dimensions alone are insufficient for assessing LQ of peri-urban landscapes, where socio-economic dimensions must also be integrated. Structural indicators (PLAND, MPA, ED, CONTAG) and MSDI proved transferable, while ECOLBAR was less applicable, cultural indicators (PROTAP, HLE) were limited to tangible heritage, and visual indicators (FCDHI, SDHI) highly context dependent. Establishing a differentiated yet standardized framework would not only enhance methodological precision but also ensure that LQ assessment remain relevant across diverse contexts, providing policymakers with actionable insights to align planning with sustainability goals.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8946","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.705988","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":267,"author":"Nabil Nemer","raw_content_length":2011,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.335,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Landscape Quality","The Application of Landscape Indicators for Landscape Quality Assessment"],"persons":["Zahleh"],"locations":["Lebanon"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2011,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","The Application","Landscape Indicators","Landscape Quality Assessment","Case","Zahleh","Lebanon","Landscapes","vital systems"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Application":2.0,"Landscape Indicators":2.0,"Landscape Quality Assessment":2.0,"Case":2.0,"Zahleh":2.0,"Lebanon":2.0,"Landscapes":1.0,"vital systems":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995844070555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.953,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7906,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8216,"joy":0.0128,"surprise":0.0228,"sadness":0.0112,"fear":0.0846,"anger":0.0308,"disgust":0.0162},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a methodology for assessing landscape quality using landscape indicators (LIs) in a peri-urban area.

As the construction sector moves toward decarbonization, strategies for reuse, particularly within Modular and Offsite Construction (MOC), are receiving growing attention. This study presents a digitally integrated framework for the recovery, testing, and reuse of structural steel in MOC, grounded in Circular Economy (CE) principles. The framework is based on a systematic review of 162 academic, industry, and case study records and is structured across four stages: (1) material recovery, (2) testing and certification, (3) integration into MOC, and (4) performance evaluation. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Material Passports (MPs) provide digital infrastructure for traceability, documentation, and compliance with established protocols, such as SCI P427 and P440. Reuse outcomes are assessed using the Modular Reuse Ratio (MRR), Carbon Savings (CS), Lifecycle Cost Savings (LCS), and a tailored Material Circularity Indicator (MCI). By aligning certification requirements with digital processes, the framework addresses current gaps in traceability, standardization, and decision support. It provides a scalable and replicable model that advances structural steel reuse, contributes to sector-wide decarbonization, and supports alignment with emerging CE and performance-based certification schemes.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8945","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.706288","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Osama Moselhi","raw_content_length":1519,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Modular Construction Steel","MOC","Circular Economy","Building Information Modeling","Material Passports"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1519,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","A Conceptual Framework","Enabling Structural Steel Reuse","Circular Economy","Modular Construction","reuse","MOC","Steel production","a major contributor"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Conceptual Framework":2.0,"Enabling Structural Steel Reuse":2.0,"Circular Economy":2.0,"Modular Construction":2.0,"reuse":2.0,"MOC":2.0,"Steel production":1.0,"a major contributor":1.0}},"age_hours":12.99586066388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4939,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7253,"joy":0.0122,"surprise":0.009,"sadness":0.0103,"fear":0.0843,"anger":0.0691,"disgust":0.0899},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework for structural steel reuse in modular construction, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions.

The organic waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and increasing landfill burdens, highlighting the need for novel closed-loop technologies that integrate water, energy, and food resources. Within the context of the Water–energy–food Nexus (WEF), wastewater can be recycled for food production and food waste can be converted into clean energy, both contributing to environmental impact reduction and resource sustainability. A novel household-scale, closed-loop WEF system was designed, installed and operated to manage organic waste while retrieving water for irrigation, nutrients for plant growth, and biogas for energy generation. The system included a biodigester for energy production, a sand filter system to regulate nutrient levels in the effluent, and a hydroponic setup for growing food crops using the nutrient-rich effluent. These components are operated with a daily batch feeder coupled with automated sensors to monitor effluent flow from the biodigester, sand filter system, and the feeder to the hydroponic system. This novel system was operated continuously for two months using typical household waste composition. Controlled experimental tests were conducted weekly to measure the nutrient content of the effluent at four locations and to analyze the composition of biogas. Gas chromatography was used to analyze biogas composition, while test strips and In-Situ Aqua Troll Multi-Parameter Water Quality Sonde were employed for water quality measurements during the experimental study. Experimental results showed that the system consistently produced biogas with 76.7% (±5.2%) methane, while effluent analysis confirmed its potential as a nutrient source with average concentrations of phosphate (20 mg/L), nitrate (26 mg/L), and nitrite (5 mg/L). These nutrient values indicate suitability for hydroponic crop growth and reduced reliance on synthetic fertilizers. This novel system represents a significant step toward integrating waste management, energy production, and food cultivation at the source, in this case, the household.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8942","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.706657","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":304,"author":"Thomas M.

Using a descriptive method and a 26-item questionnaire, data were collected from a representative sample of 360 students in Vojvodina, Serbia. The factors analyzed include computer literacy and technology access (Ph1), students’ ability to balance life obligations with study demands (Ph2), and their motivation for distance learning (Ph3). The results show that 89% of students had adequate IT access, 47% were able to reconcile study and personal obligations, and 70% reported strong motivation. Correlation analysis confirmed a statistically significant positive relationship between all three factors and students’ perceptions of well-organized distance learning, thus supporting the main research hypothesis. Beyond these findings, this study interprets digital literacy as adaptability, time management as resilience, and motivation as value orientation and future thinking—core dimensions of sustainability competences outlined in the European GreenComp framework. Distance learning is therefore positioned not only as an emergency response but also as a transformative pedagogy that integrates brain (knowledge), hands (skills), heart (values), and spirit (purpose), contributing to sustainable and resilient higher education.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8941","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.706997","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Eleonora Brtka","raw_content_length":1464,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COVID-19"],"persons":[],"locations":["Serbia","Vojvodina"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1434,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pages","the Quality","Distance Learning","A Serbian Case","This study","the key factors","the quality","distance learning","higher education","the COVID-19 pandemic"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pages":2.0,"the Quality":2.0,"Distance Learning":2.0,"A Serbian Case":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the key factors":1.0,"the quality":1.0,"distance learning":1.0,"higher education":1.0,"the COVID-19 pandemic":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995892638055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8768,"joy":0.0271,"surprise":0.034,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.0117,"anger":0.0156,"disgust":0.0265},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies factors influencing the quality of distance learning and interprets them as sustainability competences.

Building a strategy for sustainability in family businesses is a crucial factor for their long-term stability, development and ability to respond to dynamic challenges of the business environment. The scientific objective of this research was to identify the status of implementation and the perceived importance of the strategy and development of Slovak family businesses from the perspective of sustainability. To achieve the set objective, the methodological tool employed was a questionnaire survey of a sample of 457 Slovak family businesses. The established hypotheses were tested using the Chi-square test and the Hypothesis Test on Relative Frequency. From the results, it can be concluded that the majority of family businesses consider the implementation of a development and sustainability strategy to be crucial for their further progress and competitiveness, but most businesses have not yet implemented this process. It was found that the majority of family businesses are interested in a comprehensive framework strategy and sustainability, while its implementation directly depends on the size of the business.

Evidence from Chinese Polluting Companies","content":"This study takes the environmental protection tax (EPT) implemented in China in 2018 as the policy background and systematically examines the impact mechanism and boundary conditions of EPT on the market value of listed companies in the polluting industries. The results indicate that EPT significantly inhibits Tobin’s Q of polluting companies. A one-unit increase in EPT leads to a 0.274-unit decrease in Tobin’s Q. The heterogeneity test reveals that the EPT shock exhibits a spatial gradient effect of “Eastern > Central > Western > Northeastern”. The rigidity of the tax system is stronger than that of the pollution discharge fee, and the effect on non-heavily polluting industries is stronger than that on heavily polluting industries. Mechanism analysis shows that while corporate financial flexibility can buffer against short-term EPT shocks, R&D investment and patent quality expose an “innovation trap” characterized by high investment but low conversion efficiency, largely determined by the type of innovation pursued. By elucidating the multiple moderating and mediating mechanisms at play, this study constructs an integrated “institutional pressure-resource constraints-market feedback” model, thereby providing a new analytical framework for environmental economics in emerging markets.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8938","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.707619","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Igor A.

Business model innovation plays a critical enabling role, by aligning farming systems with agroecology. However, designing or transforming farming business models presents significant challenges, as it involves a radical rethinking of the foundational architecture of value creation, delivery, and capture. This study offers a structured and actionable approach to support this process, by developing a conceptual framework that systematically integrates the FAO’s 10 Elements of Agroecology into the Business Model Canvas, drawing on an exploratory literature review and following a five-stage process. The outcome is a prototype of an Agroecological Business Model Canvas (ABMC) that serves as both an analytical and strategic tool to support the design, evaluation, and improvement of agroecological business models. The proposed ABMC redefines conventional components and introduces additional ones to fully reflect agroecological principles and incorporate evaluation elements for assessing both the transition degree and multidimensional sustainability performance. By facilitating iterative reflection and co-design, the ABMC represents a practical device for advancing Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems and supporting farmers in developing context-specific sustainable, resilient, and socially grounded agroecological business models.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8937","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.707945","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Bernardo Corrado de Gennaro","raw_content_length":1531,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Business Model Canvas","an Agroecological Business Model Canvas","FAO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1521,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","A Conceptual Framework","an Agroecological Business Model Canvas","Agroecological transition","stronger sustainability demands","systemic changes","various domains","farms","agroecosystem landscapes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"business_innovation":["an Agroecological Business Model Canvas"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Conceptual Framework":2.0,"an Agroecological Business Model Canvas":2.0,"Agroecological transition":1.0,"stronger sustainability demands":1.0,"systemic changes":1.0,"various domains":1.0,"farms":1.0,"agroecosystem landscapes":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995938917222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8637,"joy":0.0167,"surprise":0.0196,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0595,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.0136},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a conceptual framework (ABMC) for designing agroecological business models.

India exhibited the most consistent and positive ESG-performance relationships for the three financial indicators examined. Among the countries where the ESG score created a difference, in ROA analysis, Türkiye had the greatest difference. ESG scores had a negative contribution to the ROE performance of the companies in Türkiye, China, and Mexico. In the ROS analysis, the first level of differentiation of the decision tree was the inventory turnover ratio.

This study applied the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework—specifically indicators 302 (Energy) and 305 (Emissions)—to evaluate the credibility, scope, and strategic depth of disclosures by 20 Wisconsin (WI) firms in the energy, manufacturing, food, and service sectors. Guided by accountability and legitimacy theory, a comparative content analysis was conducted, complemented by Spearman correlation to examine associations between firm size and disclosure quality. Results show that while firms consistently report basic metrics such as total energy consumption and Scope 1 emissions, disclosures on Scope 3 emissions, renewable sourcing, and energy-efficiency achievements remain partial and selectively framed. Third-party assurance is inconsistently applied, and methodological transparency—such as external audit and coding protocols—is limited, weakening credibility. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between annual revenue and disclosure quality, indicating that greater financial capacity does not necessarily translate into greater transparency. These findings highlight methodological and governance shortcomings, including reliance on generic ESG frameworks rather than climate-focused standards such as Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Integrated reporting approaches are recommended to improve comparability, credibility, and alignment with Wisconsin’s Clean Energy Transition Plan.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8935","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:53:53.708602","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Hadi Veisi","raw_content_length":1720,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GRI","Advancing Energy Transition and Climate Accountability","the Global Reporting Initiative"],"persons":["Governance"],"locations":["Wisconsin","Spearman"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1670,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Energy Transition","Climate Accountability","Wisconsin","A Content Analysis","Corporate Sustainability Reporting","Environmental","Social","Governance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Energy Transition":2.0,"Climate Accountability":2.0,"Wisconsin":2.0,"A Content Analysis":2.0,"Corporate Sustainability Reporting":2.0,"Environmental":1.0,"Social":1.0,"Governance":1.0}},"age_hours":12.995970368888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9085,"joy":0.0082,"surprise":0.0239,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0116,"anger":0.0183,"disgust":0.0227},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes corporate sustainability reports, focusing on energy consumption and emissions disclosures.

By constructing an atlas of these well-positioned nucleosomes, which we called WPNA, we found that their occupancy was associated with histone-DNA affinity, as evidenced by codon usage bias and differences in cirDNA fragment sizes. Moreover, WPNA nucleosome occupancy was different in healthy and cancer samples, thus allowing developing a high-performance machine learning approach for cancer detection (specificity and sensitivity >0.95 for seven cancer types). Cancer influenced WPNA nucleosome occupancy in a global manner, although distinct cancer types retained specific features.

Infection typically leads to immune amnesia and, in rare cases, fatal neurological disease. While current live-attenuated vaccines are highly effective, they primarily elicit neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein, with a less robust response to the fusion (F) protein, a key protein for viral entry. To improve the immunogenicity of the F protein, we designed and characterized stabilized, prefusion MeV F protein antigens. We engineered both soluble ectodomains (FECTO) and full-length, membrane-embedded proteins (FFL) with mutations that confer thermal stability. Cryo-electron microscopy confirmed that these engineered antigens faithfully maintain the native prefusion conformation. When evaluated in a cotton rat model, immunization with either FECTO or FFL constructs induced neutralizing antibodies and elicited protection against viral challenge. The most stable full-length construct (FFL 3M) elicited a more potent neutralizing antibody response than its ectodomain counterpart. Importantly, no evidence of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease was observed. These findings establish that a thermostable, full-length F protein is a superior immunogen to its soluble ectodomain. This work presents a promising candidate for next-generation, non-replicating measles vaccines intended to complement current vaccination strategies and provide a safe option for immunocompromised individuals and others who cannot receive live-virus vaccines.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.07.681039v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:54:47.023693","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","life-sciences","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Zyla, D.

{"id":"ai_engadget_9a8cbb647811","title":"Ferrari's first EV is coming next year with big speed, big sound and a Jony Ive design","content":"Sound is a complicated topic in cars. Some cars are good because they're very loud. Some cars are good because they're very quiet. A select few cars can be counted in both categories. Really, only Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N has managed to check both boxes, but if Ferrari's promises about its first EV are to be believed, we may soon have another entrant. At an event at the company's headquarters in Maranello, Italy, Ferrari unveiled the first proper details about its first EV, the Elettrica, which is set to fully debut next year. We're missing a few key details (such as what it looks like), but after spending a day talking to the various engineers behind this machine, I can finally reveal what makes this car move and how it might sound, too. Power is a key metric for any Ferrari, and the Elettrica has plenty of that. Four electric motors, one per wheel, combine to generate a figure somewhere over 1,000 horsepower. That would put it close to the power of the company's new F80 supercar, but in an era of 2,000-hp EVs, the Elettrica's output isn't exactly stunning. This is something even Ferrari's chief product development officer, Gianmaria Fulgenzi, admitted: \"It's very easy and simple to create power in an electric engine. It's not difficult.\" Cornering, he said, is what it's really all about. He called current performance EVs \"elephants,\" capable of going quickly in a straight line but failing miserably at being compelling machines to drive. That's partly why the Elettrica has four motors. That way, the car's traction and stability management systems can modulate power to maximize grip at each tire individually, rather than relying on one or two motors with differentials to try to manage wheelspin.But it goes deeper than that. The Elettrica can also steer each rear wheel independently, more or less on the inside or outside of the turn to help manage (or perhaps even induce) oversteer. The front motors and inverter on the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari Finally, the Elettrica will have active suspension, a novel type that debuted on the Purosangue SUV and is also used on the F80 supercar. Ferrari's dampers replace traditional valves and oil with an electric motor that provides the resistance. This means, again, the damping and ride height of the car can be adjusted independently at each corner, nearly instantly. All that, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said, will result in an EV that drives like none other on the road: \"We want to show that we are able to harness any technology in a unique way.\" Making a compelling EV, a type of car that many decry as too samey, would be a bold way to do it. One key factor to this is a unique sound. Ferrari engineers knew that they needed to come up with some sort of acoustic accompaniment for the Elettrica, but they also knew it had to be authentic. \"We didn't create a fake sound, like a starship or something like that,\" Fulgenzi said. \"We wanted to have exactly the sound of the electric engine.\" Ferrari came up with a solution similar to the one Porsche used for the Taycan, but it executed it in a novel way. In the Taycan, Porsche sampled and remixed the sounds of the car's electrical components. For the Elettrica, Ferrari actually installs an accelerometer inside the casing of the rear electric motors. That sensor picks up the harmonic resonance and runs it through a digital amplifier to create a sound that isn't a sample — it’s actually coming directly from those motors. Fulgenzi likens it to an amp on an electric guitar, picking up the near-inaudible vibration of the strings and turning it into (potentially ear-splitting) sound. That's perhaps a bit aspirational, but the proof of course will be in the listening, something that Ferrari sadly hasn't let me (or anyone else) do just yet. The rear motor and inverter for the Ferrari Elettrica. Ferrari They're also not showing anyone what the thing looks like, but it seems safe to expect that this machine will bear a shape and design unlike any Ferrari that's come before. That’s because Ferrari is, for the first time, working with design house LoveFrom, better known as the house that Jony Ive built after leaving Apple in 2019 and then sold to OpenAI for $6.5 billion. LoveFrom has worked on a fair few projects since its inception, but this will be the company's first car. Given that, we have absolutely nothing to go on when it comes to visual style. But if I had to guess, I'd say something with a minimalist vibe is on the menu based on Ive's previous work. (And also his own car collection, which features a lot of classic bits of iconic British motoring.) What we do know is that the Elettrica will have four doors and four seats. No, then, this won't be a proper sports car, instead sitting somewhere between grand tourer and SUV. It'll be something designed with a bit of practicality and comfort, able to waft calmly and quietly if you like. Or, with the twist of a few knobs on the steering wheel, it's able to tighten up and get loud when you're feeling more rowdy. With somewhere north of 330 miles of range, it should make for a decent tourer, too. That comes from a 122 kWh (gross) battery pack that's split up into 15 modules, each containing 14 NMC pouch cells. The cells are initially sourced from SK On, but Ferrari made it clear they're not tied to that supplier. Indeed, the company hopes to evolve the battery pack design and chemistry over the years, keeping some version of it available for decades to come. This is, after all, a Ferrari, a machine that ostensibly will just keep getting more valuable as it ages. That, though, is a challenge currently stymying other makers of premium EVs. Can Ferrari make a truly desirable, truly premium EV? Having Jony Ive's name attached certainly doesn't hurt. We'll all have to wait until early next year to see how it looks and how it sounds. I personally won't get too excited about this car until then, but I am very glad that it even exists. Back in 2011, Luca Di Montezemelo, then-CEO of Ferrari, told me that Ferrari would never make an EV. I was skeptical of his statement back then, and 14 years later, I'm glad to see the company finally coming around.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ferraris-first-ev-is-coming-next-year-with-big-speed-big-sound-and-a-jony-ive-design-083000380.html?src=rss","source":"ai_engadget","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ferraris-first-ev-is-coming-next-year-with-big-speed-big-sound-and-a-jony-ive-design-083000380.html?src=rss","published_date":"2025-10-08T18:41:44","collected_date":"2025-10-09T12:55:18.697307","language":"en","tags":["languageen-us","transportation","consumer","autos","technology","gadgets","formula_one","headline","siteengadget","motor_racing"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics","source_category":"ai","word_count":1088,"author":"Tim Stevens","raw_content_length":7678,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":5.44,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hyundai","Ioniq 5 N","Ferrari"],"persons":["Elettrica"],"locations":["Ferrari","Italy","Maranello"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":6366,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ferraris first EV","big speed","big sound","a Jony","design","Some cars","its first EV","Sound","a complicated topic","cars"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["design"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ferraris first EV":2.0,"big speed":2.0,"big sound":2.0,"a Jony":2.0,"design":2.0,"Some cars":2.0,"its first EV":2.0,"Sound":1.0,"a complicated topic":1.0,"cars":1.0}},"age_hours":18.31088198638889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.784,"joy":0.0553,"surprise":0.1346,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0091,"anger":0.0055,"disgust":0.0076},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article details Ferrari's upcoming EV, the Elettrica, with some concrete specifications like a 122 kWh battery and over 330 miles of range.
