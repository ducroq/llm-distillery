Then, the product in the (algebraic) based loop group $\\Omega(K)$ gives rise to a comultiplication in the topological $T$-equivariant $K$-ring $K_T^{top}(\\Omega(K))$. Recall that $\\Omega(K)$ is identified with the affine Grassmannian $\\mathcal{X}$ (of $G$) and hence we get a comultiplication in $ K_T^{top}(\\mathcal{X})$. Dualizing, one gets the Pontryagin product in the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology $K^T_0(\\mathcal{X})$, which in-turn gets identified with the convolution product (due to S. Kato). Now, $ K_T^{top}(\\mathcal{X})$ has a basis $\\{\\xi^w\\}$ over the representation ring $R(T)$ given by the ideal sheaves corresponding to the finite codimension Schubert varieties $X^w$ in $\\mathcal{X}$. We make a positivity conjecture on the comultiplication structure constants in the above basis. Using some results of Kato, this conjecture gives rise to an equivalent conjecture on the positivity of the multiplicative structure constants in $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory $QK_T(G/B)$ in the Schubert basis.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07689","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.488146","language":"en","tags":["mathag","mathkt","mathgr","mathematics","preprints","mathat","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Shrawan Kumar","raw_content_length":1241,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["\\mathcal{X}$","loop group","Borel","Conjectural Positivity for Pontryagin Product in Equivariant K arXiv:2510.07689v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["K_T^{top}(\\mathcal{X})$.

To address this, we develop a generalized Floquet theory and construct nested invariant cones for the systems. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the Poincar\\'{e}-Bendixson property for the limit set persists under $C^1$-perturbations. By applying the generalized Floquet theory and the nested invariant cones, we establish that the stable and unstable manifolds of any two connecting hyperbolic critical elements intersect transversally, with the exception of two hyperbolic equilibria possessing the same odd Morse index. Next, we prove the generic hyperbolicity of critical elements using the Sard-Smale theorem. Furthermore, by formulating the transversality condition as a functional constraint, we generically preclude connecting orbits between hyperbolic equilibrium points with the same odd Morse index, thereby establishing the generic Kupka-Smale property. Finally, under dissipative assumptions, we show that the system generically exhibits the Morse-Smale property. Our findings characterize the stability of bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems in two distinct manners: $C^1$- small perturbations of the system do not alter the asymptotic behavior of orbits; from a topological perspective, generic vector fields in bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems are structurally stable.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07702","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.488947","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","preprints","mathds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Xu Cheng, Yi Wang, Dun Zhou","raw_content_length":1465,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Morse"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["Floquet"],"monetary":["C^1$-perturbations"]},"char_count":1464,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Structural stability","the bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems","arXiv251007702v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The present paper","the structural stability","bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems","a generalized Floquet theory","nested invariant cones","the systems"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Structural stability":2.0,"the bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems":2.0,"arXiv251007702v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The present paper":1.0,"the structural stability":1.0,"bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems":1.0,"a generalized Floquet theory":1.0,"nested invariant cones":1.0,"the systems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792196138888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.937,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8126,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8352,"joy":0.0822,"surprise":0.0514,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0042,"anger":0.0154,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on the theoretical structural stability of bidirectional cyclic negative feedback systems.

A well-designed formulation for a PSH model is essential when incorporating the PSH units into a day-ahead unit commitment model. In the literature, the formulation of a PSH model is generally based on the individual PSH unit. This formulation is tight if there is only one PSH unit in the reservoir. However, when there are multiple units sharing the same reservoir in a PSH plant, the existing formulation may introduce some symmetric structures which degrade the efficiency of a mixed-integer programming solver significantly. In this paper, to cope with the symmetric structure in the PSH plants that have multiple units, we propose two new formulations. The first formulation considers the case in which there are multiple identical units sharing the same reservoir. The second formulation considers a general case in which the units sharing the same reservoir have the same generating and pumping efficiency. Using the new formulations, the symmetric structures in the problem can be effectively broken. Numerical results are presented to study the computational efficiency of the new formulations.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07751","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.490483","language":"en","tags":["mathoc","mathematics","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Shaoze Li, Junhao Wu, Zhibin Deng","raw_content_length":1233,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PSH"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1232,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Variable aggregation","a PSH model","the flexibility","power systems","A well-designed formulation","the PSH units","a day-ahead unit commitment model","the literature","the formulation","the individual PSH unit"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Variable aggregation":2.0,"a PSH model":2.0,"the flexibility":1.0,"power systems":1.0,"A well-designed formulation":1.0,"the PSH units":1.0,"a day-ahead unit commitment model":1.0,"the literature":1.0,"the formulation":1.0,"the individual PSH unit":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7922500494444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.329,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8658,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9419,"joy":0.0111,"surprise":0.0258,"sadness":0.0041,"fear":0.0033,"anger":0.0083,"disgust":0.0055},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes new formulations for pumped storage hydro (PSH) models to improve computational efficiency when multiple units share a reservoir.

This paper proposes refined price-adjustment processes to overcome these limitations. By formulating the task of finding CE of a (quasi-)linear Fisher market as a strongly convex nonsmooth minimization problem, we develop a novel accelerated price-adjustment method (APM) that finds an $\\epsilon$-CE price in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ lightweight iterations, which significantly improves upon the iteration complexities of t\\^atonnement methods. Furthermore, through our new formulation, we construct a recovery oracle that maps approximate CE prices to exact CE prices at a low computational cost. By coupling this recovery oracle with APM, we obtain an adaptive price-adjustment method whose iterates converge to CE prices in finite steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee to exact CE for price-adjustment methods in linear and quasi-linear Fisher markets. Our developments pave the way for efficient lightweight computation of CE prices. We also present numerical results to demonstrate the fast convergence of the proposed methods and the efficient recovery of CE prices.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07759","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.491249","language":"en","tags":["mathoc","mathematics","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"He Chen, Chonghe Jiang, Anthony Man-Cho So","raw_content_length":1469,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["APM","Accelerated Price Adjustment"],"persons":["\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\epsilon)$"]},"char_count":1468,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Accelerated Price Adjustment","Fisher Markets","Exact Recovery","Competitive Equilibrium","arXiv251007759v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The canonical price-adjustment process","tatonnement","the exact competitive equilibrium","a high iteration complexity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Accelerated Price Adjustment":2.0,"Fisher Markets":2.0,"Exact Recovery":2.0,"Competitive Equilibrium":2.0,"arXiv251007759v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The canonical price-adjustment process":1.0,"tatonnement":1.0,"the exact competitive equilibrium":1.0,"a high iteration complexity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792279381666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.866,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.071,"sadness":0.0159,"fear":0.0106,"anger":0.0209,"disgust":0.0087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel accelerated price-adjustment method (APM) for Fisher markets, claiming to find an $\\epsilon$-CE price in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ iterations, improving upon existing methods.

The main part of this article consists of the proof of the description of the second page of said spectral sequence. This description provides a link between the cohomology of the orbit space (basic cohomology of the foliation by orbits) the Lie algebra cohomology of the appropriate pair $(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{h})$ representing the cohomology of a generic orbit and the de Rham cohomology of the manifold. Due to the somewhat technical nature of the general description we have provided in the penultimate section a thorough study of special cases in which the sequence can be greatly simplified.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_e39103f3bf59","title":"An efficient algorithm for kernel quantile regression","content":"arXiv:2510.07929v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Kernel Quantile Regression (KQR) extends classical quantile regression to nonlinear settings using kernel methods, offering powerful tools for modeling conditional distributions. However, its application to large-scale datasets is severely limited by the computational burden of the large, dense kernel matrix and the need to efficiently solve large, often ill-conditioned linear systems. Existing state-of-the-art solvers usually struggle with scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly efficient two-phase optimization algorithm tailored for large-scale KQR. In the first phase, we employ an inexact alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to compute a high-quality warm-start solution. The second phase refines this solution using an efficient semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). A key innovation of our approach is a specialized preconditioning strategy that leverages low-rank approximations of the kernel matrix to effectively mitigate the ill-conditioning of the linear systems in the Newton steps of the ALM. This can significantly accelerate iterative solvers for linear systems. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art commercial and specialized KQR solvers in terms of speed and scalability.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07929","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.500917","language":"en","tags":["mathoc","mathematics","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Shengxiang Deng, Xudong Li, Yangjing Zhang","raw_content_length":1369,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KQR","linear","ALM"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["Newton"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1368,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["An efficient algorithm","kernel quantile regression","Announce Type","new Abstract","Kernel Quantile Regression","KQR","classical quantile regression","nonlinear settings","kernel methods","powerful tools"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["An efficient algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"An efficient algorithm":2.0,"kernel quantile regression":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Kernel Quantile Regression":1.0,"KQR":1.0,"classical quantile regression":1.0,"nonlinear settings":1.0,"kernel methods":1.0,"powerful tools":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792616027222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8841,"joy":0.0191,"surprise":0.0347,"sadness":0.0175,"fear":0.0132,"anger":0.0171,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for kernel quantile regression, which could improve the efficiency of machine learning models used in various sustainability applications.

Building on the frictionless left-monotone structure (Beiglb\\\"ock and Juillet, Ann. Probab. 2016; Henry-Labord\\`ere and Touzi, Finance Stoch. 2016; Beiglb\\\"ock et al, Ann. Probab. 2017), we penalize trade increments by a convex cost and prove a frictional monotonicity principle. Optimal couplings admit bi-atomic disintegrations on active components, while a trade band emerges as a no-transaction region where the identity coupling is optimal. The band is characterized in dual variables by a subgradient condition at the origin; off the band, transport moves along two monotone graphs whose endpoints solve an equal-slope system balancing continuation values and marginal trading costs. We establish strong duality with attainment for state-dependent frictions, a dynamic programming identity that aggregates the one time-step problem, and stability of optimal couplings and endpoints under perturbations of marginals and friction. In the vanishing-friction limit the transport maps converge to the frictionless left-curtain coupling. For linear-quadratic frictions, motivated by spread and transient impact (Almgren and Chriss, J. Risk 2001; Obizhaeva and Wang, J. Financ. Mark. 2013), we obtain explicit off-band displacements and comparative statics in liquidity parameters. Applications include model-independent pricing/superhedging of lookback, barrier, and Asian options. Overall, the results link robust superhedging duality (Beiglb\\\"ock et al, Finance Stoch. 2013; Dolinsky and Soner, Finance Stoch. 2014) with the fine geometry of frictional MOT, providing a unified basis for analysis, stability, and computation in multi-marginal robust pricing.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08182","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.512837","language":"en","tags":["mathfa","mathoc","mathpr","mathematics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Pratik Rai","raw_content_length":1899,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Touzi"],"persons":["Ann","Henry-Labord\\`ere","Probab","Juillet"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1896,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Frictional martingale optimal transport","robust hedging","new Abstract","martingale optimal transport","MOT","state-dependent trading frictions","a geometric-duality framework","one time-step","the multi-marginal setting","the frictionless left-monotone structure"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Frictional martingale optimal transport":2.0,"robust hedging":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"martingale optimal transport":1.0,"MOT":1.0,"state-dependent trading frictions":1.0,"a geometric-duality framework":1.0,"one time-step":1.0,"the multi-marginal setting":1.0,"the frictionless left-monotone structure":1.0}},"age_hours":2.793036473888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.9225,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7845,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3234,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0065,"sadness":0.0151,"fear":0.0247,"anger":0.5311,"disgust":0.0943},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for optimizing trading strategies with frictions, which could potentially improve the efficiency of financial markets related to green assets and hedging climate risks.

Furthermore, we show that this result is sharp by citing a known infinite family of signed graphs with a balanced Hamiltonian circuit that do not admit a nowhere-zero 5-flow. Our proof relies on a construction that transforms signed graphs whose underlying graph admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow into a signed 3-edge-colorable cubic graph.

We prove that a Lagrangian supplement of $H^0(C, \\Omega_C)$ in the de Rham cohomology group $H^1_{dR}(C)$ determines and is determined by a particular type of symmetric bidifferential on $C^2$ (its polar divisor must be twice the diagonal and have biresidue one along it). When $k$ is the complex field, a natural choice of such supplement is $H^{0,1}(C)$ and we show that this corresponds with the bidifferential that after a twist is the rational $2$-form on $C^2$ found by Biswas-Colombo-Frediani-Pirola.

Starting from the standard Dirac operator, we restrict to a fundamental Weyl chamber of a finite Coxeter group equipped with the Heckman--Opdam measure, and determine the necessary drift and reflection corrections that ensure formal skew--adjointness under this weighted geometry. This procedure naturally reproduces the Dunkl operators as the unique first--order deformations compatible with reflection symmetry, whose Clifford contraction defines the Dirac--Dunkl operator and whose square yields the Dunkl Laplacian. We then extend the construction to include arbitrary unitary representations of the reflection group, obtaining representation-dependent Dirac--Dunkl operators that act on spinor- or matrix-valued functions. In the scalar and sign representations, these operators recover respectively the bosonic and fermionic Calogero--Moser systems, while higher-dimensional representations give rise to multi-component spin--Calogero models. The resulting framework unifies analytic, geometric, and representation-theoretic aspects of Dirac and Dunkl operators under a single symmetry-reduction principle.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08283","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.520208","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Cristina Sard\\'on","raw_content_length":1313,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dirac","Symmetry Reduction arXiv:2510.08283v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["Heckman","Weyl","Clifford","Dunkl"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1312,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dirac","Dunkl Operators","Symmetry Reduction","arXiv251008283v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","a geometric and analytic derivation","Dunkl operators","symmetry reductions","the flat Dirac operator"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dirac":3.0,"Dunkl Operators":2.0,"Symmetry Reduction":2.0,"arXiv251008283v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a geometric and analytic derivation":1.0,"Dunkl operators":1.0,"symmetry reductions":1.0,"the flat Dirac operator":1.0}},"age_hours":2.793292058888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8456,"joy":0.0423,"surprise":0.0854,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0116,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a theoretical paper about mathematical operators.

In this work, we remove the convexity condition and establish new qualitative properties of solutions under general assumptions on the diffusion and mobility functions. In two spatial dimensions, we prove uniqueness of weak solutions, their smoothing effect for positive times, and convergence to equilibrium as time tends to infinity. In three dimensions, we show local well-posedness of strong solutions for arbitrary initial data and global existence for data close to energy minimizers, yielding a Lyapunov stability principle.

In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include: _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole. _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations. In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\\mathcal{S}=\\{r=0\\}$. Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities.

Under natural conditions on the associated transfer operators, we prove the existence of thermodynamic limits of expectations of local observables and establish almost-sure exponential decay of two-point correlations. In the homogeneous (random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability, the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the mixing profile: ($\\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability, while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\\rho$) (resp. ($\\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the two-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability guarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on stationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a transfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07561","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.541903","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Lubashan Pathirana, Albert H.

To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when \"embezzling\" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07563","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.542342","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","mathoa","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Lauritz van Luijk","raw_content_length":1291,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type","the von Neumann","von Neumann","Hilbert"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1290,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Entanglement","von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory","subsystems","arXiv251007563v1 Announce Type","cross","quantum systems","infinitely many degrees","freedom","states","a pair"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Entanglement":2.0,"von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory":2.0,"subsystems":2.0,"arXiv251007563v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"quantum systems":1.0,"infinitely many degrees":1.0,"freedom":1.0,"states":1.0,"a pair":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7939616783333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8239,"joy":0.0077,"surprise":0.1308,"sadness":0.0099,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0135,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research exploring the nature of entanglement in quantum systems.

A central challenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate Haar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford operations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able to generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial quantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford gates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design only to a subsystem of size $\\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This \"seed\" design is then \"diluted\" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between two random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an $\\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this construction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using only $\\tilde{O}(k^2 \\log\\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires security only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford cost decreases to $\\tilde{O}(k + \\log^{1+c} \\varepsilon^{-1})$. This is optimal, since we show that at least $\\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are required in this setting. Compared to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces non-Clifford overhead while strengthening security guarantees to adaptive security as well as removing artificial assumptions between $n$ and $k$.

We show that the sparseVCBART posterior contracts at a near-minimax optimal rate, automatically adapting to the unknown sparsity structure and smoothness of the true coefficient functions. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, sparseVCBART achieved competitive predictive accuracy and substantially narrower and better-calibrated uncertainty intervals, especially for null covariate effects.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_0f52f2683362","title":"Exponential Speed","content":"arXiv:2510.08292v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees. In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states. We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time.

This paper explores further the scale function source term to construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08433","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.555368","language":"en","tags":["gr-qc","math-ph","mathematics","preprints","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":297,"author":"E.

However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08538","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.559109","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","cond-matstat-mech","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":178,"author":"Thiago Bergamaschi, Chi-Fang Chen, Umesh Vazirani","raw_content_length":1317,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Markov Properties","Markov"],"locations":["Gibbs"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1316,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Structural Theory","Quantum Metastability","Markov Properties","Area Laws","metastable states","arXiv251008538v1 Announce Type","cross","Statistical mechanics","a quantum many-body system","low temperature"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Structural Theory":2.0,"Quantum Metastability":2.0,"Markov Properties":2.0,"Area Laws":2.0,"metastable states":2.0,"arXiv251008538v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Statistical mechanics":1.0,"a quantum many-body system":1.0,"low temperature":1.0}},"age_hours":2.79450668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.308499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8617,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.882,"joy":0.0128,"surprise":0.044,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0213,"anger":0.0225,"disgust":0.0112},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding metastable states in quantum systems, which could potentially improve quantum thermal simulation.

Towards constructing such a bijection, we generalize the result by introducing certain natural extensions for both objects along with $n+3$ parameters and show that the multivariate generating functions with respect to these parameters coincide. This is a significant step from a constant number of equidistributed statistics to a linear number of statistics in $n$. The equinumeracy of VSASMs and the lozenge tilings is then an easy consequence of this result, which is obtained by specializing the generating functions to signed enumerations for both types of objects and then applying certain sign-reversing involutions. Another main result concerns the expansion of the multivariate generating function into symplectic characters as a sum over totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions, which is in perfect analogy to the situation for ordinary ASMs where the Schur expansion can be written as a sum over totally symmetric plane partitions. This is exciting as it is reminiscent of the well-known Cauchy identity, and the Cauchy identity does have a bijective proof using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence, and thus the result raises the question of whether there is a variation of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence that does eventually lead to a bijective proof.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04469","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.561878","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathco","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Ilse Fischer, Hans H\\\"ongesberg","raw_content_length":1758,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.295,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VSASMs"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$2n+2$","2n$","2n+1","$n+3$","$2$","n$."]},"char_count":1757,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["sign matrices","reflective symmetry","plane partitions","equivalent statistics","a Cauchy","arXiv220704469v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Vertically symmetric alternating sign matrices","VSASMs","order"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"sign matrices":2.0,"reflective symmetry":2.0,"plane partitions":2.0,"equivalent statistics":2.0,"a Cauchy":2.0,"arXiv220704469v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Vertically symmetric alternating sign matrices":1.0,"VSASMs":1.0,"order":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7945997152777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.703,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1406,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.832,"joy":0.015,"surprise":0.1079,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.0102,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0099},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

We show the robustness of our results to perturbations of the cycle, and extend them to class of functions that also satisfy higher-order regularity conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11291","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.564155","language":"en","tags":["mathoc","mathematics","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Baptiste Goujaud, Adrien Taylor, Aymeric Dieuleveut","raw_content_length":1302,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\HB$","$L$-smooth $","slower than $1 - \\mathcal{O}(\\kappa)$"]},"char_count":1297,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Provable non","arXiv230711291v2","Announce Type","Abstract","this work","an accelerated convergence rate","smooth strongly convex problems","any condition number","any choice","algorithmic parameters"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algorithmic parameters"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Provable non":2.0,"arXiv230711291v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this work":1.0,"an accelerated convergence rate":1.0,"smooth strongly convex problems":1.0,"any condition number":1.0,"any choice":1.0,"algorithmic parameters":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7946811744444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.5195,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0961,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8164,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0324,"sadness":0.0163,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.034,"disgust":0.0855},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on optimization algorithms.

Roughly speaking, the halfspaces of a group splitting are subgraphs of the Cayley graph obtained by pulling back the halfspaces of the Bass--Serre tree. Our first theorem shows that (under mild conditions) any splitting of a one-ended group can be upgraded to a splitting where all the halfspaces are one-ended. Our second theorem demonstrates that a one-ended group usually has a JSJ splitting where all the halfspaces are one-ended.

We show that while for $n=2$ this minimum is attained by a mosaic with regular hexagon cells, this is not true in any dimension $n > 2$, where the minimum is attained by a mosaic whose cells are Minkowski sums of pairwise orthogonal regular triangles, and possibly a segment. In the second part we investigate $3$-dimensional convex mosaics whose cells are translates of a given convex polyhedron, and show that within this family, mosaics with cubes as cells have minimum edge density.

The Born approximation naturally appears as the linear component of a factorization of the Calder\\'on problem; we show that the non-linear part, obtaining the potential from the Born approximation, enjoys several interesting properties. First, this map is local, in the sense that knowledge of the Born approximation in a neighborhood of the boundary is equivalent to knowledge of the potential in the same neighborhood, and, second, it is H\\\"older stable. This proves that the ill-posedness of the Calder\\'on problem arises from the linear step, which consists in computing the Born approximation from the DtN map by solving a Hausdorff moment problem. Moreover, we present an effective algorithm to compute the potential from the Born approximation. Finally, we use the Born approximation to obtain a partial characterization of the set of DtN maps for radial potentials. The proofs of these results do not make use of Complex Geometric Optics solutions or its analogues; they are based on results on inverse spectral theory for Schr\\\"odinger operators on the half-line, in particular on the concept of $A$-amplitude introduced by Barry Simon.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06321","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.567964","language":"en","tags":["mathap","mathematics","preprints","mathsp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Thierry Daud\\'e, Fabricio Maci\\`a, Crist\\'obal J.

This is the first super-linear bound on the distinct angles problem that has received recent attention. This is derived from a more general claim that if $N$ points in the convex position in the real plane determine $KN$ distinct angles, then $K=\\Omega(N^{1/4})$ or $\\Omega(N/K)$ points are co-circular. The proof makes use of the implicit order one can give to points in convex position, recently used by Solymosi. Convex position also allows us to divide our set into two large ordered pieces. We use the squeezing lemma and the level sets of repeated angles to estimate the number of angles formed between these pieces.

We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.569840","language":"en","tags":["mathsg","mathematics","preprints","mathat","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Laurent C\\^ot\\'e, Yusuf Bar{\\i}\\c{s} Kartal","raw_content_length":1146,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Eilenberg-Maclane","Floer"],"persons":["Announce Type","Liouville","Tate","Morava K-theories","Morava K-theory"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1145,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["generalized homology","Floer homology","arXiv240402776v4","Announce Type","Abstract","an invariant","the completed Tate cohomology","a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum","a complex oriented cohomology theory","the filtered spectrum"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"generalized homology":2.0,"Floer homology":2.0,"arXiv240402776v4":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"an invariant":1.0,"the completed Tate cohomology":1.0,"a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum":1.0,"a complex oriented cohomology theory":1.0,"the filtered spectrum":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7948847455555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9165,"joy":0.0151,"surprise":0.0467,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0035,"anger":0.008,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematical research.

This model problem has many important applications in machine learning and scientific computing, for example, the sparse Fisher discriminant analysis. We propose a manifold proximal-gradient-subgradient algorithm (MPGSA) and show that under mild conditions any accumulation point of the solution sequence generated by it is a critical point of the underlying problem. By assuming the Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz property of an auxiliary function, we further establish the convergence of the full sequence generated by MPGSA under some suitable conditions. When the second component of the DC function involved is the maximum of finite continuously differentiable convex functions, we also propose an enhanced MPGSA with guaranteed subsequential convergence to a lifted B-stationary points of the optimization problem.

It corresponds to the dispersionless limit of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. In the language of formal variational calculus, we address the classification problem for deformations of the Riemann hierarchy satisfying different extra requirements (general deformations, deformations as systems of conservation laws, Hamiltonian deformations, and tau-symmetric deformations), under the natural group of coordinate transformations preserving each of those requirements. We present several results linking previous conjectures of Dubrovin-Liu-Yang-Zhang (for the tau-symmetric case) and of Arsie-Lorenzoni-Moro (for systems of conservation laws) to the double ramification hierarchy construction of integrable hierarchies from partial CohFTs and F-CohFTs. We prove that, if the conjectures are true, DR hierarchies of rank one are universal objects in the space of deformations of the Riemann hierarchy. We also prove a weaker version of the DLYZ conjecture and that the ALM conjecture implies (the main part of) the DLYZ conjecture. Finally we characterize those rank one F-CohFTs which give rise to Hamiltonian deformations of the Riemann hierarchy.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02079","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.597365","language":"en","tags":["mathag","math-ph","mathematics","preprints","nlinsi","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Alexandr Buryak, Paolo Rossi","raw_content_length":1332,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Arsie-Lorenzoni-Moro","Riemann","the Korteweg-de Vries","n}$ arXiv:2504.02079v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract"],"persons":["Dubrovin-Liu-Yang-Zhang"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1331,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Riemann hierarchy","Deformations","the geometry","overlinemathcalM_g","deformations","arXiv250402079v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The Riemann hierarchy","the simplest example","rank"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Riemann hierarchy":3.0,"Deformations":2.0,"the geometry":2.0,"overlinemathcalM_g":2.0,"deformations":2.0,"arXiv250402079v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The Riemann hierarchy":1.0,"the simplest example":1.0,"rank":1.0}},"age_hours":2.795532915,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8999,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.0324,"sadness":0.0093,"fear":0.0127,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0166},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper is theoretical mathematics research.

A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is called a Hessian metric on affine manifold $(M, \\nabla)$, if $g$ can be expressed locally as the Hessian quadratic form of some smooth potential $f$. An affine manifold equipped with a Hessian metric is termed a Hessian manifold. We study the topology and geometry of Hessian manifolds. Key topological constraints are derived, including the vanishing of the Euler characteristic for any compact Hessian manifold and the proof that its fundamental group must be infinite and torsion-free. We demonstrate that compact Hessian manifolds with an abelian fundamental group are homeomorphic to the flat torus. The theory of flat line bundles is developed to introduce the canonical and obstruction bundles, which are used to prove that a curved compact orientable Hessian manifold must be a mapping torus. A Hessian manifold $((M, \\nabla),g)$ is said to be of Koszul type, if there exists a $1$-form $\\eta\\in\\Omega^1(M)$ such that $g=\\nabla\\eta$. We place emphasis on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, establishing an equivalence between their existence and that of positive flat line bundles, space-like Lagrangian immersions, and hyperbolic affine structures. A duality with radiant manifolds, analogous to the classical Legendre transformation, is explored. We also construct a non-trivial family of compact Hessian manifolds of Koszul type with negative scalar curvature, and classify all complete Hessian surfaces.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01176","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.611844","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathdg","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Hanwen Liu","raw_content_length":1682,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Topology"],"persons":["\\nabla$","Euler","affine manifold","TM\\rightarrow","Hessian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1677,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["nabla","Topology","Geometry","Hessian Manifolds","arXiv250901176v2","Announce Type","Abstract","a pair M","an affine manifold","a flat and torsion-free connection"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a pair M"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"nabla":3.0,"Topology":2.0,"Geometry":2.0,"Hessian Manifolds":2.0,"arXiv250901176v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a pair M":1.0,"an affine manifold":1.0,"a flat and torsion-free connection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7958641622222227,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8808,"joy":0.0198,"surprise":0.0791,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0038,"anger":0.0067,"disgust":0.0033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical research on Hessian manifolds.
