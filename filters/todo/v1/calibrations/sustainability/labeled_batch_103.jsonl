{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_536f276ac034","title":"AB-UPT: Scaling Neural CFD Surrogates for High","content":"arXiv:2502.09692v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, thereby eliminating the need for costly CFD meshing procedures for inference.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09692","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.129820","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Benedikt Alkin, Maurits Bleeker, Richard Kurle, Tobias Kronlachner, Reinhard Sonnleitner, Matthias Dorfer, Johannes Brandstetter","raw_content_length":1777,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CFD"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1776,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["AB-UPT","Neural CFD Surrogates","Announce Type","Abstract","Recent advances","neural surrogate modeling","the potential","transformative innovations","applications","automotive aerodynamics"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["transformative innovations"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"AB-UPT":2.0,"Neural CFD Surrogates":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"neural surrogate modeling":1.0,"the potential":1.0,"transformative innovations":1.0,"applications":1.0,"automotive aerodynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764769887222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.3585,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0717,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8437,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.066,"sadness":0.0108,"fear":0.0247,"anger":0.0285,"disgust":0.0169},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a novel neural surrogate modeling scheme (AB-UPT) for CFD simulations, demonstrating state-of-the-art predictive accuracy on automotive CFD simulations.

Ze staan daarmee automatisch geregistreerd als donor. Volgens nieuwe cijfers van het CBS geven vooral jongeren tussen de 18 en 25 jaar minder vaak een keuze door: 41 procent deed dit niet. Procentueel zijn ze daarmee de grootste groep in het Donorregister die automatisch is opgenomen. In 2022 maakte 36 procent van de jongeren nog geen actieve keuze. Oudere Nederlanders gaven vaker actief een keuze door. Zo heeft bij de 75-plussers slechts 15 procent van de Nederlanders niet actief een keuze gemaakt. In totaal heeft 24 procent van de Nederlanders geen keuze opgegeven. Iedereen die 18 wordt krijgt een brief en een herinnering met de vraag een keuze door te geven. Het CBS-onderzoek meldt niets over de beweegredenen om geen keuze door te geven. Overigens houdt een arts bij overlijden altijd rekening met informatie van nabestaanden, bijvoorbeeld als men overtuigd is dat de overledene echt geen organen wilde donoren. 30.000 meer donors Begin dit jaar stonden in totaal ruim acht miljoen volwassenen geregistreerd als donor. Daarvan hadden 4,8 miljoen mensen actief toestemming gegeven. 3,3 miljoen mensen staan geregistreerd, omdat ze geen keuze hebben ingevuld. Daarmee stonden er bijna 30.000 meer Nederlanders geregistreerd als donor dan het voorgaande jaar. Om het aantal donororganen te laten stijgen, staat sinds 2021 elke Nederlander in principe geregistreerd als orgaandonor. Wie dat niet wil, moet zelf actie ondernemen om die keuze te registreren. In de gemeentes Groningen en Rozendaal staan met 68 en 67 procent de meeste inwoners geregistreerd als donor. In Neder-Betuwe en Urk is dat met 43 en 47 procent het minst. In Urk wonen relatief ook de meeste mensen die geen keuze hebben doorgegeven, 32 procent.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_7347af863d90","title":"Hamas patrouilleert weer in Gaza met toestemming van VS","content":"Sinds het ingaan van het staakt-het-vuren vorige week zijn strijders van Hamas weer openlijk zichtbaar op straat in de Gazastrook. De groep verdween tijdens de gevechten in de afgelopen twee jaar steeds vaker ondergronds, maar in delen van Gaza-Stad patrouilleren nu weer gewapende en gemaskerde mannen in politie-uniformen. Volgens Hamas moeten zij zorgen voor orde na maanden van chaos, maar hun terugkeer benadrukt vooral hoe onzeker de toekomst van het bestuur in Gaza blijft. Amerikaanse 'goedkeuring' De hernieuwde zichtbaarheid van Hamas werd maandag onverwacht bevestigd door de Amerikaanse president Trump. Tijdens een persmoment aan boord van Air Force One zei hij dat de VS \"weten dat Hamas zich aan het herbewapenen is\" en dat Washington de groep \"tijdelijk toestemming\" had gegeven om interne veiligheid te handhaven. \"Ze proberen de orde te herstellen na maanden van oorlog,\" zei Trump, op weg naar Israël. \"Ze hebben waarschijnlijk zestigduizend mensen verloren. Dat is veel vergelding.\" Hij noemde Gaza \"letterlijk verwoest\" en zei dat Amerika wil dat terugkerende bewoners zich veilig kunnen vestigen. Het is opmerkelijk dat Trump een rol voor Hamas erkent, terwijl zijn eigen vredesplan voorziet in het ontwapenen en ontmantelen van de beweging. In het twintigpuntenplan waarmee de groep akkoord is gegaan staat dat \"de ontwapening zal plaatsvinden onder toezicht van onafhankelijke waarnemers, die het proces van demilitarisering en het internationaal gefinancierde programma voor wapeninlevering en herintegratie moeten verifiëren\". Het plan belooft ook \"amnestie of vrije doorgang naar het buitenland\" voor Hamas-leden die hun wapens neerleggen. Hamas houdt vast aan wapens Achter de relatieve rust in Gaza schuilen ook toenemende spanningen tussen Hamas en gewapende clans, een van de redenen waarom de groep - ondanks internationale druk - de eis tot volledige ontwapening voorlopig van de hand wijst. Hamas-topman en voormalig minister van Volksgezondheid in Gaza, Basem Naim, zei zaterdag tegen Sky News vanuit Qatar dat de beweging haar wapens pas zal neerleggen \"als we zeker weten dat dit zal leiden tot een onafhankelijke, zelf-beschikkende staat die zichzelf kan verdedigen.\" De woorden van Naim kregen extra gewicht nadat zondag bekend werd dat zijn zoon was gedood tijdens gevechten in Gaza-Stad. Volgens het Hamas-gelieerde netwerk Quds is hij door leden van de invloedrijke Doghmush-clan in het hoofd geschoten. Ook de populaire videojournalist Saleh Aljafarawi werd dodelijk getroffen. In totaal kwamen zondag minstens 27 mensen om bij de hevige gevechten tussen Hamas en leden van de Doghmush-familie, volgens het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken in Gaza. Acht Hamas-leden werden gedood, samen met negentien clanleden. Onzekere machtsoverdracht Volgens het Amerikaanse plan moeten leden van een Internationale Stabilisatie Macht (ISF) Gaza, getraind door Jordanië en Egypte, tijdelijk beheren, totdat er een hervormde Palestijnse politie is. Maar experts waarschuwen dat de uitvoering van dit plan maanden kan duren. \"De inzet van voldoende troepen zal een enorme logistieke uitdaging worden,\" schreef denktank Chatham House vorige week. Zolang die machtsoverdracht niet is geregeld, vult Hamas het gat. De beweging heeft tientallen jaren met een uitgebreid civiel en militair bewind een ijzeren greep gehouden op Gaza. Toch brokkelt de autoriteit van Hamas af, vooral in het zuiden, waar groepen als de Popular Forces zich openlijk tegen de organisatie keren en beweren de hulpverlening beter te kunnen beschermen. Een fragiele rust Volgens het Palestijnse ministerie van Gezondheid zijn sinds het uitbreken van de oorlog in oktober 2023 ruim 67.800 mensen gedood door het Israëlische leger in Gaza, onder wie meer dan 20.000 kinderen. Terwijl de gevangenenruil en het staakt-het-vuren nog standhouden, lijken nieuwe machtsverhoudingen te ontstaan. Of Hamas zijn wapens werkelijk zal inleveren en plaatsmaakt voor een internationale politiemacht, blijft de vraag. Voorlopig patrouilleert de groep opnieuw door de straten, in naam van orde, een doel waarmee de beweging haar rol in het toekomstige Gaza veilig zal proberen te stellen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586394","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:01:01","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:38:06.853760","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":619,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4426,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Gazastrook"],"persons":["Hamas","Hamas patrouilleert","Trump","Air Force"],"locations":["Washington","Gaza","Israël"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4171,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gaza","toestemming","het staakt-het-vuren","vorige week","zijn strijders","straat","de Gazastrook","De groep","de gevechten","de afgelopen twee jaar"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gaza":2.0,"toestemming":2.0,"het staakt-het-vuren":1.0,"vorige week":1.0,"zijn strijders":1.0,"straat":1.0,"de Gazastrook":1.0,"De groep":1.0,"de gevechten":1.0,"de afgelopen twee jaar":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7218344577777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5014,"joy":0.0125,"surprise":0.0707,"sadness":0.0545,"fear":0.1866,"anger":0.118,"disgust":0.0563},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a policy action (US allowing Hamas to maintain internal security) in a conflict zone.
