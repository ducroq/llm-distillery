The system is designed to operate in the 2.45 GHz band and provides a robust and efficient alternative to conventional schemes such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). The proposed CPSK modulation enables the encoding of information for multiple users by regulating the 36 parameters of a Reconfigurable Chaotic Oscillator (RCO), theoretically allowing the simultaneous transmission of up to 224 independent users over the same channel. The CSS technique encodes each user’s information using a unique chaotic segment configuration generated by the RCO; this serves as a reference for binary symbol encoding. W-CDMA further supports the concurrent transmission of data from multiple users through orthogonal sequences, minimizing inter-user interference. The system was digitally implemented on the Artix-7 AC701 FPGA (XC7A200TFBG676-2) to evaluate logic-resource requirements, while RF validation was carried out using a ZedBoard FPGA equipped with an AD9361 transceiver. Experimental results demonstrate optimal performance in the 2.45 GHz band, confirming the effectiveness of the chaos-based W-CDMA approach as a multiuser access technique for high-spectral-density environments and its potential for use in 5G applications.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/3995","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:12.853231","language":"en","tags":["electronics","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Yuma Sandoval-Ibarra","raw_content_length":1559,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CSS","QAM","RCO","Chaos-Based Selective Symbol","Wideband Code Division Multiple Access"],"persons":["Vol","Shift Keying"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1549,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","This article","an innovative chaotic communication scheme","the multiuser access technique","Wideband Code Division Multiple Access","W-CDMA","the chaos-based selective strategy","Chaos-Based Selective Symbol","CSS"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"This article":1.0,"an innovative chaotic communication scheme":1.0,"the multiuser access technique":1.0,"Wideband Code Division Multiple Access":1.0,"W-CDMA":1.0,"the chaos-based selective strategy":1.0,"Chaos-Based Selective Symbol":1.0,"CSS":1.0}},"age_hours":12.86345344361111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8656,"joy":0.028,"surprise":0.0538,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0101,"anger":0.0263,"disgust":0.011},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel communication scheme with potential for high spectral density environments, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption in communication systems.

While GPUs offer high performance, their size, power consumption, and cost often make them unsuitable for constrained or large-scale applications. FPGAs have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, combining reconfigurability, parallelism, and increasingly favorable cost–performance ratios. They are especially relevant in domains such as robotics, IoT, and autonomous drones, where rapid sensor fusion and low power consumption are critical. This work presents the full implementation of a neural network on a low-cost FPGA, targeting real-time image and video recognition for drone applications. The workflow included training and quantizing a YOLOv3-Tiny model with Brevitas and PyTorch, converting it into hardware logic using the FINN framework, and optimizing the hardware design to maximize use of the reprogrammable silicon area and inference time. A custom driver was also developed to allow the device to operate as a TPU. The resulting accelerator, deployed on a Xilinx Zynq-7020, could recognize 208 frames per second (FPS) when running at a 200 MHz clock frequency, while consuming only 2.55 W.

However, it also introduces resonance issues that can compromise system stability. Consequently, the bandwidth of the inner current loop must be maintained well below the resonant frequency of the filter. This paper proposes a robust controller design strategy for LCL-filtered converters to extend the harmonic control range under wide variations in grid impedance. An analysis of the resonant controller phase-frequency characteristics reveals its capability to provide phase compensation up to 2π. Building on this finding, the damping ratio and phase leading angle are systematically optimized through a joint analysis of the phase characteristics introduced by the resonant controller and active damping, thereby enhancing system robustness. With these optimized parameters, the center frequency of the resonant controller can be tuned above the LCL-filter resonance frequency without inducing instability. In contrast to conventional methods, the proposed approach allows the LCL-filter to be designed with a lower resonance frequency. This enables improved attenuation of switching-frequency harmonics without compromising the tracking performance for higher-order harmonics. Such a capability is particularly beneficial in high-power and weak-grid scenarios, where the filter resonance frequency may fall to just a few hundred hertz.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_b102aff18668","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 3990: Self-Synchronized Common-Mode Current Control Strategy for Power Rebalancing in CPS","content":"Capacitor voltage imbalance among submodules in energy storage modular multilevel converters (MMCs) can lead to current distortion, power oscillations, and even system instability. Traditional voltage control strategies, inherited from non-storage MMCs, offer limited regulation capabilities and are insufficient to address the complex balancing requirements across phases, arms, and submodules in distributed Energy-Storage MMCs (ES-MMC). This paper proposes a self-synchronized common-mode current strategy to achieve capacitor voltage rebalancing in Carrier Phase-Shifted PWM (CPS-PWM) modulated ES-MMCs. The proposed method establishes both phase-level and arm-level power rebalancing pathways by utilizing the common-mode current in the upper and lower arms. Specifically, the DC component of the common-mode current is employed to regulate common-mode power between the arms, while the fundamental-frequency component, through its interaction with the fundamental modulation voltage, is used to adjust differential-mode power. By coordinating these two power components within each phase, the method enables effective capacitor voltage rebalancing among submodules in the presence of power imbalance caused by a nonuniform distributed energy storage converter.

It is a crucial scenario in 6G communications to support the Internet-of-Things. Grant-free access, where devices complete transmission without grants, is a promising scheme for MRA. In grant-free access, the design of pilot sequences has a significant effect on joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) and, consequently, system performance. Inter-user interference (IUI), caused by non-orthogonal pilots, is random owing to the random set of active users, and existing studies on pilot design for grant-free access often attempt to reduce the mean IUI. However, the performance of JADCE is affected not only by the mean IUI but also by the tail behavior of the IUI distribution. In this paper, we propose a metric for pilot design, exploiting the distribution of IUI to reflect the impact of pilots on JADCE more precisely. We further develop a pilot design algorithm based on the proposed metric, with modified approximate message passing (AMP) adopted as the JADCE algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pilot design reduces the probability of missed detection of active users and channel estimation error, compared with existing pilot designs.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/3988","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:12.855414","language":"en","tags":["electronics","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Shidong Zhou","raw_content_length":1328,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MRA","IUI"],"persons":["Vol","JADCE"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1328,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Pilot Design","the Distribution","Inter","MRA","Massive random access","massive devices","short-packet messages","a shared wireless channel"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Inter"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Pilot Design":2.0,"the Distribution":2.0,"Inter":2.0,"MRA":2.0,"Massive random access":1.0,"massive devices":1.0,"short-packet messages":1.0,"a shared wireless channel":1.0}},"age_hours":12.863569410833334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.933,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7866,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8472,"joy":0.0404,"surprise":0.0373,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0337,"anger":0.0233,"disgust":0.0134},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new pilot design algorithm for massive random access in 6G communications to improve the performance of joint activity detection and channel estimation.

However, prevailing interprovincial carbon accounting frameworks often neglect the coupled dynamics of economic benefits, energy flows, and ecological capacity, leading to systematic misattribution of industrial carbon footprint transfers. Here, we develop an integrated analytical framework combining multi-regional input–output (MRIO) modeling and net primary productivity (NPP) assessment to comprehensively quantify industrial carbon footprints and their transfers across 30 Chinese provinces. By embedding both the benefit principle (aligning responsibility with trade-generated economic gains) and the energy flow principle (accounting for interprovincial energy trade), we construct a dual-adjustment mechanism that rectifies spatial and sectoral imbalances in traditional accounting. Our results reveal pronounced east-to-west industrial carbon footprint transfers, with resource-rich provinces (e.g., Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang) disproportionately burdened by external consumption, impacting the balance of sustainable development in these regions. Implementing benefit and energy flow adjustments redistributes responsibility more fairly: high-benefit, energy-importing provinces (e.g., Shanghai, Jiangsu, Beijing) assume greater carbon obligations, while energy-exporting, resource-dependent regions see reduced responsibilities. This approach narrows the gap between production- and consumption-based accounting, offering a scientifically robust, policy-relevant pathway to balance regional development and environmental accountability. The proposed framework provides actionable insights for designing carbon compensation mechanisms and formulating equitable decarbonization policies in China and other economies facing similar regional disparities.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9036","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.076189","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Muhammad Umer Arshad","raw_content_length":1984,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NPP"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1964,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Equitable Allocation","Interprovincial Industrial Carbon Footprints","China","Economic and Energy Flow Principles","The equitable allocation","carbon emission responsibility","Chinas industrial decarbonization","its dual-carbon goals"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Equitable Allocation":2.0,"Interprovincial Industrial Carbon Footprints":2.0,"China":2.0,"Economic and Energy Flow Principles":2.0,"The equitable allocation":1.0,"carbon emission responsibility":1.0,"Chinas industrial decarbonization":1.0,"its dual-carbon goals":1.0}},"age_hours":12.863844647222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9038,"joy":0.024,"surprise":0.0148,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0236,"disgust":0.0198},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework for equitable carbon footprint allocation across Chinese provinces, considering economic benefits and energy flows.

Previous research has mainly treated person–organization (P–O) fit as a static condition assessed at entry, while little is known about its processual nature across the employee lifecycle or about how assessments relate to organizational responses to misfit. Addressing this gap, the present study examines how organizations operationalize value alignment across stages, methods, and remedial responses using original multidimensional indices. A cross-sectional survey of 104 HR managers in Poland was conducted, introducing the Fit Stage Score (assessment points across the lifecycle), the Fit Method Score (breadth of diagnostic tools), and the Misfit Response Score (remedial actions applied when misfit occurs). Results show that foreign-owned firms rely on more diverse diagnostic methods, sectoral variation appears only in the number of assessment stages, and neither executive gender nor ownership form has systematic effects. The strongest finding is the robust association between broader assessments and broader remedial measures, confirming the existence of an integrated “assessment–response bundle.” The study advances theory by providing empirical evidence for a dynamic, multidimensional view of P–O fit. Practically, it highlights that organizations can strengthen alignment by expanding assessment methods and coupling them with concrete remedial strategies such as training, mentoring, or internal mobility.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9035","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.076586","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Patrycja Paleń-Tondel","raw_content_length":1608,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Poland Value","the Misfit Response Score","the Fit Method Score"],"persons":[],"locations":["Poland"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1548,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Static Congruence","Dynamic Alignment","Person","Organization Fit Practices","Their Contribution","Sustainable HRM","Poland","organizations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Static Congruence":2.0,"Dynamic Alignment":2.0,"Person":2.0,"Organization Fit Practices":2.0,"Their Contribution":2.0,"Sustainable HRM":2.0,"Poland":2.0,"organizations":2.0}},"age_hours":12.863861533055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8779,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7395,"joy":0.0084,"surprise":0.0128,"sadness":0.0202,"fear":0.1227,"anger":0.0628,"disgust":0.0336},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study provides empirical evidence for a dynamic view of person-organization fit and its relation to sustainable HRM.

Traditional limestone coarse aggregates were partially replaced with 30% and 50% RAP aggregates; a subset of mixtures containing RAP aggregates was treated with TiO2 nanoparticles. The rheological, mechanical, and long-term properties of concrete, along with changes in its chemical composition following the addition of RAP and TiO2, were evaluated. Results revealed that using 30% and 50% RAP in concrete mixtures reduced their compressive strength by 18% and 27%, respectively. However, using TiO2 in those mixtures enhanced their compressive strength by 8.7% and 6.3%. Moreover, concrete with 50% RAP exhibited an 85% increase in water absorption (the highest among all mixtures) compared to the control. TiO2 treatment was most beneficial in the 30% RAP mixture, reducing its water absorption by 32.5% compared to its untreated counterpart. Additionally, the 30% RAP mixture treated with TiO2 showed the highest resistance to sulfates among modified mixtures, as its compressive strength decreased by 10.4% compared to a decrease of 23% in the strength of the untreated 30% RAP mixture. Statistical analysis using single-factor ANOVA showed that integrating RAP aggregates with or without the presence of TiO2 particles would significantly affect the concrete properties in terms of their population means. The t-test analysis, on the other hand, proved sufficient evidence that the mean values of the 30% RAP mixture treated with TiO2 would not differ significantly from the control in terms of its slump and water absorption properties. The chemical structure analysis revealed an increase in the Si-O-Si and Si-O functional groups when using TiO2 in RAP mixtures, suggesting improved hydration activity and accelerated C-S-H formation in the treated RAP mixtures. Moreover, distinct C-H peaks were witnessed in concrete with untreated RAP aggregates, resulting from the aged asphalt coating on the RAP, which weakened the bond between the RAP and the cementitious matrix.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9034","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.076945","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":320,"author":"Seyed Hamidreza Ghaffar","raw_content_length":2156,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.6,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RAP","TiO2"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2156,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Titanium Dioxide","Improved Performance","Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement Aggregates","Concrete","concrete","This work","an innovative approach","the performance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Titanium Dioxide":2.0,"Improved Performance":2.0,"Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement Aggregates":2.0,"Concrete":2.0,"concrete":2.0,"This work":1.0,"an innovative approach":1.0,"the performance":1.0}},"age_hours":12.863878635555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8749,"joy":0.017,"surprise":0.0224,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0035,"anger":0.0276,"disgust":0.0494},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study presents a concrete action of using TiO2 nanoparticles to enhance the performance of concrete with RAP aggregates.

Since the conventional biological treatment methods are not effective for treating tannery wastewater, the main aim of this study was to assess the performance of the electrocoagulation process (EC) in treating tannery wastewater by copper electrodes. The study was conducted through an investigation of stirring speeds (low (60 rpm), medium (780 rpm), high (1500 rpm)), current densities (4, 8, 12, and 16 mA/cm2), and reactor volume capacities (0.5, 1, 1.5 L) over an examination period of 60 min. The EC process has proven its high efficiency in removing pollutants. The results showed the best removal efficiencies, where the removal rates of COD, Cl, and Cr reached 92.3%, 96.5%, and more than 99%, respectively, at the following optimum parameters: stirring speed of 60 rpm, current density of 4 mA/cm2, and reactor volume of 1 L.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_aa4016606886","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9032: An Improved Method for Disassembly Depth Optimization of End-of","content":"Disassembly is a crucial step in the remanufacturing of end-of-life (EoL) electronic products. Disassembly depth refers to the disassembly stop point determined by the disassembly sequence. For the disassembly depth optimization of EoL electronic products, a feasibility model with a fast convergence and low mean squared error (MSE) is needed to improve optimization accuracy. However, the use of a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model or mathematical model often results in a slow convergence and high MSE due to the randomness of the initial weights and biases. In this study, an improved method for the disassembly depth optimization of smartphones based on a Particle Swarm Optimization-BPNN (PSO-BPNN) predictive model is proposed. Compared with the traditional BPNN optimization method, the proposed method in this study is that the BPNN predictive model is optimized by using PSO, which shows a superior predictive performance and reduces the MSE.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_2bb1bd001666","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9033: Determinants of the Shadow Economy—Implications for Fiscal Sustainability and Sustainable Development in the EU","content":"The shadow economy weakens fiscal sustainability, hampers the financing of public goods, and impedes the achievement of sustainable development goals. The informal sector remains a persistent challenge for policymakers, as it distorts competition, reduces transparency, and undermines the effectiveness of economic and fiscal policies. The aim of this article is to identify the key factors determining the size of the shadow economy in European Union countries and to provide policy-relevant insights. The analysis covers data on the share of the informal economy in GDP and macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita, consumer price index, average wages, household consumption, government expenditure, and unemployment, as well as indicators of digital development in society and the economy (DESI, IDT), the share of cashless transactions in GDP, and information on the implementation of digital tax administration tools and restrictions on cash payments. Five hypotheses (H1–H5) are formulated concerning the effects of income growth, labour market conditions, digitalisation, cashless payments, and tax administration tools on the shadow economy. The research question addresses which factors—macroeconomic conditions, economic and social digitalisation, payment structures, and fiscal innovations in tax administration—play the most significant role in determining the size of the shadow economy in EU countries and whether these mechanisms have broader implications for fiscal sustainability and sustainable development. The empirical strategy is based on multilevel models with countries as clusters, complemented by correlation and comparative analyses. The results indicate that the most significant factor in limiting the size of the shadow economy is the level of GDP per capita and its growth, whereas the impact of card payments appears to be superficial, reflecting overall increases in wealth. Higher wages, household consumption, and digital development as measured by the DESI also play an important role. The implementation of digital solutions in tax administration, such as SAF-T or e-PIT/pre-filled forms, along with restrictions on cash transactions, can serve as complementary measures. The findings suggest that sustainable strategies to reduce the shadow economy should combine long-term economic growth with digitalisation and improved tax administration, which may additionally foster the harmonisation of economic systems and support sustainable development.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9033","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.078002","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":347,"author":"Anna Szczepańska-Przekota","raw_content_length":2521,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.735,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DESI","the Shadow Economy—Implications","IDT","European Union"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2491,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pages","the Shadow Economy","Implications","Fiscal Sustainability","Sustainable Development","the EU","The shadow economy","fiscal sustainability","the financing","public goods"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fiscal Sustainability"],"engineering":["Sustainable Development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pages":2.0,"the Shadow Economy":2.0,"Implications":2.0,"Fiscal Sustainability":2.0,"Sustainable Development":2.0,"the EU":2.0,"The shadow economy":1.0,"fiscal sustainability":1.0,"the financing":1.0,"public goods":1.0}},"age_hours":12.863935746944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.4985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7003,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2408,"joy":0.0089,"surprise":0.0069,"sadness":0.0718,"fear":0.0745,"anger":0.2204,"disgust":0.3767},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies factors influencing the shadow economy in the EU and their implications for fiscal sustainability and sustainable development.

This study provides an ex post evaluation of the extent to which the strategy’s objectives were achieved in the member states of the EU in the period 2010–2020. The analysis is based on Eurostat data and uses Hellwig’s multidimensional comparative analysis to construct a synthetic indicator of progress. The results show that EU countries have made significant advances in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, with Sweden and Finland identified as leaders, while Malta and Hungary lagged behind. Primary energy consumption overall decreased, although only a minority of the member states reached the planned thresholds. Progress was less evident in research and development (R&D) expenditure, where the average value of the EU remained below the 3% GDP target, and strong disparities persisted between innovation leaders and weaker performers. Improvements in higher education attainment were observed, contributing to the long-term goal of a knowledge-based economy, although labour market difficulties, especially among young people, remained unresolved. The findings suggest that, although the Strategy contributed to tangible progress in several areas, uneven achievements among member states limited its overall effectiveness. The study is limited by the reliance on aggregate statistical data and a single methodological approach.

This study takes Perceived Brand Authenticity (PBA) as its focal construct and builds a chained mediation framework incorporating experiential quality (EQ) and consumer trust. Employing a dual-evidence strategy that combines structural discovery and causal validation, the study integrates Jaccard similarity clustering and PLS-SEM to examine both behavioral patterns and psychological mechanisms. Drawing on 636 valid survey responses from across China, the results reveal clear segmentation in channel choice, certification concern, and premium acceptance by gender, age, income, and education. Younger and highly educated consumers rely more on e-commerce and digital traceability, while middle-aged, older, and higher-income groups emphasize geographical indications and organic certification. The empirical analysis confirms that PBA has a significant positive effect on EQ and consumer trust, and that the chained mediation pathway “PBA → EQ → Trust → Purchase Intention” robustly captures the transmission mechanism of authenticity. The findings demonstrate that verifiable and consistent authenticity signals not only shape cross-group consumption structures but also strengthen trust and repurchase intentions through enhanced experiential quality. The core contribution of this study lies in advancing an evidence-based framework for sustainable agricultural branding. Theoretically, it reconceptualizes authenticity as a measurable governance mechanism rather than a rhetorical construct. Methodologically, it introduces a dual-evidence approach integrating Jaccard clustering and PLS-SEM to bridge structural and causal analyses. Practically, it proposes two governance tools—“evidence density” and “experiential variance”—which translate authenticity into actionable levers for precision marketing, trust management, and policy regulation. Together, these insights offer a replicable model for authenticity governance and consumer trust building in sustainable agri-food systems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9029","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.078772","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":278,"author":"Maowei Chen","raw_content_length":2286,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.39,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Construction of Trust","Perceived Brand Authenticity","PBA","the Sustainable Development of Agricultural Product Brands","Consumer Psychological Mechanisms In","PLS","Jaccard"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2169,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","The Dilemma","the Sustainable Development","Agricultural Product Brands","the Construction","Trust","An Empirical Study","Consumer Psychological Mechanisms","consumer trust"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["the Sustainable Development"],"research_academic":["An Empirical Study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Dilemma":2.0,"the Sustainable Development":2.0,"Agricultural Product Brands":2.0,"the Construction":2.0,"Trust":2.0,"An Empirical Study":2.0,"Consumer Psychological Mechanisms":2.0,"consumer trust":2.0}},"age_hours":12.86397385611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7523,"joy":0.0473,"surprise":0.0118,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.1009,"anger":0.0273,"disgust":0.0518},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study analyzes consumer behavior and trust in sustainable agricultural product brands in China.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_d7575969432b","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9028: The Manufacturers’ Adoption of Green Manufacturing Under the Government’s Green Subsidy","content":"As environmental degradation intensifies, governments increasingly subsidize green manufacturing to promote sustainability. This study develops a game-theoretic model of two competing supply chains, comprising original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and both traditional and green contract manufacturers (CMs), to investigate the impacts of subsidies on green manufacturing adoption. Specifically, we construct a four-stage dynamic game model to examine the interactions among OEMs, CMs, and the government. The main findings are as follows: First, the government subsidy affects OEMs’ adoption decisions only if the production cost of green manufacturing or competition intensity is sufficiently high or if the market sensitivity to green products is relatively low. Second, the optimal subsidy level depends jointly on the production cost of green manufacturing, competition intensity, and market greenness sensitivity: when the production cost of green manufacturing is low (high), the subsidy should rise (fall) with market greenness sensitivity but fall (rise) with competition intensity. Third, while intensified competition reduces OEMs’ profits and overall supply chain performance, its impact on CMs and consumers depends on the production cost of green manufacturing; in contrast, greater consumer sensitivity to green products yields an all–win outcome for all stakeholders. These results yield important managerial implications. For policymakers, when the production costs of green manufacturing are relatively low, green subsidies should be scaled back as market competition intensifies. For manufacturers, it is critical to carefully evaluate the production costs of green manufacturing and the level of government subsidies and to strategically pursue first-mover advantages in advancing sustainable operations, thereby fostering an all-win outcome for stakeholders.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9028","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.079122","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Yao Qiu","raw_content_length":1911,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CMs"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1881,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","The Manufacturers Adoption","Green Manufacturing","the Governments Green Subsidy","OEMs","CMs","environmental degradation intensifies","governments","green manufacturing"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Manufacturers Adoption":2.0,"Green Manufacturing":2.0,"the Governments Green Subsidy":2.0,"OEMs":2.0,"CMs":2.0,"environmental degradation intensifies":1.0,"governments":1.0,"green manufacturing":1.0}},"age_hours":12.863990225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9087,"joy":0.0152,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0052,"anger":0.0209,"disgust":0.0214},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a game-theoretic model to analyze the impact of government subsidies on green manufacturing adoption.

As these disruptions intensify, enhancing Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) has become a strategic priority. This study investigates how Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) can contribute to SCR by mitigating vulnerabilities and strengthening key capabilities within global supply chains. A qualitative research approach is employed, utilizing expert evaluations to examine DLT’s impact on supply chain vulnerabilities and capabilities. Five workshops were conducted with 25 industry professionals from logistics, IT, procurement, and risk management. Experts examined how DLT could address disruptions stemming from supplier instability, poor traceability, and regulatory and environmental pressures, while highlighting its potential to drive ethical sourcing and environmentally responsible practices. The structured discussions were guided by theoretical frameworks and expert evaluations were synthesized into two analytical matrices illustrating DLT’s influence on SCR. The findings reveal that the contribution of DLT to SCR and sustainability is highly context-dependent, with its effectiveness hinging on how it is embedded within governance structures and aligned with the interplay of complementary technologies. Building on these insights, the study presents the DLT-LFL (Distributed Ledger Technology–Learning Feedback Loop) framework, which integrates sensing, decision-making, adaptation, and predictive learning from distributed operational data, allowing supply chains to better anticipate disruptions, adjust processes dynamically, and continuously strengthen resilience and sustainable practices. The study also develops a practical checklist to assess how effective DLT applications and their integration with predictive and AI-driven analytics reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen capabilities, mitigate risks, and support adaptive decision-making.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9023","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.079492","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":257,"author":"Mehmet Akif Gulum","raw_content_length":2089,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.285,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Building Resilient and","Supply Chain Resilience","Distributed Ledger Technology","DLT","SCR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2059,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","A Distributed Ledger","SCR","Global supply chains","increasing disruptions","cyber threats","geopolitical instability","extreme weather events","a range"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Distributed Ledger":2.0,"SCR":2.0,"Global supply chains":1.0,"increasing disruptions":1.0,"cyber threats":1.0,"geopolitical instability":1.0,"extreme weather events":1.0,"a range":1.0}},"age_hours":12.864006219722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2850000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.743,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7918,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.0133,"sadness":0.0145,"fear":0.1258,"anger":0.033,"disgust":0.0121},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework (DLT-LFL) for using distributed ledger technology to improve supply chain resilience and sustainability.

While these soils have potential for recycling into construction materials, their reuse is hindered by arsenic release. This study demonstrated calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) as a highly effective additive for suppressing arsenic volatilization during soil sintering, while simultaneously improving material properties. Through comprehensive characterization using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray microtomography (μCT), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), results demonstrated that Ca(OH)2 addition (0.5–2 wt.%) reduces arsenic volatilization by 57% through formation of thermally stable calcium arsenate (Ca3(AsO4)2). Ca(OH)2 acted via two mechanisms: (a) chemical immobilization through Ca-As-O compound formation, (b) physical encapsulation in a calcium-aluminosilicate matrix during liquid-phase sintering, and (c) pH buffering that maintains arsenic in less volatile forms. Optimal performance was achieved at 0.5% Ca(OH)2, yielding 9.14 MPa compressive strength (29% increase) with minimal arsenic leaching (<110 ppb). Microstructural analysis showed Ca(OH)2 promoted densification while higher doses increased porosity. This work provides a practical solution for safe reuse of arsenic-contaminated soils, addressing both environmental concerns and material performance requirements for construction applications.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9027","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.080169","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Weipeng Feng","raw_content_length":1712,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SEM","EDS","ICP-MS","XRD","XPS"],"persons":["Fourier Transform"],"locations":["μCT"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1688,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Inhibition Mechanism","Arsenic Volatilization","Sintering","Contaminated Excavated Soils","arsenic volatilization","Urbanization","large quantities","arsenic-contaminated excavated soils"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Inhibition Mechanism":2.0,"Arsenic Volatilization":2.0,"Sintering":2.0,"Contaminated Excavated Soils":2.0,"arsenic volatilization":2.0,"Urbanization":1.0,"large quantities":1.0,"arsenic-contaminated excavated soils":1.0}},"age_hours":12.864040315,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3424,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.007,"sadness":0.0394,"fear":0.184,"anger":0.1163,"disgust":0.3058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study demonstrates a method to reduce arsenic volatilization from contaminated soils during sintering by adding calcium hydroxide.

In response, agroecology and bioeconomy are emerging as key strategies to regenerate landscapes and foster sustainable production systems. We evaluated the agroecological performance of 25 farms in the Andean–Amazon transition zone of Colombia using FAO’s Tool for Agroecology Performance Evaluation (TAPE). The analysis included land cover dynamics (2002–2024), characterization of the agroecological transition based on the 10 Elements of Agroecology, and 23 economic, environmental, and social indicators. Four farm typologies were identified; among them, Mixed Family Farms (MFF) achieved the highest transition score (CAET = 60.5%) and excelled in crop diversity (64%), soil health (SHI = 4.24), productive autonomy (VA/GVP = 0.69), and household empowerment (FMEF= 85%). Correlation analyses showed strong links between agroecological practices, economic efficiency, and social cohesion. Land cover dynamics revealed a continuous decline in forest cover (12.9% in 2002 to 7.1% in 2024) and an increase in secondary vegetation, underscoring the urgent need for restorative approaches. Overall, farms further along the agroecological transition were more productive, autonomous, and socially cohesive, strengthening territorial resilience. The application of TAPE proved robust multidimensional evidence to support agroecological monitoring and decision-making, with direct implications for land use planning, rural development strategies, and sustainability policies in the Amazon. At the same time, its sensitivity to high baseline biodiversity and to the complex socio-ecological dynamics of the Colombian Amazon underscores the need to refine the methodology in future applications. By addressing these challenges, the study contributes to the broader international debate on agroecological transitions, offering insights relevant for other tropical frontiers and biodiversity-rich regions facing similar pressures.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9024","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:47:13.080547","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":273,"author":"Pablo A.

A vast network based literature has employed functional connectivity (FC), primarily using resting-state and task-based fMRI. However, methodological limitations have hindered this approach in language processing, particularly during speech production. Here, we address this gap by employing a large cohort of electrocorticographic (ECoG) patients (N=42) to investigate the networks driving speech perception and production. We acquired data while patients were engaged in a controlled battery of speech production tasks focusing on five cognitive states (auditory perception, picture perception, reading perception, speech production, and baseline). Using linear classifiers we were able to robustly decode cognitive states from single-trial FC (i.e. Pearson correlations) of the neural activity patterns, achieving a mean accuracy of 64.4%. These classifiers revealed distinct network signatures underlying auditory and visual perception as well as speech production via stable network connectivity. Importantly, the network signatures included both regions with robust local neural activity and those with minimal or no detectable activation. Such signatures indicate that even low-activity regions contribute critically to differentiating cognitive states. Our findings underscore the significance of functional connectivity analysis as a complementary dimension to investigating local neural activity, and suggest that the functional networks supporting speech extend beyond the most metabolically active regions.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681678v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.484379","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Esmaeili, Y., Khalilian-Gourtani, A., Devinsky, O., Doyle, W., Dugan, P., Friedman, D., Flinker, A.","raw_content_length":1640,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1640,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["speech production","state specific connectivity","perception","dynamic brain networks","language perception","production","to cognitive neuroscience","A vast network based literature","functional connectivity","resting-state and task-based fMRI"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["dynamic brain networks"],"hydrogen_energy":["production"],"research_academic":["to cognitive neuroscience"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"speech production":3.0,"state specific connectivity":2.0,"perception":2.0,"dynamic brain networks":1.0,"language perception":1.0,"production":1.0,"to cognitive neuroscience":1.0,"A vast network based literature":1.0,"functional connectivity":1.0,"resting-state and task-based fMRI":1.0}},"age_hours":12.866193967777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8894,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0333,"sadness":0.0169,"fear":0.02,"anger":0.0136,"disgust":0.0213},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on understanding brain networks during speech, using ECoG data from patients.

This process is disrupted in Rett Syndrome (RTT), a regressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor, sensory, and cognitive impairments. While astrocytes typically promote neuron outgrowth, co-culture of RTT astrocytes with wildtype neurons inhibits their outgrowth, implicating secreted astrocyte factors in RTT pathology. However, the specific factors and their contributions to RTT deficits remain poorly defined. To address this, we focused on the class 3 semaphorin SEMA3C, which shows increased astrocyte secretion in RTT and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Using astrocyte and neuron cell culture, we find that SEMA3C is inhibitory to dendrite outgrowth via PLXND1 and NRP2 receptors in cortical neurons. Genetic reduction of astrocyte SEMA3C in female RTT model mice enhances dendritic arborization and normalizes synaptic activity. Behaviorally, astrocyte SEMA3C reduction normalizes visual acuity and motor behavior, which are established clinical features in RTT. Together, these findings identify astrocyte SEMA3C as a contributor to RTT pathology and highlight the SEMA3C-NRP2-PLXND1 signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in disordered neurodevelopment.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681027v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.484934","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Lyon, K.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c0b048955c48","title":"The neural computations underlying context dependent attribute","content":"Adaptive decision making requires value computations to be flexible because we often need to value a stimulus differently as the context changes. A stimulus might be highly desirable in one context but completely unappealing in another. However, it is not known how the brain can support such flexible modulation of overall stimulus value. Here we test a model of flexible value construction whereby individual attributes of a stimulus are converted into contextually dependent attribute-specific value representations before being combined into an overall integrated stimulus value. To test this framework, human participants (online n=95, MRI n=35) provided ratings for 75 unique high-dimensional clothing stimuli under three instructed `goal-contexts` designed to elicit differences in overall value judgments for the items. Integrated value ratings for each stimulus were found to be goal-context dependent, while individual stimulus-attributes varied markedly in how they contributed to value ratings across goal contexts. In the fMRI data, representations of the absolute levels of particular attributes were revealed in visual areas. In contrast, encoding of individual attributes in value space, alongside integrated overall stimulus value, was present within distinct regions of prefrontal cortex. More specifically, behaviorally relevant attributes in value space and integrated stimulus value were found in vmPFC and dmPFC respectively. These findings indicate that the construction of value for high-dimensional stimuli is achieved through the computation of goal-context-dependent attributes in value space, providing mechanistic insight into how the brain can flexibly modulate stimulus-values as context changes.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681681v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.485236","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Fransen, A., Man, V., Iigaya, K., O`Doherty, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_a89f1e191f42","title":"Shared and distinct neural signatures of inhibitory control deficits in attention","content":"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share deficits in inhibitory control, yet direct comparisons of their neurobiological underpinnings remain sparse and are often confounded by comorbidity. We examined shared and distinct abnormalities in brain activation and circuit connectivity associated with inhibitory control in non-comorbid ADHD and ASD. Methods: Brain activity and hyperdirect pathway connectivity during inhibitory control were examined in children with non-comorbid ADHD (age: 11.1{+/-}0.24y) and children with non-comorbid ASD (age: 11.1{+/-}0.39y), compared with typically developing (TD) children (age: 10.9{+/-}0.09y), and benchmarked against healthy adults (age: 24.1{+/-}1.26y), using fMRI stop-signal task data. Results: Both ADHD and ASD groups showed reduced activation in salience and frontoparietal network regions alongside increased activation in default mode network (DMN) regions, consistent with triple-network dysfunction. These activation deficits were more pronounced in ASD, whose activation profile also diverged most from adults. At the circuit level, only ASD showed abnormal hyperdirect connectivity, involving insula-STN and preSMA-STN pathways and further reflected in a composite insula/IFG-STN connectivity measure, indicating broader cortical-STN disruption. Importantly, across all children, reduced salience/frontoparietal relative to DMN engagement correlated with greater parent-reported inhibitory control deficits, and in ASD, individual differences in insula/IFG-STN connectivity showed the same association, highlighting the behavioral relevance of both network- and circuit-level abnormalities. Conclusions: ADHD and ASD share network-level but differ in circuit-level abnormalities underlying inhibitory control deficits. Together, these insights advance the neurobiology of inhibitory control in ADHD and ASD and provide potential targets for neuroscience-informed interventions addressing both shared and disorder-specific mechanisms.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681732v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.485582","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Roussat, M., Gao, Z., Cai, W., Vaidya, C., Supekar, K.","raw_content_length":2046,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Background"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2046,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["inhibitory control","Shared and distinct neural signatures","inhibitory control deficits","attention","ASD","Background","Attention-deficithyperactivity disorder","ADHD","autism spectrum disorder","deficits"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"inhibitory control":3.0,"Shared and distinct neural signatures":2.0,"inhibitory control deficits":2.0,"attention":2.0,"ASD":2.0,"Background":1.0,"Attention-deficithyperactivity disorder":1.0,"ADHD":1.0,"autism spectrum disorder":1.0,"deficits":1.0}},"age_hours":12.866251185555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3665000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5267,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8042,"joy":0.0024,"surprise":0.0576,"sadness":0.0229,"fear":0.0429,"anger":0.0217,"disgust":0.0484},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on brain activity in children with ADHD and ASD, compared to typically developing children and adults.

Social and sensory experiences shape how multisensory information is processed and integrated; however, we have less understanding of how multimodal recognition may be modulated by early sensory experience in a single modality. Zebra finches are gregarious songbirds that form lifelong pair-bonds with a single partner whom they recognize acoustically and visually. However, it is unknown to what extent multisensory signals might interact to enable recognition or whether this is affected by auditory exposure during development. In this paper, we tested females for responses to audio and visual stimuli from their mate or a stranger in a digital cross-modal expectancy violation paradigm. Using automated pose tracking, we determined that, like many species, zebra finches react differently when the stimuli are congruent versus incongruent. However, while birds reared in a colony setting and birds reared without exposure to adult song both detected audiovisual congruency, the degree of behaviors exhibited differed between the rearing conditions. Thus, multisensory integration appears to be important for females to identify their mates, but differences in developmental environment influence how recognition is behaviorally expressed.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681716v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.486420","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Catalano, I., Woolley, S.

Two studies independently identified rare deletions in ARHGAP10 (GAP10), a Rho GTPase-activating protein located at 4q31.2 in individuals with heterotaxy and atrial septal defects (n=2 rare copy number variants (CNVs)), highlighting GAP10 as a new candidate CHD gene. While the 4q31.2 locus is implicated in CHD, the function of GAP10 has not been investigated. Here, using Xenopus tropicalis as a model, we demonstrate that gap10 deletion disrupts morphogenetic movements critical for body axis extension, left-right organizer (LRO) formation, and ciliogenesis, leading to severe cardiac looping defects that closely mirror human CHD phenotypes. Moreover, gap10 localizes to basal bodies of motile cilia in multiciliated cells, where it regulates basal body organization and apical actin enrichment by recruiting focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to specialized ciliary adhesion complexes. In summary, our findings implicate GAP10 as a clinically relevant, genetically supported, and functionally validated regulator of CHD and ciliogenesis, underscoring the power of integrative functional genomics in the discovery of rare disease genes.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681676v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.486704","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Sochaka, E., Hinson, S., Shook, D., DeSimone, D., Kulkarni, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ff98a55c3183","title":"Thalamus-cortex interactions drive cell type","content":"The thalamus plays a pivotal role in the development and function of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. However, how thalamus-cortex interactions influence human cortical development remains unknown primarily because of the inaccessibility of the human embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate thalamus-dependent gene expression, circuit organization, and neural activity during corticogenesis using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs). Human cortical and thalamic organoids (hCOs and hThOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited region-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal activity. Upon the fusion of these organoids, hThCAs reconstructed reciprocal thalamus-cortex axonal projections and synaptic connections. Transcriptomic analysis revealed thalamus-dependent acceleration of cortical maturation, with upregulation of programs linked to axon development, subplate/cortical plate identity, and activity-regulated genes. Histological analysis showed expanded progenitor pools and increased deep-layer neurons within hThCAs. Wide-field Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that wave-like activity originated in the thalamic region and propagated to the cortical region. Furthermore, two-photon Ca2+ imaging of cortical neurons revealed that synchronous activity emerged exclusively in pyramidal tract (PT) and corticothalamic (CT) neurons, whereas intratelencephalic (IT) neurons remain asynchronous, highlighting cell type-specific circuit integration within hThCAs. These synchronized events were absent in isolated hCOs or in cortico-cortical assembloids, underscoring the specificity of thalamic input. Our findings suggest that diffusible thalamic cues broadly enhance progenitor expansion, while long-range thalamic input organizes cell type-specific synchronous activity. This study demonstrates the thalamus-dependent acquisition of mature cortical phenotypes in a cell type-specific manner in hThCAs, establishing developmental mechanisms linking regional interactions and cell type-specific circuit specification. Thus, hThCAs provide a tractable human platform for dissecting human-specific developmental processes and modeling neurodevelopmental disorders with disrupted thalamocortical communication at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681772v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.487021","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Nishimura, M., Adachi, S., Kodera, T., Sato, A.

However, it is not known if these alleles increase GPC at the expense of other physiologically important traits, such as senescence and yield-component traits. Here, we evaluated the effects of mutations in HB-2 on grain yield and nitrogen (N)-use efficiency as well as senescence and plant architecture in multi-environment glasshouse and field experiments. In glasshouse experiments, the mutations in HB-2 moderately improved GPC irrespective of N supply and without accelerating senescence or decreasing grain number or weight compared to the wildtype. The trait analysis indicated mutant plants were more tolerant of N limitation in terms of above-ground N reduction compared to the wild type. The expression of all HB-2 homeologues increased in spikes at the lemma primordium stage in response to N limitation, indicating the later GPC increase could be a result of enhanced N sink strength determined during early development, rather than processes caused by direct changes in HB-2 expression in the grain. In field experiments, the introgression of HB-2 alleles into Australian elite spring wheat cultivars significantly improved GPC without compromising grain yield. The outcomes of this study support the introduction of miRNA-resistant HB-2 alleles, with a preference to HB-A2, into commercial wheat for improving grain quality without a yield penalty.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681749v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.487307","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Safdar, L.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of panning of BiGEL against Siglec-7 yielded 815 candidates from which 23 hits yielded KD = 1-100 {micro}M as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) identified a subset of leads that disrupted the Siglec-7:GD3 interaction with IC50 = 3-300 {micro}M.

Alanine scans of 8c (SWCRPATVNC, IC50 = 3.8 {micro}M) and 12c (SFCHYPTHVC, IC50 = 11 {micro}M), identified key residues as crucial for activity. Ring reshaping studies of compound 8c highlighted the critical role of bicyclic topology produced by analogue 46e (SAAAAAWCRPATVNC, IC50 = 9.5 {micro}M). Multivalent display of the lead bicycles alongside ~100 glycans in Liquid glycan Array (LiGA), made it possible to compare the binding of bicycles and glycans to Siglec-7 expressed on CHO, Jurkat, and Raji cells. LiGA assays confirmed binding of the bicycles to Siglec-7 but revealed considerable non-specific interactions with receptor-negative cells. Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) revealed 46e binds to Siglec-7 at a site distinct from the V-Ig domain, suggesting it might inhibit binding of glycans to the glycan-binding site of Siglec-7 via an allosteric site. Together these results demonstrate that BiGEL enables the discovery of bicyclic peptides for undruggable Siglec targets but highlights future challenges in molecular discoveries that aim to identify small, non-carbohydrate inhibitors of GBPs.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681534v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T12:48:04.488155","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Yazdan, D., Downey, A.
