Prior works primarily focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09359","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.733698","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Eshaan Tanwar, Deepak Nathani, William Yang Wang, Tanmoy Chakraborty","raw_content_length":1414,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1413,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","the Effects","Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","specific domains","strong performance","the underlying mechanisms","which","their parametric space"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"the Effects":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"specific domains":1.0,"strong performance":1.0,"the underlying mechanisms":1.0,"which":1.0,"their parametric space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.76668715,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.791,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3582,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8146,"joy":0.0267,"surprise":0.0789,"sadness":0.0216,"fear":0.0241,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.0138},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on understanding how fine-tuning affects LLMs, specifically in the medical domain.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_525149e734e4","title":"BLINK","content":"arXiv:2510.09361v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress, particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception (\"see\") and requires fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning (\"observe\"). BLINK-Twice integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models. BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_414543670260","title":"Visibility","content":"arXiv:2510.09364v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically, achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for both static and dynamic objects.

This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton (GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09378","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.736638","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Natalie Abreu, Nikhil Vyas, Sham Kakade, Depen Morwani","raw_content_length":1235,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Potential of Second arXiv:2510.09378v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","SOAP","Gauss-Newton"],"persons":["Muon"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1234,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Potential","Second","arXiv251009378v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent efforts","LLM pretraining","computationally-efficient approximations","second-order structure","a key question","large-scale training"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM pretraining"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Potential":2.0,"Second":2.0,"arXiv251009378v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent efforts":1.0,"LLM pretraining":1.0,"computationally-efficient approximations":1.0,"second-order structure":1.0,"a key question":1.0,"large-scale training":1.0}},"age_hours":2.766793589444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6439,"joy":0.0148,"surprise":0.0238,"sadness":0.0111,"fear":0.1229,"anger":0.108,"disgust":0.0755},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores computationally efficient methods for training large language models (LLMs), achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to existing optimizers.

However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training. While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability.

To draw insights and systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation, geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for systematically designing new sequence model architectures.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09389","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.739023","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Jerome Sieber, Antonio Orvieto, Melanie N.

However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09390","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.739454","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","csma","preprints","cshc","cscl","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Mert \\.Inan, Anthony Sicilia, Alex Xie, Saujas Vaduguru, Daniel Fried, Malihe Alikhani","raw_content_length":1309,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Matplotlib"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1308,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Identifying","Interactively Refining","Ambiguous User Goals","Data Visualization Code Generation","ambiguities","Announce Type","new Abstract","shared goals","a fundamental step","human-AI communication"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["human-AI communication"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Identifying":2.0,"Interactively Refining":2.0,"Ambiguous User Goals":2.0,"Data Visualization Code Generation":2.0,"ambiguities":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"shared goals":1.0,"a fundamental step":1.0,"human-AI communication":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7668993480555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8822,"joy":0.0062,"surprise":0.0191,"sadness":0.0196,"fear":0.019,"anger":0.0256,"disgust":0.0283},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of data visualization code generation through multi-turn dialogue, which could indirectly support sustainability efforts by making data analysis more efficient and accessible.

Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially during late-stage learning. HyGO integrates the global exploration capabilities of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration and exploitation. For parametric problems, HyGO alternates between a genetic algorithm and targeted improvement through a degradation-proof Dowhill Simplex Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HyGO rotates between genetic programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation benchmarks, where HyGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HyGO emerges as a versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional learning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09391","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.739870","language":"en","tags":["csne","research","preprints","computer-science","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Isaac Robledo, Yiqing Li, Guy Y.

However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_595deb86f50d","title":"TIT: A Tree","content":"arXiv:2510.09400v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets, resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09400","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.741531","language":"en","tags":["csse","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"He Jiang, Yufu Wang, Hao Lin, Peiyu Zou, Zhide Zhou, Ang Jia, Xiaochen Li, Zhilei Ren","raw_content_length":1902,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tree","LLM","TIT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1901,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["TIT","A Tree","arXiv251009400v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","LLMs","strong performance","target","extensive code corpora","mainstream LLM-based code translation methods"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"TIT":2.0,"A Tree":2.0,"arXiv251009400v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"strong performance":1.0,"target":1.0,"extensive code corpora":1.0,"mainstream LLM-based code translation methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7669793858333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.408,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7184,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8619,"joy":0.0026,"surprise":0.015,"sadness":0.045,"fear":0.0132,"anger":0.0163,"disgust":0.046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method (TIT) for improving code translation using LLMs, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption by optimizing software development processes.

This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of \"reasoning\" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09404","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.741930","language":"en","tags":["csai","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Christian Bluethgen, Dave Van Veen, Daniel Truhn, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Michael Moor, Malgorzata Polacin, Akshay Chaudhari, Thomas Frauenfelder, Curtis P.

However, how to capture the time-varying and dynamic characteristics of multi-dimensional resources is challenging for efficient collaborative scheduling. Motivated by this factor, we design a highly succinct multi-dimensional resource time-expanded graph (MDR-TEG) modell. Specifically, by employing a slots division mechanism and introducing an external virtual node, the time-varying communication, caching, and computing (3C) resources are depicted in low complexity by the link weights within, between, and outside the slots. Based on the MDR-TEG, the maximizing successful transmission ratio of TDI (MSTR-TDI) is modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Which further relaxed decomposed into two tractable sub-problems: maximizing the successful transmission rate of images (MSTRI) and ensuring the timeliness problem (ETP). Subsequently, an efficient subgradient of relaxation computing constraint (SRCC) algorithm is proposed. The upper and lower bounds of MSTR-TDI are obtained by solving the two subproblems and the dual problem (DP), and the direction of the next iteration is obtained by feedback. Furthermore, arranging the sending sequences of images to improve the quality of the solution. The approximate optimal solution of MSTR-TDI is eventually obtained through repeated iterations. The simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed MDR-TEG model and the effectiveness of the SRCC.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09409","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.743150","language":"en","tags":["research","mathit","preprints","eesssy","cssy","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Chongxiao Cai, Yan Zhu, Min Sheng, Jiandong Li, Yan Shi, Di Zhou, Ziwen Xie, Chen Zhang","raw_content_length":1724,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MSTR","TDI","LEO"],"persons":[],"locations":["node"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1723,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["3C Resources Joint Allocation","Time","OSs","arXiv251009409v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Low-Earth-orbit LEO satellites","observation satellites","more time-determined images","TDI","a new paradigm"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"3C Resources Joint Allocation":2.0,"Time":2.0,"OSs":2.0,"arXiv251009409v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Low-Earth-orbit LEO satellites":1.0,"observation satellites":1.0,"more time-determined images":1.0,"TDI":1.0,"a new paradigm":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7670399722222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.982,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7964,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9099,"joy":0.0052,"surprise":0.0369,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0123,"anger":0.0236,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel algorithm for optimizing resource allocation in LEO satellite networks to improve image transmission.

However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09416","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.743934","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cssi","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Abigail J.

In this paper, a mathematical lattice structure is employed to represent and partition the state space of power system. Based on this structure, a novel recursive method is proposed to efffciently identify critical states by leveraging lattice partitioning and Optimal Power Flow(OPF) calculations. This method not only enables the extension of failure system states,but also calculates the upper and lower bounds of the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) in a progressively converging manner. Compared to traditional reliability assessment methods such as State Enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), this approach offers greater accuracy and efffciency.

Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs) internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual LLM research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09426","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.747080","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Minjun Kim, Hyeonseok Lim, Hangyeol Yoo, Inho Won, Seungwoo Song, Minkyung Cho, Junhun Yuk, Changsu Choi, Dongjae Shin, Huige Lee, Hoyun Song, Alice Oh, Kyungtae Lim","raw_content_length":1362,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1361,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["KORMo","Korean Open Reasoning Model","Everyone","Announce Type","new Abstract","This work","the first large-scale investigation","LLM","a non-English language","synthetic data"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"KORMo":2.0,"Korean Open Reasoning Model":2.0,"Everyone":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This work":1.0,"the first large-scale investigation":1.0,"LLM":1.0,"a non-English language":1.0,"synthetic data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7671906411111107,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8734,"joy":0.0335,"surprise":0.0457,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0144,"anger":0.0164,"disgust":0.0136},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the use of synthetic data for training large language models, specifically for Korean.

Determining the existence of a stable cutset in a graph is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we introduce a new exact algorithm for Stable Cutset. By branching on graph configurations and using the $O^*(1.3645)$ algorithm for the (3,2)-Constraint Satisfaction Problem presented by Beigel and Eppstein, we achieve an improved running time of $O^*(1.2972^n)$. In addition, we investigate the Stable Cutset problem for graphs with a bound on the minimum degree $\\delta$. First, we show that if the minimum degree of a graph $G$ is at least $\\frac{2}{3}(n-1)$, then $G$ does not contain a stable cutset. Furthermore, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs where $\\delta \\geq \\tfrac{1}{2}n$, and a similar kernelisation algorithm for graphs where $\\delta = \\tfrac{1}{2}n - k$. Finally, we prove that Stable Cutset remains NP-complete for graphs with minimum degree $c$, where $c > 1$. We design an exact algorithm for this problem that runs in $O^*(\\lambda^n)$ time, where $\\lambda$ is the positive root of $x^{\\delta + 2} - x^{\\delta + 1} + 6$. This algorithm can also be applied to the \\textsc{3-Colouring} problem with the same minimum degree constraint, leading to an improved exact algorithm as well.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09432","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.747843","language":"en","tags":["csds","research","cscc","csdm","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Mats Vroon, Hans L.

In practice, however, its anonymity can be undermined by user behaviour and operational quirks. We conduct the first cross-chain empirical study of Tornado Cash activity on Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon, introducing three clustering heuristics-(i) address-reuse, (ii) transactional-linkage, and (iii) a novel first-in-first-out (FIFO) temporal-matching rule. Together, these heuristics reconnect deposits to withdrawals and deanonymise a substantial share of recipients. Our analysis shows that 5.1 - 12.6% of withdrawals can already be traced to their originating deposits through address reuse and transactional linkage heuristics. Adding our novel First-In-First-Out (FIFO) temporal-matching heuristic lifts the linkage rate by a further 15 - 22 percentage points. Statistical tests confirm that these FIFO matches are highly unlikely to occur by chance. Comparable leakage across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, and Polygon indicates chain-agnostic user misbehaviour, rather than chain-specific protocol flaws. These results expose how quickly cryptographic guarantees can unravel in everyday use, underscoring the need for both disciplined user behaviour and privacy-aware protocol design. In total, our heuristics link over $2.3 billion in Tornado Cash withdrawals to identifiable deposits, exposing significant cracks in practical anonymity.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09433","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.748245","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","preprints","computer-science","cset","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Raffaele Cristodaro, Benjamin Kramer, Claudio J.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_4c18a9f008c2","title":"Domain","content":"arXiv:2510.09434v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However, large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09434","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.748682","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Xixi Wang, Jordanka Kovaceva, Miguel Costa, Shuai Wang, Francisco Camara Pereira, Robert Thomson","raw_content_length":1936,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bidirectional Encoder Representations","Crash Type","Transformer","BERT","Domain arXiv:2510.09434v1"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1935,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Domain","Announce Type","new Abstract","Free-text crash narratives","real-world crash databases","a significant role","traffic safety","large-scale analyses","no documented tools","process"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Domain","process"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Domain":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Free-text crash narratives":1.0,"real-world crash databases":1.0,"a significant role":1.0,"traffic safety":1.0,"large-scale analyses":1.0,"no documented tools":1.0,"process":1.0}},"age_hours":2.767248613611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9292,"joy":0.013,"surprise":0.0345,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0059,"disgust":0.004},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores using compact open-source PLMs to improve traffic safety analysis by extracting information from crash narratives.

The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor, a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally, targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and temporal coherence.

However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and workforce development. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also trustworthy, safe, and sustainable.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09439","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.749891","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cscy","eesssy","cssy","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Fanfan Lin, Peter Wilson, Xinze Li, Alan Mantooth","raw_content_length":1367,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Power Electronics","Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency","Energy Sustainability","IEEE Power Electronics Society"],"persons":["Evolving Roles of Engineers"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1366,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Demystifying and Navigating AI Ethics","Power Electronics","power electronics","Announce Type","new Abstract","Artificial intelligence","AI-related publications","IEEE Power Electronics Society","journals","the ethical dimensions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Demystifying and Navigating AI Ethics","Artificial intelligence"],"research_academic":["AI-related publications","journals"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Demystifying and Navigating AI Ethics":2.0,"Power Electronics":2.0,"power electronics":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Artificial intelligence":1.0,"AI-related publications":1.0,"IEEE Power Electronics Society":1.0,"journals":1.0,"the ethical dimensions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7672941041666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.4895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8979,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.815,"joy":0.0241,"surprise":0.0156,"sadness":0.0105,"fear":0.0458,"anger":0.0404,"disgust":0.0487},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the ethical integration of AI in power electronics, focusing on security, explainability, sustainability, and engineer roles.

The hysteresis, the nonlinearity in the piezoelectric material, degrades the precision in tracking references with high frequency contents and different travel ranges. The hysteresis compensation by the inverse model, as the state-of-the-art solution, is not reliable alone. Therefore, a control framework with robustness against the remaining nonlinearity is needed. It is shown that there is an unavoidable limitation in robust linear control design to improve the performance. A robust control methodology based on a complex-order element is established to relax the limitation. Then, a constant-in-gain-lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset controller is utilized to realize the complex-order control. The control design is based on the sinusoidal input describing function (SIDF) and the higher-order SIDF (HOSIDF) tools. A constrained optimization problem is provided to tune the control parameters. The achieved improvements by the CgLp control is validated by the simulation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09445","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.751066","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","eesssy","cssy","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Ashkan Sebghati, S.

Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches. Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures. Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09452","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.752411","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Faried Abu Zaid, Tim Katzke, Emmanuel M\\\"uller, Daniel Neider","raw_content_length":1522,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["USF","Deep SVDD"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1521,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Uniformly Scaling Flows","arXiv251009452v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Unsupervised anomaly detection","around two widely studied paradigms","Deep one-class classification","Deep SVDD","compact latent representations","normality","density estimators"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Uniformly Scaling Flows"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Uniformly Scaling Flows":2.0,"arXiv251009452v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Unsupervised anomaly detection":1.0,"around two widely studied paradigms":1.0,"Deep one-class classification":1.0,"Deep SVDD":1.0,"compact latent representations":1.0,"normality":1.0,"density estimators":1.0}},"age_hours":2.767388805833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9204,"joy":0.0119,"surprise":0.0394,"sadness":0.0033,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical advancement in unsupervised anomaly detection using uniformly scaling flows (USFs).

Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP) of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP of only 35.69%.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_46ef786bc8ba","title":"Failure Prediction at Runtime for Generative Robot Policies","content":"arXiv:2510.09459v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However, distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators, aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards more interpretable and safer generative robot policies.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_66ca085ada2c","title":"Adaptive Attacks on Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols","content":"arXiv:2510.09462v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09462","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.753668","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Mikhail Terekhov, Alexander Panfilov, Daniil Dzenhaliou, Caglar Gulcehre, Maksym Andriushchenko, Ameya Prabhu, Jonas Geiping","raw_content_length":1416,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1415,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive Attacks","Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols","arXiv251009462v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","AI control protocols","a defense mechanism","untrusted LLM agents","harm","autonomous settings","a security problem"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols"],"healthcare_tech":["harm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive Attacks":2.0,"Trusted Monitors Subvert AI Control Protocols":2.0,"arXiv251009462v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"AI control protocols":1.0,"a defense mechanism":1.0,"untrusted LLM agents":1.0,"harm":1.0,"autonomous settings":1.0,"a security problem":1.0}},"age_hours":2.767435161388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7045000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8591,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4064,"joy":0.003,"surprise":0.0065,"sadness":0.029,"fear":0.157,"anger":0.2301,"disgust":0.1681},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies a vulnerability in AI control protocols that could allow untrusted LLMs to bypass safety measures.

Traditional centralized algorithms that have global information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely, distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios having higher agent counts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09469","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.755315","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","csma","preprints","csro","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Bharath Muppasani, Ritirupa Dey, Biplav Srivastava, Vignesh Narayanan","raw_content_length":1514,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CBS","Conflict-Based Search","Scalable Multi arXiv:2510.09469v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1513,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Scalable Multi","conflicts","arXiv251009469v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Multi-agent pathfinding","MAPF","a critical problem","robotics","autonomous systems","agents"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Scalable Multi":2.0,"conflicts":2.0,"arXiv251009469v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multi-agent pathfinding":1.0,"MAPF":1.0,"a critical problem":1.0,"robotics":1.0,"autonomous systems":1.0,"agents":1.0}},"age_hours":2.767494783888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.6475,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6705,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.841,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0316,"sadness":0.0161,"fear":0.0309,"anger":0.0457,"disgust":0.0274},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a hybrid multi-agent pathfinding framework using reinforcement learning and a centralized coordinator.

In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.

We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09472","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.756157","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cscl","cslo","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Manuel Vargas Guzm\\'an, Jakub Szymanik, Maciej Malicki","raw_content_length":1715,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1714,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hybrid Models","Natural Language Reasoning","The Case","Syllogistic Logic","Announce Type","new Abstract","the remarkable progress","neural models","their ability","a cornerstone"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hybrid Models":2.0,"Natural Language Reasoning":2.0,"The Case":2.0,"Syllogistic Logic":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the remarkable progress":1.0,"neural models":1.0,"their ability":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7675266169444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.5275,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5055,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8311,"joy":0.0243,"surprise":0.094,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0183,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0086},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores hybrid AI models for logical reasoning, specifically syllogistic logic.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_79cf68e79ee8","title":"Multimodal Policy Internalization for Conversational Agents","content":"arXiv:2510.09474v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_12359445ed7c","title":"Site-Level Fine","content":"arXiv:2507.12269v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a69948c73ad2","title":"Locally Optimal Private Sampling: Beyond the Global Minimax","content":"arXiv:2510.09485v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in $f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class $\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this, we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$. Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of $f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09485","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.758991","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","mathit","preprints","cscy","cslg","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Hrad Ghoukasian, Bonwoo Lee, Shahab Asoodeh","raw_content_length":1688,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LDP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$P_0$","close to $P$"]},"char_count":1687,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Locally Optimal Private Sampling","the Global Minimax","a distribution","LDP","arXiv251009485v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the problem","local differential privacy","a private distribution","P in mathcalP"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Locally Optimal Private Sampling":2.0,"the Global Minimax":2.0,"a distribution":2.0,"LDP":2.0,"arXiv251009485v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"local differential privacy":1.0,"a private distribution":1.0,"P in mathcalP":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7676318372222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9184,"joy":0.0229,"surprise":0.0274,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0122,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to private data sampling, focusing on local minimax optimality.

Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy variance $\\sigma^2$.

About 10% of the global population is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing values; those are filled in using \"mean-mode\" and \"Random sampling method\" strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99% accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09493","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.760654","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Iftekhar Ahmed, Tanzil Ebad Chowdhury, Biggo Bushon Routh, Nafisa Tasmiya, Shadman Sakib, Adil Ahmed Chowdhury","raw_content_length":1558,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Machine Learning","UCL"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1557,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Performance Analysis","Machine Learning Algorithms","Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction","CKD","new Abstract","Kidneys","the filter","the human body","About 10","the global population"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine Learning Algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Performance Analysis":2.0,"Machine Learning Algorithms":2.0,"Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction":2.0,"CKD":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Kidneys":1.0,"the filter":1.0,"the human body":1.0,"About 10":1.0,"the global population":1.0}},"age_hours":2.767693003333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2338,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0089,"sadness":0.0226,"fear":0.7122,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0068},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms for predicting chronic kidney disease.

While current security tools are addressing network and API security, the challenge of securing granular data access remains. Removing standing permissions at the data level is as critical as it is at the network level, especially for companies handling valuable data at scale. In this white paper, we introduce an innovative architecture based on on-demand data enclaves to address this gap directly. Our approach enables Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) principles at the data level. We replace static permissions with temporary data contracts that enforce proactive protection. This means separation is built around the data requested on-demand, providing precise access and real time monitoring for individual records instead of datasets.

Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries.

However,existing physics-based and data-driven models often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data. We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States, Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental monitoring and decision-making.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09500","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.762685","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Shiyuan Luo, Runlong Yu, Shengyu Chen, Yingda Fan, Yiqun Xie, Yanhua Li, Xiaowei Jia","raw_content_length":1601,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1600,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Geo","arXiv251009500v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Understanding environmental ecosystems","the sustainable management","our planet","existing physics-based and data-driven models","varying spatial regions","scales","the inherent data heterogeneity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the sustainable management"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Geo":2.0,"arXiv251009500v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Understanding environmental ecosystems":1.0,"the sustainable management":1.0,"our planet":1.0,"existing physics-based and data-driven models":1.0,"varying spatial regions":1.0,"scales":1.0,"the inherent data heterogeneity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7677707525,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.5305,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7472,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0181,"sadness":0.0698,"fear":0.0147,"anger":0.0987,"disgust":0.0455},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework (Geo-STARS) for predicting stream water temperature.

While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding.

MRMR contains 1,502 queries spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements. First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise, enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in more realistic and challenging scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09510","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.764263","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csir","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Siyue Zhang, Yuan Gao, Xiao Zhou, Yilun Zhao, Tingyu Song, Arman Cohan, Anh Tuan Luu, Chen Zhao","raw_content_length":1533,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Contradiction Retrieval","MRMR"],"persons":["MRMR"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1532,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MRMR","Expert","arXiv251009510v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","intensive reasoning","1502 queries","23 domains","positive documents","human experts","prior benchmarks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["23 domains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MRMR":5.0,"Expert":2.0,"arXiv251009510v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"intensive reasoning":1.0,"1502 queries":1.0,"23 domains":1.0,"positive documents":1.0,"human experts":1.0,"prior benchmarks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7678328225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8918,"joy":0.0216,"surprise":0.06,"sadness":0.0026,"fear":0.0075,"anger":0.0123,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article introduces a new multimodal retrieval benchmark (MRMR) for AI models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3a0f654d7066","title":"Parameterized Algorithms for Diversity of Networks with Ecological Dependencies","content":"arXiv:2510.09512v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: For a phylogenetic tree, the phylogenetic diversity of a set A of taxa is the total weight of edges on paths to A. Finding small sets of maximal diversity is crucial for conservation planning, as it indicates where limited resources can be invested most efficiently. In recent years, efficient algorithms have been developed to find sets of taxa that maximize phylogenetic diversity either in a phylogenetic network or in a phylogenetic tree subject to ecological constraints, such as a food web. However, these aspects have mostly been studied independently. Since both factors are biologically important, it seems natural to consider them together. In this paper, we introduce decision problems where, given a phylogenetic network, a food web, and integers k, and D, the task is to find a set of k taxa with phylogenetic diversity of at least D under the maximize all paths measure, while also satisfying viability conditions within the food web. Here, we consider different definitions of viability, which all demand that a \"sufficient\" number of prey species survive to support surviving predators. We investigate the parameterized complexity of these problems and present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms. Specifically, we provide a complete complexity dichotomy characterizing which combinations of parameters - out of the size constraint k, the acceptable diversity loss D, the scanwidth of the food web, the maximum in-degree in the network, and the network height h - lead to W[1]-hardness and which admit FPT algorithms. Our primary methodological contribution is a novel algorithmic framework for solving phylogenetic diversity problems in networks where dependencies (such as those from a food web) impose an order, using a color coding approach.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09512","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.764704","language":"en","tags":["csds","research","preprints","mathco","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":279,"author":"Mark Jones, Jannik Schestag","raw_content_length":1825,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.395,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["A.

While prior work has proposed measures based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets, spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings: ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09519","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.766202","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Veronica Rammouz, Aaron Gonzalez, Carlos Cruzportillo, Adrian Tan, Nicole Beebe, Anthony Rios","raw_content_length":1129,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NLP","GeoOLID","Labeled Data"],"persons":["Domains","Announce Type","Model Performance"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1128,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Can We Reliably Rank Model Performance","Domains","Labeled Data","arXiv251009519v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Estimating model performance","labels","an important goal","NLP models","prior work"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Domains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Can We Reliably Rank Model Performance":2.0,"Domains":2.0,"Labeled Data":2.0,"arXiv251009519v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Estimating model performance":1.0,"labels":1.0,"an important goal":1.0,"NLP models":1.0,"prior work":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7679047894444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.742,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8995,"joy":0.0159,"surprise":0.0563,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0074,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes methods for estimating NLP model performance without labels, using LLMs to predict errors.
