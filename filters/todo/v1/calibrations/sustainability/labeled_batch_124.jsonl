In this paper, we propose a novel NLP-based framework that harnesses the vast, abundant, and inexpensive data available on social media platforms like Twitter to understand users' perceptions of various service issues. Twitter, being a microblogging platform, hosts a wealth of real-time user-generated content that often includes valuable feedback and opinions on various products, services, and experiences. The proposed framework streamlines the process of gathering and analyzing user feedback without the need for costly and time-consuming user feedback surveys using two techniques. First, it utilizes few-shot learning for tweet classification within predefined categories, allowing effective identification of the issues described in tweets. It then employs a lexicon-based sentiment analysis model to assess the intensity and polarity of the tweet sentiments, distinguishing between positive, negative, and neutral tweets. The effectiveness of the framework was validated on a subset of manually labeled Twitter data and was applied to the NYC subway system as a case study. The framework accurately classifies tweets into predefined categories related to safety, reliability, and maintenance of the subway system and effectively measured sentiment intensities within each category. The general findings were corroborated through a comparison with an agency-run customer survey conducted in the same year. The findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed framework in gauging user feedback through inexpensive social media data to understand the pain points of the transit system and plan for targeted improvements.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07086","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.073345","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","research","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Adway Das, Abhishek Kumar Prajapati, Pengxiang Zhang, Mukund Srinath, Andisheh Ranjbari","raw_content_length":1815,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NLP"],"persons":["Twitter"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1814,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Twitter Data","Sentiment Analysis","Transit User Feedback","An NLP Framework","Twitter","Announce Type","Abstract","Traditional methods","user feedback","transit surveys"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["An NLP Framework"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Twitter Data":2.0,"Sentiment Analysis":2.0,"Transit User Feedback":2.0,"An NLP Framework":2.0,"Twitter":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Traditional methods":1.0,"user feedback":1.0,"transit surveys":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7626799627777774,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9111,"joy":0.014,"surprise":0.0364,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0075,"anger":0.0144,"disgust":0.0098},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed NLP framework analyzing Twitter data to understand transit user feedback.

In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08045","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.073767","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Iman Askari, Ali Vaziri, Xuemin Tu, Shen Zeng, Huazhen Fang","raw_content_length":1433,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State arXiv:2310.08045v5 Announce Type","MPIC","MPC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1432,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Model Predictive Inferential Control","Neural State","arXiv231008045v5 Announce Type","Abstract","Model predictive control","MPC","safe and optimal motion planning","autonomous vehicles","this paper","MPC-based motion planning"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Model Predictive Inferential Control":2.0,"Neural State":2.0,"arXiv231008045v5 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Model predictive control":1.0,"MPC":1.0,"safe and optimal motion planning":1.0,"autonomous vehicles":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"MPC-based motion planning":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7626963055555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9001,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9152,"joy":0.0251,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0139,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel control method (MPIC) for autonomous vehicles using neural state-space models, which could potentially improve efficiency and safety, leading to reduced energy consumption and emissions.

Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. These hypergraphs offer a natural platform for organizing, communicating, and processing computational knowledge. While most scientific problems can be framed as the data-driven discovery of unknown functions in a computational hypergraph whose structure is known (Type 2), many require the data-driven discovery of the structure (connectivity) of the hypergraph itself (Type 3). We introduce an interpretable Gaussian Process (GP) framework for such (Type 3) problems that does not require randomization of the data, access to or control over its sampling, or sparsity of the unknown functions in a known or learned basis. Its polynomial complexity, which contrasts sharply with the super-exponential complexity of causal inference methods, is enabled by the nonlinear ANOVA capabilities of GPs used as a sensing mechanism.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17007","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.074590","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","csai","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Th\\'eo Bourdais, Pau Batlle, Xianjin Yang, Ricardo Baptista, Nicolas Rouquette, Houman Owhadi","raw_content_length":1691,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["arXiv:2311.17007v2 Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1690,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Codiscovering graphical structure","functional relationships","data","A Gaussian Process framework","the dots","arXiv231117007v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Most problems","the scientific domain","the following three levels"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Codiscovering graphical structure":2.0,"functional relationships":2.0,"data":2.0,"A Gaussian Process framework":2.0,"the dots":2.0,"arXiv231117007v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Most problems":1.0,"the scientific domain":1.0,"the following three levels":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7627275844444448,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.7119999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4576,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8458,"joy":0.011,"surprise":0.0935,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0168,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0093},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for discovering relationships within data, potentially applicable to various scientific domains.

Despite the progress in the past decades, existing practice in causal discovery (CD) heavily relies on high-quality measured variables, which are usually given by human experts. In fact, the lack of well-defined high-level variables behind unstructured data has been a longstanding roadblock to a broader real-world application of CD. This procedure can naturally benefit from an automated process that can suggest potential hidden variables in the system. Interestingly, Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive observations of the world and have demonstrated great capability in processing unstructured data. To leverage the power of LLMs, we develop a new framework termed Causal representatiOn AssistanT (COAT) that incorporates the rich world knowledge of LLMs to propose useful measured variables for CD with respect to high-value target variables on their paired unstructured data. Instead of directly inferring causality with LLMs, COAT constructs feedback from intermediate CD results to LLMs to refine the proposed variables. Given the target variable and the paired unstructured data, we first develop COAT-MB that leverages the predictivity of the proposed variables to iteratively uncover the Markov Blanket of the target variable. Built upon COAT-MB, COAT-PAG further extends to uncover a more complete causal graph, i.e., Partial Ancestral Graph, by iterating over the target variables and actively seeking new high-level variables. Moreover, the reliable CD capabilities of COAT also extend the debiased causal inference to unstructured data by discovering an adjustment set. We establish theoretical guarantees for the CD results and verify their efficiency and reliability across realistic benchmarks and real-world case studies.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03941","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.077025","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","preprints","statme","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Chenxi Liu, Yongqiang Chen, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong, James Cheng, Bo Han, Kun Zhang","raw_content_length":1932,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COAT"],"persons":["Causal"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1931,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Discovering","Reasoning","Causality","the Hidden World","Large Language Models","arXiv240203941v3 Announce Type","Abstract","hidden causal variables","the underlying causal mechanisms","the development"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"],"engineering":["the development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Discovering":2.0,"Reasoning":2.0,"Causality":2.0,"the Hidden World":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv240203941v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"hidden causal variables":1.0,"the underlying causal mechanisms":1.0,"the development":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762818691666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1895,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5621,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8781,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0335,"sadness":0.0187,"fear":0.0126,"anger":0.0199,"disgust":0.0305},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new framework (COAT) using LLMs to discover hidden causal variables for causal discovery.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d0b329073ad0","title":"DeAL: Decoding","content":"arXiv:2402.06147v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are nowadays expected to generate content aligned with human preferences. Current work focuses on alignment at model training time, through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, it is unclear if such methods are an effective choice to teach alignment objectives to the model. First, the inability to incorporate multiple, custom rewards and reliance on a model developer's view of universal and static principles are key limitations. Second, the reliability of such approaches is also questionable (e.g. susceptibility to jailbreaking even after safety training). To address these issues, we propose DeAL, a framework that allows the user to customize reward functions and enables Decoding-time Alignment of LLMs (DeAL). At its core, we view decoding as a heuristic-guided search process and facilitate the use of a wide variety of alignment objectives. Our experiments with programmatic constraints such as keyword and length constraints, and abstract objectives such as harmlessness and helpfulness, show that we can DeAL with fine-grained trade-offs and improve adherence to alignment objectives. Lastly, we demonstrate that DeAL is largely complementary to existing alignment strategies, and can be effectively paired with RLHF and prompting techniques to achieve better alignment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06147","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.077415","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"James Y.

Most existing studies instruct LLMs to perform code translation and evaluate their performance by either running the generated outputs through test suites or comparing them to reference outputs (ground truth). These outputs, however, may contain not only executable source code but also additional non-code elements, such as natural language explanations or formatting tokens. We refer to the combination of source code and non-code elements as the output format. It is crucial to understand and address variations in output format, as non-code elements can interfere with evaluation metrics, resulting in biased assessments of model performance and comparisons. We conduct an empirical analysis of the outputs from eleven instruct-tuned open-source LLMs, across five PLs: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. The results show that between 26.4% and 73.7% of outputs produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing. To mitigate output format bias, we propose a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expressions that effectively extracts source code from mixed-format outputs, enabling the eleven open-source models to achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our empirical study confirms that output format bias affects widely used execution-based metrics, i.e., Computational Accuracy (CA), and text-based metrics, i.e., BLEU, CodeBLEU and CrystalBLEU. Additionally, we test five closed-source LLMs and observe that they also generate varying distributions of output formats, which could lead to output format biases. Our results highlight the need to mitigate the output format bias to enable reliable evaluations in LLMs for code translation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17214","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.078219","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Marcos Macedo, Yuan Tian, Filipe R.

This has also raised security concerns on social media, as malicious users can create and disseminate harmful content. Existing approaches typically involve training specific components or entire generative models to embed a watermark in generated images for traceability and responsibility. However, in the fast-evolving era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the rapid iteration and modification of LDMs makes retraining with watermark models costly. To address the problem, we propose MarkPlugger, a generalizable plug-and-play watermark framework without LDM retraining. In particular, to reduce the disturbance of the watermark on the semantics of the generated image, we try to identify a watermark representation that is approaching orthogonal to the semantic in latent space, and apply an additive fusion strategy for the watermark and the semantic. Without modifying any components of the LDMs, we embed diverse watermarks in latent space, adapting to the denoising process. Our experimental findings reveal that our method effectively harmonizes image quality and watermark recovery rate. We also have validated that our method is generalized to multiple official versions and modified variants of LDMs, even without retraining the watermark model. Furthermore, it performs robustly under various attacks of different intensities.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05607","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.079023","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Guokai Zhang, Lanjun Wang, Yuting Su, An-An Liu","raw_content_length":1510,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LDM","MarkPlugger"],"persons":["Retraining arXiv:2404.05607v2 Announce"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1509,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MarkPlugger","Generalizable Watermark Framework","Latent Diffusion Models","arXiv240405607v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the family","latent diffusion models","LDMs","prominence","its high quality outputs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MarkPlugger":2.0,"Generalizable Watermark Framework":2.0,"Latent Diffusion Models":2.0,"arXiv240405607v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the family":1.0,"latent diffusion models":1.0,"LDMs":1.0,"prominence":1.0,"its high quality outputs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762894363055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.634500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7269,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7116,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0198,"sadness":0.0106,"fear":0.1406,"anger":0.0885,"disgust":0.02},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for watermarking AI-generated images without retraining models.

However, current map vector estimation pipelines face two key limitations: input-agnostic queries struggle to capture complex map structures, and the view transformation leads to information loss. These issues often result in inaccurate shape restoration or missing instances in map predictions. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach, namely \\textbf{PerCMap}, which explicitly exploits clues from perspective-view features at both instance and point level. Specifically, at instance level, we propose Cross-view Instance Activation (CIA) to activate instance queries across surround-view images, thereby helping the model recover the instance attributes of map vectors. At point level, we design Dual-view Point Embedding (DPE), which fuses features from both views to generate input-aware positional embeddings and improve the accuracy of point coordinate estimation.

However, due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniRGB-IR, a scalable and efficient framework for RGB-IR semantic tasks that introduces a novel adapter mechanism to effectively incorporate rich multi-modal features into pre-trained RGB-based foundation models. Our framework comprises three key components: a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module, and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features.

We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each \"layer\" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00313","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.081408","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Peyman Gholami, Robert Xiao","raw_content_length":1301,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Layered Diffusion Brushes arXiv:2405.00313v2 Announce Type","LDB"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1300,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Layered Diffusion Brushes","Image Editing","LDB","arXiv240500313v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Denoising diffusion models","powerful tools","image manipulation","interactive localized editing workflows","a novel training-free framework"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a novel training-free framework"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Layered Diffusion Brushes":3.0,"Image Editing":2.0,"LDB":2.0,"arXiv240500313v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Denoising diffusion models":1.0,"powerful tools":1.0,"image manipulation":1.0,"interactive localized editing workflows":1.0,"a novel training-free framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7629865425,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9104,"joy":0.0302,"surprise":0.0405,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0052,"anger":0.0072,"disgust":0.0036},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel image editing framework (LDB) that reduces processing time, achieving 140ms per edit.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_5289b7ebd411","title":"LineBreaker: Finding Token","content":"arXiv:2405.01668v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Token-inconsistency bugs (TIBs) involve the misuse of syntactically valid yet incorrect code tokens, such as misused variables and erroneous function invocations, which can often lead to software bugs. Unlike simple syntactic bugs, TIBs occur at the semantic level and are subtle - sometimes they remain undetected for years. Traditional detection methods, such as static analysis and dynamic testing, often struggle with TIBs due to their versatile and context-dependent nature. However, advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 present new opportunities for automating TIB detection by leveraging these models' semantic understanding capabilities. This paper reports the first systematic measurement of LLMs' capabilities in detecting TIBs, revealing that while GPT-4 shows promise, it exhibits limitations in precision and scalability. Specifically, its detection capability is undermined by the model's tendency to focus on the code snippets that do not contain TIBs; its scalability concern arises from GPT-4's high cost and the massive amount of code requiring inspection. To address these challenges, we introduce \\name, a novel and cascaded TIB detection system. \\name leverages smaller, code-specific, and highly efficient language models to filter out large numbers of code snippets unlikely to contain TIBs, thereby significantly enhancing the system's performance in terms of precision, recall, and scalability. We evaluated \\name on 154 Python and C GitHub repositories, each with over 1,000 stars, uncovering 123 new flaws, 45\\% of which could be exploited to disrupt program functionalities.

Existing approaches often assume known bidder value distributions and fixed sets of bidders and items, but these assumptions rarely hold in real-world settings where bidder values are unknown, and the number of future participants is uncertain. In this paper, we introduce the Conformal Online Auction Design (COAD), a novel mechanism that maximizes revenue by quantifying uncertainty in bidder values without relying on known distributions. COAD incorporates both bidder and item features, using historical data to design an incentive-compatible mechanism for online auctions. Unlike traditional methods, COAD leverages distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques and integrates machine learning methods, such as random forests, kernel methods, and deep neural networks, to predict bidder values while ensuring revenue guarantees. Moreover, COAD introduces bidder-specific reserve prices, based on the lower confidence bounds of bidder valuations, contrasting with the single reserve prices commonly used in the literature. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of COAD through an application to real-world eBay auction data. Theoretical results and extensive simulation studies further validate the properties of our approach.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07038","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.082387","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","csgt","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Jiale Han, Xiaowu Dai","raw_content_length":1442,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Conformal Online Auction Design"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1441,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Online Auction Design","Distribution","Announce Type","Online auction","a cornerstone","commerce","a key challenge","incentive-compatible mechanisms","expected revenue","Existing approaches"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Online Auction Design":2.0,"Distribution":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Online auction":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0,"commerce":1.0,"a key challenge":1.0,"incentive-compatible mechanisms":1.0,"expected revenue":1.0,"Existing approaches":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7630169374999998,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.339,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4678,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8007,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.0354,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.1235,"anger":0.0149,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel auction design (COAD) that aims to maximize revenue by quantifying uncertainty in bidder values.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the classical model for this task, frequently suffer from low consistency between image and text descriptions and insufficient richness in synthesized images. Recently, conditional affine transformations (CAT), such as conditional batch normalization and instance normalization, have been applied to different layers of GAN to control content synthesis in images. CAT is a multi-layer perceptron that independently predicts data based on batch statistics between neighboring layers, with global textual information unavailable to other layers. To address this issue, we first model CAT and a recurrent neural network (RAT) to ensure that different layers can access global information. We then introduce shuffle attention between RAT to mitigate the characteristic of information forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Moreover, both our generator and discriminator utilize the powerful pre-trained model, Clip, which has been extensively employed for establishing associations between text and images through the learning of multimodal representations in latent space. The discriminator utilizes CLIP's ability to comprehend complex scenes to accurately assess the quality of the generated images.

In this work, we present LDPKiT, a framework for non-adversarial, privacy-preserving model extraction that leverages a user's private in-distribution data while bounding privacy leakage. LDPKiT introduces a novel superimposition technique that generates approximately in-distribution samples, enabling effective knowledge transfer under local differential privacy (LDP). Experiments on Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and PathMNIST demonstrate that LDPKiT consistently improves utility while maintaining privacy, with benefits that become more pronounced at stronger noise levels. For example, on SVHN, LDPKiT achieves nearly the same inference accuracy at $\\epsilon=1.25$ as at $\\epsilon=2.0$, yielding stronger privacy guarantees with less than a 2% accuracy reduction. We further conduct sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of dataset size on performance and provide a systematic analysis of latent space representations, offering theoretical insights into the accuracy gains of LDPKiT.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16361","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.084881","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","cscy","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Kexin Li, Aastha Mehta, David Lie","raw_content_length":1339,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LDP"],"persons":["Machine Learning"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1338,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LDPKiT","Remote Queries","Privacy","arXiv240516361v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Users","modern Machine Learning ML cloud services","a privacy conundrum","one hand","concerns"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["modern Machine Learning ML cloud services"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LDPKiT":3.0,"Remote Queries":2.0,"Privacy":2.0,"arXiv240516361v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Users":1.0,"modern Machine Learning ML cloud services":1.0,"a privacy conundrum":1.0,"one hand":1.0,"concerns":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7631069880555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9141,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.009,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0353,"anger":0.0159,"disgust":0.0103},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel technique (LDPKiT) for privacy-preserving model extraction, demonstrating improved utility while maintaining privacy on benchmark datasets.

The best-known application is the assignment of parliamentary seats to political parties based on their share in the popular vote. Here we enrich the standard model of apportionment by associating each seat with a weight representing the (objective) value of that seat. A seat's weight reflects the fact that different seats might come with different roles, such as chair or treasurer. We define several apportionment methods and natural fairness requirements for this new setting, and we study the extent to which our methods satisfy these requirements. Our findings show that full fairness is harder to achieve than in the standard apportionment setting. Yet, for several natural relaxations of those requirements we can achieve stronger results than in the more expressive model of fair division with entitlements, where the values of objects are subjective.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18102","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.085257","language":"en","tags":["research","csgt","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Julian Chingoma, Ulle Endriss, Ronald de Haan, Adrian Haret, Jan Maly","raw_content_length":1084,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.82,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1083,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Apportionment","Weighted Seats","arXiv240518102v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the task","resources","entities","different entitlements","a fair manner","specifically a manner"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a fair manner"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Apportionment":3.0,"Weighted Seats":2.0,"arXiv240518102v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the task":1.0,"resources":1.0,"entities":1.0,"different entitlements":1.0,"a fair manner":1.0,"specifically a manner":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763121726111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.43,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.886,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9225,"joy":0.0251,"surprise":0.0341,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0012,"anger":0.0082,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores a new model for resource apportionment, which could potentially influence policy decisions related to resource allocation for sustainability initiatives.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a9a9f32bb6be","title":"SMC++: Masked Learning of Unsupervised Video Semantic Compression","content":"arXiv:2406.04765v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting semantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the compression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that particularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the semantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning generalizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also encode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost and bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the non-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The proposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression (SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several aspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading to better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a Transformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression efficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among heterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce a compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a similar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression module. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show remarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual quality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven datasets. \\textit{Codes and model are available at: https://github.com/tianyuan168326/VideoSemanticCompression-Pytorch.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04765","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.086521","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","csmm","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Yuan Tian, Xiaoyue Ling, Cong Geng, Qiang Hu, Guo Lu, Guangtao Zhai","raw_content_length":1834,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Semantic-Mining","SMC","Masked Learning of","Unsupervised Video Semantic Compression"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1833,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SMC","Masked Learning","Unsupervised Video Semantic Compression","arXiv240604765v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Most video compression methods","human visual perception","semantic preservation","severe semantic loss","the compression"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SMC":2.0,"Masked Learning":2.0,"Unsupervised Video Semantic Compression":2.0,"arXiv240604765v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Most video compression methods":1.0,"human visual perception":1.0,"semantic preservation":1.0,"severe semantic loss":1.0,"the compression":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763168168888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.1749999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.765,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7404,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0191,"sadness":0.0701,"fear":0.024,"anger":0.062,"disgust":0.0778},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel video compression method (SMC++) that aims to preserve semantic information, potentially reducing the computational resources and energy required for video analysis tasks.

Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand.

To address this limitation, we present LML-IQA, an innovative no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) approach that leverages a combination of local manifold learning and contrastive learning. Our approach first extracts multiple patches from each image and identifies the most visually salient region. This salient patch serves as a positive sample for contrastive learning, while other patches from the same image are treated as intra-class negatives to preserve local distinctiveness.

However, existing quantization toolkits often lack transparency, flexibility, and system-level scalability across GPUs and distributed environments. We present \\textbf{LLMEasyQuant}, a modular, system-aware quantization framework designed for efficient, low-bit inference of LLMs on single-node multi-GPU, multi-node, and edge hardware. LLMEasyQuant supports a wide range of quantization methods -- including Symmetric Quantization, ZeroQuant, SmoothQuant, and SimQuant -- with unified interfaces for per-layer calibration, bitwidth assignment, and runtime adaptation. It integrates fused CUDA kernels with NCCL-based distributed synchronization and supports both static and online quantization. Empirical results show that LLMEasyQuant can achieve substantial speedup in GEMM execution, HBM load time, and near-linear multi-GPU scaling. Ablation studies further validate its ability to balance latency, memory, and accuracy under diverse deployment conditions.

The focus of this paper is on computing these two parameters for graphs embedded on the plane with crossings. For planar graphs -- which can be embedded on the plane without any crossings -- it has long been known that vertex and edge connectivity can be computed in linear time. Recently, the algorithm for vertex connectivity was extended from planar graphs to 1-plane graphs (where each edge is crossed at most once) without $\\times$-crossings -- these are crossings whose endpoints induce a matching. The key insight, for both these classes of graphs, is that any two vertices/edges of a minimum vertex/edge cut have small face-distance (distance measured by number of faces) in the embedding. In this paper, we attempt at a comprehensive generalization of this idea to a wider class of graphs embedded on the plane. Our method works for all those embedded graphs where every pair of crossing edges is connected by a path whose vertices and edges have a small face-distance from the crossing point. Important examples of such graphs include optimal 2-planar and optimal 3-planar graphs, $d$-map graphs, $d$-framed graphs, graphs with bounded crossing number, and $k$-plane graphs with bounded number of $\\times$-crossings. For all these graph classes, we get a linear-time algorithm for computing vertex and edge connectivity.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00586","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.088126","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csds","mathco","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Therese Biedl, Prosenjit Bose, Karthik Murali","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Crossings arXiv:2407.00586v2"],"persons":["Computing Vertex"],"locations":["planar"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1546,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Computing Vertex","Edge Connectivity","Graphs","Crossings","edge connectivity","the plane","Announce Type","Abstract","Vertex connectivity","fundamental concepts"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Computing Vertex":2.0,"Edge Connectivity":2.0,"Graphs":2.0,"Crossings":2.0,"edge connectivity":2.0,"the plane":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Vertex connectivity":1.0,"fundamental concepts":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763230159722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8857,"joy":0.0237,"surprise":0.057,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.011,"anger":0.011,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical algorithm for improving the efficiency of computing vertex and edge connectivity in certain classes of graphs.

This paper focuses on the new family of capacity-achieving codes, Spinal codes, to provide a comprehensive analysis framework to tightly upper bound the block error rate (BLER) of Spinal codes in the finite block length (FBL) regime. First, we resort to a variant of the Gallager random coding bound to upper bound the BLER of Spinal codes over the fading channel. Then, this paper derives a new bound without resorting to the use of Gallager random coding bound, achieving provable tightness over the wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The derived BLER upper bounds in this paper are generalized, facilitating the performance evaluations of Spinal codes over different types of fast fading channels. Over the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Rician fading channels, this paper explicitly derived the BLER upper bounds on Spinal codes as case studies. Based on the bounds, we theoretically reveal that the tail transmission pattern (TTP) for ML-decoded Spinal codes remains optimal in terms of reliability performance. Simulations verify the tightness of the bounds and the insights obtained.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03741","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.088929","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","mathit","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Aimin Li, Xiaomeng Chen, Shaohua Wu, Gary C.

Unlike functionality issues, performance issues are more difficult to diagnose and resolve due to their complex root causes, which often emerge only under specific conditions or payloads. Although many efforts haven attempt to mitigate the impact of performance issues by developing methods to automatically identify and resolve them, it remains unclear if this objective has been fulfilled, and the existing approaches indeed targeted on the most critical performance issues encountered in real-world settings. To this end, we conducted a large-scale comparative study of Android performance issues in real-world applications and literature. Specifically, we started by investigating real-world performance issues, their underlying root causes (i.e., contributing factors), and common code patterns. We then took an additional step to empirically summarize existing approaches and datasets through a literature review, assessing how well academic research reflects the real-world challenges faced by developers and users. Our comparison results show a substantial divergence exists in the primary performance concerns of researchers, developers, and users. Among all the identified factors, 57.14% have not been examined in academic research, while a substantial 76.39% remain unaddressed by existing tools, and 66.67% lack corresponding datasets.

This work addresses the prevalence and lack of adequate software mitigations for uninitialized memory issues, proposing architectural protections in hardware. Capability-based addressing, such as the University of Cambridge's CHERI, mitigates many memory defects, including spatial and temporal safety violations at an architectural level. CHERI, however, does not handle undefined behavior from uninitialized variables. We extend the CHERI capability model to include \"conditional capabilities\", enabling memory-access policies based on prior operations.

Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09073","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.090137","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Rohit Gupta, Mamshad Nayeem Rizve, Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Ashish Tawari, Son Tran, Mubarak Shah, Benjamin Yao, Trishul Chilimbi","raw_content_length":1459,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","VLM","CLIP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1458,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Open Vocabulary Multi","VLMs","Announce Type","Pre-trained vision-language models","significant progress","open vocabulary computer vision tasks","image classification","object detection","image segmentation","Some recent works"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Pre-trained vision-language models","open vocabulary computer vision tasks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Open Vocabulary Multi":2.0,"VLMs":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Pre-trained vision-language models":1.0,"significant progress":1.0,"open vocabulary computer vision tasks":1.0,"image classification":1.0,"object detection":1.0,"image segmentation":1.0,"Some recent works":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763306143055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2955,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8591,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8773,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0642,"sadness":0.0251,"fear":0.0074,"anger":0.0093,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for open vocabulary multilabel video classification using VLMs and LLMs. While the research is promising, it is still in the applied research phase with no concrete deployments or measurable outcomes related to sustainability.

In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.090566","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","preprints","research","q-bionc","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Zafeirios Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang","raw_content_length":1831,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EM-LLM"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["Bayesian"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1830,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Human","arXiv240709450v3","Announce Type","Abstract","Large language models","LLMs","remarkable capabilities","processing","extensive contexts","their ability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models","processing"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Human":2.0,"arXiv240709450v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"remarkable capabilities":1.0,"processing":1.0,"extensive contexts":1.0,"their ability":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7633206538888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.1355,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8271,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7992,"joy":0.0223,"surprise":0.1402,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0126,"anger":0.0123,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel approach (EM-LLM) to improve LLM's ability to handle long contexts, potentially reducing the computational resources needed for AI tasks.

We consider a number of reasonable weakenings of the SETH, with sources from (i) circuit complexity (ii) backdoors for SAT-solving (iii) graph width parameters and (iv) weighted satisfiability problems. Our goal is to arrive at formulations which are simultaneously more plausible as hypotheses, but also capture interesting and robust notions of complexity. Using several tools from classical complexity theory we are able to consolidate these numerous hypotheses into a hierarchy of five main equivalence classes of increasing solidity. This framework serves as a step towards structurally classifying a variety of SETH-based lower bounds into intermediate equivalence classes. To illustrate the applicability of our framework, for each of our classes we give at least one (non-SAT) problem which is equivalent to the class as a characteristic example application. As our main showcase, we consider a natural parameterization of Independent Set by vertex deletion distance from several standard graph classes. We provide precise characterizations of the difficulty of breaking such bounds, in particular proving that obtaining $(2-\\varepsilon)^kn^{O(1)}$ time algorithms for Cograph$+kv$ or Block$+kv$ graphs is equivalent to obtaining a fast satisfiability algorithm for circuits of depth $\\varepsilon n$; while solving the weighted version for Interval$+kv$ graphs is equivalent to the (seemingly) harder problem of obtaining a fast satisfiability algorithm for SAT parameterized by a 2-SAT backdoor.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09683","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.090971","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Michael Lampis","raw_content_length":1718,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SETH","Backdoors","The Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis","SAT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1715,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the SETH","Circuits","Backdoors","Five Shades","arXiv240709683v2","Announce Type","Abstract","The Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis","SETH","a standard assumption"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the SETH":3.0,"Circuits":2.0,"Backdoors":2.0,"Five Shades":2.0,"arXiv240709683v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis":1.0,"SETH":1.0,"a standard assumption":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763336284166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9282,"joy":0.023,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.0041,"fear":0.0058,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical computer science research exploring the complexity of solving satisfiability problems.

In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving.

Continuum idealizations of large-scale swarms are used where the dynamics describe the evolution of the spatially-distributed densities of each agent class. The problem formulation we adopt is motivated by applications where agents of one class are assigned to agents of the other class, which we refer to as demand and resource agents respectively. Assignments have costs related to the distances between mutually assigned agents, and the overall cost of an assignment is quantified by a Wasserstein distance between the densities of the two agent classes. When agents can move, the assignment cost can decrease at the expense of a physical motion cost, and this tradeoff sets up a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimal control problem. We show that in one spatial dimension, this problem can be converted to an infinite-dimensional, but decoupled, linear-quadratic (LQ) tracking problem when expressed in terms of the quantile functions of the respective agent densities. Solutions are given in the general one-dimensional case, as well as in the special cases of constant and periodically time-varying demands.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18159","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.093322","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","mathoc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Max Emerick, Stacy Patterson, Bassam Bamieh","raw_content_length":1261,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Optimal Assignment"],"persons":["Wasserstein"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1260,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["agents","Optimal Assignment","Motion Control","arXiv240718159v2 Announce Type","Abstract","optimal swarm control problems","two different classes","Continuum idealizations","large-scale swarms","the dynamics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"agents":3.0,"Optimal Assignment":2.0,"Motion Control":2.0,"arXiv240718159v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"optimal swarm control problems":1.0,"two different classes":1.0,"Continuum idealizations":1.0,"large-scale swarms":1.0,"the dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763428885277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8403,"joy":0.0119,"surprise":0.0246,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0435,"anger":0.0474,"disgust":0.0253},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores a theoretical framework for optimal swarm control, focusing on assignment costs and motion costs.

In this work, we discover that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. To address this issue, we rebalance the computational load from data, model, and memory perspectives, achieving more balanced computation across devices. Specifically, for the data, instances are grouped into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. A search-based method is employed for the model to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjust the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. These three perspectives are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, training time is reduced greatly, achieving about 1.8$\\times$ speed-up.

Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21022","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.094532","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Junjie Huang, Jizheng Chen, Jianghao Lin, Jiarui Qin, Ziming Feng, Weinan Zhang, Yong Yu","raw_content_length":1483,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Recommender Systems arXiv:2407.21022v2"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1482,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Comprehensive Survey","Retrieval Methods","Recommender Systems","arXiv240721022v2","Announce Type","Abstract","an era","information overload","effective recommender systems","the deluge"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Comprehensive Survey":2.0,"Retrieval Methods":2.0,"Recommender Systems":2.0,"arXiv240721022v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"an era":1.0,"information overload":1.0,"effective recommender systems":1.0,"the deluge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763471366111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8336,"joy":0.0177,"surprise":0.1036,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0136,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of recommender systems, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption by optimizing resource allocation.

Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace identification to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with stochastic uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The first and second moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainty. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02777","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.095313","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","mathoc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Joshua Pilipovsky, Panagiotis Tsiotras","raw_content_length":1696,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["noisy data","DUST","LTI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1695,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DUST","A Framework","Data","the problem","arXiv240802777v2 Announce Type","Abstract","data-driven stochastic optimal control","an unknown LTI dynamical system","the process noise","the states mean"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DUST":2.0,"A Framework":2.0,"Data":2.0,"the problem":2.0,"arXiv240802777v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"data-driven stochastic optimal control":1.0,"an unknown LTI dynamical system":1.0,"the process noise":1.0,"the states mean":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763502446111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8155,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6369,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7527,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0351,"sadness":0.0091,"fear":0.1488,"anger":0.0254,"disgust":0.0191},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework (DUST) for data-driven stochastic optimal control, focusing on uncertainty quantification and density steering in LTI dynamical systems.

It is among the most crucial parameters to give real-world effectiveness. Organizations that achieve interoperability will be able to identify, prevent, and provide appropriate protection on an international scale, which can be relied upon. This paper aims to explain how future technologies such as 6G mobile communication, Internet of Everything (IoE), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Smart Contract embedded WPA3 protocol-based WiFi-8 can work together to prevent known attack vectors and provide protection against zero-day attacks, thus offering intelligent solutions for smart cities. The phrase zero-day refers to an attack that occurs on the day zero of the vulnerability's disclosure to the public or vendor. Existing systems require an extra layer of security. In the security world, interoperability enables disparate security solutions and systems to collaborate seamlessly. AI improves cybersecurity by enabling improved capabilities for detecting, responding, and preventing zero-day attacks. When interoperability and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are integrated into cybersecurity, they form a strong protection against zero-day assaults.

The conventional IB method, while effective for fluid-structure interaction applications, has long been challenged by poor volume conservation, particularly evident in simulations of pressurized, closed membranes. We demonstrate that composite B-spline regularized delta functions significantly enhance volume conservation through two complementary properties: they provide continuously divergence-free velocity interpolants and maintain the gradient character of forces corresponding to mean pressure jumps across interfaces. By correctly representing these forces as discrete gradients, they eliminate a key source of spurious flows that typically plague immersed boundary computations. Our approach maintains the local nature of the classical IB method, avoiding the computational overhead associated with the non-local Divergence-Free Immersed Boundary (DFIB) method's construction of an explicit velocity potential which requires additional Poisson solves for interpolation and force spreading operations. We show that sufficiently regular composite B-spline kernels maintain initial volumes to within machine precision. We provide a detailed analysis of the relationship between kernel regularity and the accuracy of force spreading and velocity interpolation operations. Our findings indicate that composite B-splines of at least $C^1$ regularity produce results comparable to the DFIB method in dynamic simulations, with errors in volume conservation dominated by truncation error of the time-stepping scheme. The proposed approach requires minimal modifications to an existing IB code, making it an accessible improvement for a wide range of applications in computational fluid dynamics and fluid-structure interaction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08280","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.096147","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicscomp-ph","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Cole Gruninger, Boyce E.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f2300b3103b8","title":"MVIGER: Multi","content":"arXiv:2408.08686v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have been widely used in recommender systems to incorporate textual information of items into item IDs, leveraging their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recently, generative recommender systems have utilized the reasoning abilities of LMs to directly generate index tokens for potential items of interest based on the user's interaction history. To inject diverse item knowledge into LMs, prompt templates with detailed task descriptions and various indexing techniques derived from diverse item information have been explored. This paper focuses on the inconsistency in outputs generated by variations in input prompt templates and item index types, even with the same user's interaction history. Our in-depth quantitative analysis reveals that preference knowledge learned from diverse prompt templates and heterogeneous indices differs significantly, indicating a high potential for complementarity. To fully exploit this complementarity and provide consistent performance under varying prompts and item indices, we propose MVIGER, a unified variational framework that models selection among these information sources as a categorical latent variable with a learnable prior. During inference, this prior enables the model to adaptively select the most relevant source or aggregate predictions across multiple sources, thereby ensuring high-quality recommendation across diverse template-index combinations. We validate the effectiveness of MVIGER on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing generative recommender baselines through the effective integration of complementary knowledge.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08686","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.096590","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csir","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Tongyoung Kim, Soojin Yoon, Seongku Kang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee","raw_content_length":1731,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MVIGER","Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1730,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LMs","MVIGER","Multi","arXiv240808686v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Language Models","recommender systems","textual information","items","item IDs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LMs":3.0,"MVIGER":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv240808686v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Language Models":1.0,"recommender systems":1.0,"textual information":1.0,"items":1.0,"item IDs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7635460241666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8914,"joy":0.0265,"surprise":0.0675,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.0068,"disgust":0.0022},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework (MVIGER) for improving the consistency and performance of generative recommender systems.

However, the issue of long context in complex tasks poses a significant barrier to their wider adoption, manifested in two main aspects: (i) The excessively long context leads to high costs and inference delays. (ii) A substantial amount of task-irrelevant information introduced by long contexts exacerbates the \"lost in the middle\" problem. Existing methods compress context by removing redundant tokens using metrics such as self-information or PPL, which is inconsistent with the objective of retaining the most important tokens when conditioning on a given query. In this study, we introduce information bottleneck theory (IB) to model the problem, offering a novel perspective that thoroughly addresses the essential properties required for context compression. Additionally, we propose a cross-attention-based approach to approximate mutual information in IB, which can be flexibly replaced with suitable alternatives in different scenarios. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 25% increase in compression rate compared to the state-of-the-art, while maintaining question answering performance. In particular, the context compressed by our method even outperform the full context in some cases.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10497","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.097406","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Yihang Wang, Xu Huang, Bowen Tian, Yueyang Su, Lei Yu, Huaming Liao, Yixing Fan, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","raw_content_length":1439,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PPL","QUITO arXiv:2408.10497v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1438,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["QUITO","arXiv240810497v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Generative LLM","remarkable success","various industrial applications","their promising In-Context Learning capabilities","the issue","long context","complex tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Generative LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"QUITO":2.0,"arXiv240810497v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Generative LLM":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"various industrial applications":1.0,"their promising In-Context Learning capabilities":1.0,"the issue":1.0,"long context":1.0,"complex tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763574893888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.511000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9022,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5971,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0156,"sadness":0.0654,"fear":0.0392,"anger":0.2157,"disgust":0.0575},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to compress the context used by generative LLMs, which could lead to reduced energy consumption and faster inference.
