However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion, while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent improvement.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a01f07532ec3","title":"An Improved Model","content":"arXiv:2510.08882v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work (Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting. We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025). We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$ (off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from $T^{2/3}$ to $\\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08882","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.617904","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Haolin Liu, Chen-Yu Wei, Julian Zimmert","raw_content_length":1899,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DEC"],"persons":["Dig-DEC","Foster et al."],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1894,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["An Improved Model","DMSO","the size","arXiv251008882v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","structured observation","Previous work","Foster","the complexity","the decision-estimation coefficient"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"An Improved Model":2.0,"DMSO":2.0,"the size":2.0,"arXiv251008882v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"structured observation":1.0,"Previous work":1.0,"Foster":1.0,"the complexity":1.0,"the decision-estimation coefficient":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762474021944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.194,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9307,"joy":0.009,"surprise":0.0345,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0034,"anger":0.011,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents an improved model for decision-making in adversarial environments, leading to improved regret bounds in hybrid MDPs.

Motivated by problems in network monitoring and resource allocation, we consider the submodular cover problem in an online setting. As a concrete example, suppose at each time $t$, a nonnegative monotone submodular function $g_t$ is given to us. We define $f^{(t)} = \\sum_{s \\leq t} g_s$ as the sum of all functions seen so far. We need to maintain a submodular cover of these submodular functions $f^{(1)}, f^{(2)}, \\ldots f^{(T)}$ in an online fashion; i.e., we cannot revoke previous choices. Formally, at each time $t$ we produce a set $S_t \\subseteq N$ such that $f^{(t)}(S_t) = f^{(t)}(N)$ -- i.e., this set $S_t$ is a cover -- such that $S_{t-1} \\subseteq S_t$, so previously decisions to pick elements cannot be revoked. (We actually allow more general sequences $\\{f^{(t)}\\}$ of submodular functions, but this sum-of-simpler-submodular-functions case is useful for concreteness.) We give polylogarithmic competitive algorithms for this online submodular cover problem. The competitive ratio on an input sequence of length $T$ is $O(\\ln n \\ln (T \\cdot f(N) / f_{\\text{min}}))$, where $f_{\\text{min}}$ is the smallest nonzero marginal for functions $f^{(t)}$, and $|N| = n$. For the special case of online set cover, our competitive ratio matches that of Alon et al. [SIAM J. Comp. 03], which are best possible for polynomial-time online algorithms unless $NP \\subseteq BPP$ (see Korman 04). Since existing offline algorithms for submodular cover are based on greedy approaches which seem difficult to implement online, the technical challenge is to (approximately) solve the exponential-sized linear programming relaxation for submodular cover, and to round it, both in the online setting.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08883","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.618364","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csds","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":292,"author":"Anupam Gupta, Roie Levin","raw_content_length":1896,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.46,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["f(S","g_t$","Announce Type"],"locations":["f^{(2"],"monetary":["f^{(t","S_{t-1","f^{(t)}(S_t"]},"char_count":1893,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Online Submodular Cover Problem","the submodular cover problem","arXiv251008883v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a monotone submodular function","cost","problems","network monitoring and resource allocation","an online setting","a concrete example"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Online Submodular Cover Problem":2.0,"the submodular cover problem":2.0,"arXiv251008883v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a monotone submodular function":1.0,"cost":1.0,"problems":1.0,"network monitoring and resource allocation":1.0,"an online setting":1.0,"a concrete example":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7624927280555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2105,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7579,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8621,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0524,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0256,"anger":0.0321,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents an algorithm for solving the online submodular cover problem, motivated by network monitoring and resource allocation.

To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort.

I examine the guidance of student researchers in computing (abbreviated to research guidance or guidance throughout) within a facet framework, creating an inventory of roles that faculty members can hold. By expanding and disambiguating the language of guidance, this approach reveals the full breadth of faculty responsibilities toward student researchers, and it facilitates discussing conflicts between those responsibilities. Additionally, the facet framework permits greater flexibility for students seeking guidance, allowing them a robust support network without implying inadequacy in an individual faculty member's skills. I further argue that an over-reliance on singular terms like advising or mentoring for the guidance of student researchers obscures the full scope of faculty responsibilities and interferes with improvement of those as skills.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured, interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings, FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning. We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval, classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy, structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_49de44d2b0d1","title":"Observation Matrix Design for Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation via 2D Ice Filling","content":"arXiv:2510.08887v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In recent years, densifying multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has attracted much attention from the communication community. Thanks to the subwavelength antenna spacing, the strong correlations among densifying antennas provide sufficient prior knowledge about channel state information (CSI). This inspires the careful design of observation matrices (e.g., transmit precoders and receive combiners), that exploits the CSI prior knowledge, to boost channel estimation performance. Aligned with this vision, this work proposes to jointly design the combiners and precoders by maximizing the mutual information between the received pilots and densifying MIMO channels. A two-dimensional ice-filling (2DIF) algorithm is proposed to efficiently accomplish this objective. The algorithm is motivated by the fact that the eigenspace of MIMO channel covariance can be decoupled into two sub-eigenspaces, which are associated with the correlations of transmitter antennas and receiver antennas, respectively. By properly setting the precoder and the combiner as the eigenvectors from these two sub-eigenspaces, the 2DIF promises to generate near-optimal observation matrices. Moreover, we further extend the 2DIF method to the popular hybrid combining systems, where a two-stage 2DIF (TS-2DIF) algorithm is developed to handle the analog combining circuits realized by phase shifters. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed 2DIF and TS-2DIF methods can achieve superior channel estimation accuracy.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08887","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.620072","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","mathit","preprints","eesssy","eesssp","cssy","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Zijian Zhang, Mingyao Cui","raw_content_length":1596,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["antennas","CSI"],"persons":["MIMO"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1595,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Observation Matrix Design","Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation","2D Ice Filling","arXiv251008887v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","recent years","multiple-input multiple-output MIMO","much attention","the communication community","the subwavelength antenna spacing"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Observation Matrix Design":2.0,"Densifying MIMO Channel Estimation":2.0,"2D Ice Filling":2.0,"arXiv251008887v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"recent years":1.0,"multiple-input multiple-output MIMO":1.0,"much attention":1.0,"the communication community":1.0,"the subwavelength antenna spacing":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7625548969444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.591000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.819,"joy":0.0757,"surprise":0.0569,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0133,"anger":0.0218,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new algorithm (2DIF) for improving channel estimation in MIMO systems, which could potentially lead to more efficient wireless communication.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ee4337df4b5b","title":"Typestate via Revocable Capabilities","content":"arXiv:2510.08889v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Managing stateful resources safely and expressively is a longstanding challenge in programming languages, especially in the presence of aliasing. While scope-based constructs such as Java's synchronized blocks offer ease of reasoning, they restrict expressiveness and parallelism. Conversely, imperative, flow-sensitive management enables fine-grained control but demands sophisticated typestate analyses and often burdens programmers with explicit state tracking. In this work, we present a novel approach that unifies the strengths of both paradigms by extending flow-insensitive capability mechanisms into flow-sensitive typestate tracking. Our system decouples capability lifetimes from lexical scopes, allowing functions to provide, revoke, and return capabilities in a flow-sensitive manner, based on the existing mechanisms explored for the safety and ergonomics of scoped capability programming. We implement our approach as an extension to the Scala 3 compiler, leveraging path-dependent types and implicit resolution to enable concise, statically safe, and expressive typestate programming. Our prototype generically supports a wide range of stateful patterns, including file operations, advanced locking protocols, DOM construction, and session types. This work demonstrates that expressive and safe typestate management can be achieved with minimal extensions to existing capability-based languages, paving the way for more robust and ergonomic stateful programming.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08889","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.620894","language":"en","tags":["cspl","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Songlin Jia, Craig Liu, Siyuan He, Haotian Deng, Yuyan Bao, Tiark Rompf","raw_content_length":1531,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Revocable"],"persons":["Java"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1526,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Revocable Capabilities","arXiv251008889v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","stateful resources","a longstanding challenge","programming languages","the presence","aliasing","scope-based constructs","Javas synchronized blocks"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["programming languages"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Revocable Capabilities":2.0,"arXiv251008889v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"stateful resources":1.0,"a longstanding challenge":1.0,"programming languages":1.0,"the presence":1.0,"aliasing":1.0,"scope-based constructs":1.0,"Javas synchronized blocks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7625867686111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9351,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0176,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0101,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to typestate management in programming languages, implemented as an extension to the Scala 3 compiler.

To address these challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine, and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context, and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements.

This paper addresses the problem of producing a virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters, thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and highlighting the potential of our method.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09475","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.757429","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Ruben Pascual, Mikel Sesma-Sara, Aranzazu Jurio, Daniel Paternain, Mikel Galar","raw_content_length":1615,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DreamBooth","LoRA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1614,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Few-shot multi","arXiv251009475v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The audiovisual industry","a profound transformation","AI developments","routine tasks","new forms","art","This paper"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI developments","art"],"engineering":["AI developments"],"business_innovation":["art"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Few-shot multi":2.0,"arXiv251009475v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The audiovisual industry":1.0,"a profound transformation":1.0,"AI developments":1.0,"routine tasks":1.0,"new forms":1.0,"art":1.0,"This paper":1.0}},"age_hours":2.767572748888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5805,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9161,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7428,"joy":0.0719,"surprise":0.0296,"sadness":0.008,"fear":0.0901,"anger":0.0393,"disgust":0.0183},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI method for generating characters, but its direct impact on sustainability is minimal.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_556aba52430f","title":"Modeling Time","content":"arXiv:2510.08901v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield, and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually, requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide application, yield, and rot.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f4aeb8422f33","title":"Autoencoding","content":"arXiv:2510.08907v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08907","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.624240","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Xin Liu, RunSong Zhao, PengCheng Huang, XinYu Liu, JunYi Xiao, ChunYang Xiao, Tong Xiao, Shengxiang Gao, Zhengtao Yu, JingBo Zhu","raw_content_length":1843,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Semantic-Anchor Compression","Autoencoding arXiv:2510.08907v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","SAC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1842,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["autoencoding tasks","arXiv251008907v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Context compression","a promising approach","large language model LLM inference","compact representations","Current context compression methods","tasks","context-agnostic compression tokens"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language model LLM inference"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"autoencoding tasks":2.0,"arXiv251008907v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Context compression":1.0,"a promising approach":1.0,"large language model LLM inference":1.0,"compact representations":1.0,"Current context compression methods":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"context-agnostic compression tokens":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762708303888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7974,"joy":0.0118,"surprise":0.0216,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.078,"anger":0.0471,"disgust":0.0374},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (SAC) for compressing large language model contexts, potentially reducing energy consumption during inference.

Although algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08908","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.624683","language":"en","tags":["statml","research","csai","mathit","preprints","cslg","csit","computer-science","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Di Zhang","raw_content_length":1516,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Upper Confidence Bound","Thompson Sampling","Frequency-Domain Analysis","the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem:","MAB"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1515,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Frequency-Domain Analysis","the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem","A New Perspective","the Exploration","arXiv251008908v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The stochastic multi-armed bandit MAB problem","the most fundamental models","sequential decision-making","the core challenge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A Frequency-Domain Analysis"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Frequency-Domain Analysis":2.0,"the Multi-Armed Bandit Problem":2.0,"A New Perspective":2.0,"the Exploration":2.0,"arXiv251008908v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The stochastic multi-armed bandit MAB problem":1.0,"the most fundamental models":1.0,"sequential decision-making":1.0,"the core challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7627246925,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.729,"joy":0.0118,"surprise":0.0275,"sadness":0.0096,"fear":0.1517,"anger":0.0461,"disgust":0.0242},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing multi-armed bandit problems, which could potentially lead to more efficient algorithms for resource allocation in various fields, including energy management and smart grids.

However, state-of-the-art kernel fuzzers, including the de facto standard Syzkaller, struggle to generate valid syscall sequences that respect implicit Syscall Dependency Relations (SDRs). Consequently, many generated seeds either fail kernel validation or cannot penetrate deep execution paths, resulting in significant inefficiency. We hypothesize that SDRs can be effectively learned from both historic and present kernel execution data, and that incorporating these learned relations into fuzzing can substantially improve seed validity and diversity. To validate this, we propose an approach that utilizes the N-gram model to mine SDRs from the Dongting dataset-one of the largest Linux kernel execution datasets available-as well as from execution traces collected on the fly during fuzzing. The resulting model is used to continuously augment the Choice Table of Syzkaller to improve its seed generation and demonstrably increases the Shannon Entropy of the Choice Table throughout fuzzing, reflecting more empirically-grounded choices in expanding syscall sequences into valid and diverse seeds. In addition, we introduce a Random Walk strategy that instructs Syzkaller to construct seeds in a bidirectional manner to further diversify the generated seeds. We implement our approach in a prototype, Psyzkaller, built on top of Syzkaller. Experiments on three representative Linux kernel versions show that Psyzkaller improves Syzkaller's code coverage by 4.6%-7.0% in 48-hour fuzzing, while triggering 110.4%-187.2% more crashes.

However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family (e.g., dog $\\preceq$ mammal $\\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across different concept families (e.g., \"a dog in a car\" $\\preceq$ dog, car). Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08919","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.627562","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Daiki Yoshikawa, Takashi Matsubara","raw_content_length":1269,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["PHyCLIP"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\ell_1$","$\\ell_1$-Product metric","$\\ell_1$-product metric"]},"char_count":1268,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ell_1","arXiv251008919v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Vision-language models","remarkable success","multi-modal representation learning","large-scale pairs","visual scenes","linguistic descriptions","two distinct types"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large-scale pairs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ell_1":2.0,"arXiv251008919v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Vision-language models":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"multi-modal representation learning":1.0,"large-scale pairs":1.0,"visual scenes":1.0,"linguistic descriptions":1.0,"two distinct types":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762834141111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7937,"joy":0.0241,"surprise":0.1543,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.0058,"anger":0.0107,"disgust":0.0038},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to vision-language models, but it is currently in the basic research stage.

Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale. However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting. The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger robustness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08920","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.627945","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":151,"author":"Yuting Yang, Gang Mei, Zhengjing Ma, Nengxiong Xu, Jianbing Peng","raw_content_length":1206,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.755,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Earth"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1205,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Simple and Robust Forecasting","Spatiotemporally Correlated Small Earth Data","A Tabular Foundation Model","arXiv251008920v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Small Earth data","geoscience observations","limited short-term monitoring variability","sparse but meaningful measurements","spatiotemporal correlations"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Spatiotemporally Correlated Small Earth Data","spatiotemporal correlations"],"research_academic":["geoscience observations"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Simple and Robust Forecasting":2.0,"Spatiotemporally Correlated Small Earth Data":2.0,"A Tabular Foundation Model":2.0,"arXiv251008920v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Small Earth data":1.0,"geoscience observations":1.0,"limited short-term monitoring variability":1.0,"sparse but meaningful measurements":1.0,"spatiotemporal correlations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7628478419444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4939,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8973,"joy":0.0101,"surprise":0.0287,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0323,"anger":0.0173,"disgust":0.0068},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach for forecasting spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data using tabular foundation models.

Existing land use datasets suffer from coarse granularity and difficulty in capturing intra-block heterogeneity. To this end, we present the Greater Bay Area Urban Building Function Dataset (GBA-UBF), a large-scale, fine-grained dataset that assigns one of five functional categories to nearly four million buildings across six core GBA cities. We proposed a Multi-level Building Function Optimization (ML-BFO) method by integrating Points of Interest (POI) records and building footprints through a three-stage pipeline: (1) candidate label generation using spatial overlay with proximity weighting, (2) iterative refinement based on neighborhood label autocorrelation, and (3) function-related correction informed by High-level POI buffers. To quantitatively validate results, we design the Building Function Matching Index (BFMI), which jointly measures categorical consistency and distributional similarity against POI-derived probability heatmaps. Comparative experiments demonstrate that GBA-UBF achieves significantly higher accuracy, with a BMFI of 0.58. This value markedly exceeds that of the baseline dataset and exhibits superior alignment with urban activity patterns. Field validation further confirms the dataset's semantic reliability and practical interpretability. The GBA-UBF dataset establishes a reproducible framework for building-level functional classification, bridging the gap between coarse land use maps and fine-grained urban analytics.

While some researchers have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without introducing additional computational overhead.

Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static domain decomposition approaches.

While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.629619","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Han Hu, Zhuoran Zheng, Chen Lyu","raw_content_length":1566,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SVD","Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1565,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Defense","Unauthorized Distillation","Image Restoration","Feature Space Perturbation","arXiv251008925v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a significant threat","deep model intellectual property","adversaries","student networks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Defense":2.0,"Unauthorized Distillation":2.0,"Image Restoration":2.0,"Feature Space Perturbation":2.0,"arXiv251008925v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a significant threat":1.0,"deep model intellectual property":1.0,"adversaries":1.0,"student networks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762909930833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.643,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0193,"sadness":0.0244,"fear":0.1875,"anger":0.0691,"disgust":0.0498},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel defense mechanism against knowledge distillation attacks in image restoration models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_4e11625948b6","title":"MATT-CTR: Unleashing a Model-Agnostic Test","content":"arXiv:2510.08932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths, thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations, we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08932","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.631177","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Moyu Zhang, Yun Chen, Yujun Jin, Jinxin Hu, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CTR","MATT-CTR","MATT","Model-Agnostic Test-Time"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1546,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a Model-Agnostic Test","Announce Type","new Abstract","a growing body","research","CTR model","better model feature interactions","training objectives","parameter learning","better predictive performance"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["research"],"research_academic":["research"],"ai_ml":["training objectives"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a Model-Agnostic Test":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a growing body":1.0,"research":1.0,"CTR model":1.0,"better model feature interactions":1.0,"training objectives":1.0,"parameter learning":1.0,"better predictive performance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7629694861111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.7255,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9451,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8797,"joy":0.0133,"surprise":0.0189,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.0412,"anger":0.0276,"disgust":0.0136},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel method (MATT) to improve the inference phase of CTR models, potentially leading to more efficient resource utilization in online advertising.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_52a40196b699","title":"Personalize Before Retrieve: LLM","content":"arXiv:2510.08935v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice, identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users. This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges, we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG systems.

While it has been widely explored over the past 25 years, many common assumptions are not aligned with the realities of 5G networks. In this paper, we consider the CR problem for the following setup: (i) infrastructure-based systems, where downlink transmissions might occur to receivers whose positions are not, or not exactly, known; (ii) multi-beam antennas at both primary and secondary base stations. We formulate a detailed protocol to determine when secondary transmissions into different beam directions can interfere with primary users at potential locations and create probability-based interference rules. We then analyze the \"catastrophic interference\" probability and the \"missed transmission opportunity\" probability, as well as the achievable throughput, as a function of the transmit powers of the primary and secondary base stations and the sensing window of the secondary base station. Results can serve to more realistically assess the spectral efficiency gains in 5G infrastructure-based cognitive systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08937","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.632413","language":"en","tags":["research","mathit","preprints","eesssy","cssy","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Omer Gokalp Serbetci, Lei Chu, Andreas F.

Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures; (ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts.

We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring, experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static, dynamic, and recurrent baselines.

Companies often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1) extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations, and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment, and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns. Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results. Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08948","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.635475","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","csai","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Nan Lu, Yurong Hu, Jiaquan Fang, Yan Liu, Rui Dong, Yiming Wang, Rui Lin, Shaoyi Xu","raw_content_length":1783,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1778,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SHERLOCK","Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation","LLM","arXiv251008948v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The growth","the e-commerce industry","the adversarial dynamics","shadow economy actors","risk management teams"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SHERLOCK":2.0,"Dynamic Knowledge Adaptation":2.0,"LLM":2.0,"arXiv251008948v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The growth":1.0,"the e-commerce industry":1.0,"the adversarial dynamics":1.0,"shadow economy actors":1.0,"risk management teams":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763124971111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":0.912,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8176,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5633,"joy":0.0099,"surprise":0.0191,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.3585,"anger":0.0337,"disgust":0.0075},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The SHERLOCK framework is deployed on JD.com and improves the efficiency of case investigation workflows.

However, the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08952","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.635879","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Zhihan Zhang, Xunkai Li, Yilong Zuo, Zhenjun Li, Bing Zhou, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang","raw_content_length":1469,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["LAGA"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1468,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLM Agents","An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach","TAGs","Announce Type","new Abstract","Text-attributed graphs","a powerful representation","structural connections","fine-grained semantics","a wide range"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLM Agents":2.0,"An Automated Data Quality Improvement Approach":2.0,"TAGs":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Text-attributed graphs":1.0,"a powerful representation":1.0,"structural connections":1.0,"fine-grained semantics":1.0,"a wide range":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7631409491666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.417,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8834,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8869,"joy":0.0379,"surprise":0.0487,"sadness":0.0033,"fear":0.0054,"anger":0.0116,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a novel method (LAGA) for improving data quality in text-attributed graphs, which could indirectly improve the performance of GNNs used in various sustainability applications.

Recently, Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm. Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform, we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory tracking in 3D space.

Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ab7b7c15d5ed","title":"EcphoryRAG: Re","content":"arXiv:2510.08958v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\\% compared to other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search across the knowledge graph.

Extensive evaluations on the 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from 0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG.

However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty, DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08959","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.637922","language":"en","tags":["csai","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Jinxin Shi, Zongsheng Cao, Runmin Ma, Yusong Hu, Jie Zhou, Xin Li, Lei Bai, Liang He, Bo Zhang","raw_content_length":1518,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DualResearch"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1517,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008959v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The deep-research framework","external tools","complex multi-step scientific reasoning","the native limits","a single large language model","context pollution","weak evidentiary support","brittle execution paths"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["The deep-research framework"],"ai_ml":["a single large language model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008959v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The deep-research framework":1.0,"external tools":1.0,"complex multi-step scientific reasoning":1.0,"the native limits":1.0,"a single large language model":1.0,"context pollution":1.0,"weak evidentiary support":1.0,"brittle execution paths":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7632163744444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.4469999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5106,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8597,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0272,"sadness":0.0332,"fear":0.0167,"anger":0.0297,"disgust":0.0281},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI framework (DualResearch) that improves the accuracy of scientific reasoning performed by large language models using external tools.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e940f47d9cf5","title":"Unleashing Perception","content":"arXiv:2510.08964v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08964","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.638761","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cscl","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Yifan Li, Zhenghao Chen, Ziheng Wu, Kun Zhou, Ruipu Luo, Can Zhang, Zhentao He, Yufei Zhan, Wayne Xin Zhao, Minghui Qiu","raw_content_length":1665,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Vision-Language Models","DisTANCE","Perception-Time Scaling"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1664,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Unleashing Perception","arXiv251008964v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","inference-time scaling","particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning","verifiable rewards","the reasoning capabilities","Large Vision-Language Models","LVLMs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Unleashing Perception":2.0,"arXiv251008964v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"inference-time scaling":1.0,"particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning":1.0,"verifiable rewards":1.0,"the reasoning capabilities":1.0,"Large Vision-Language Models":1.0,"LVLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7632455002777774,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.200999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8402,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8932,"joy":0.0143,"surprise":0.0566,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0093,"anger":0.0162,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to improving visual perception in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).

The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08966","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.639590","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Ruitong Liu, Yan Wen, Te Sun, Yunjia Wu, Pingyang Huang, Zihang Yu, Siyuan Li","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module","SCT","LLM","Semantic arXiv:2510.08966v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008966v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Knowledge Graphs","Large Language Models","knowledge-intensive tasks","knowledge graph completion","The prevailing paradigm","prefix-tuning","knowledge embeddings","text inputs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008966v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Knowledge Graphs":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"knowledge-intensive tasks":1.0,"knowledge graph completion":1.0,"The prevailing paradigm":1.0,"prefix-tuning":1.0,"knowledge embeddings":1.0,"text inputs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763274281666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7214,"joy":0.0089,"surprise":0.0113,"sadness":0.0139,"fear":0.0623,"anger":0.0944,"disgust":0.0879},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (SCT) for improving knowledge reasoning in Large Language Models by fusing knowledge graphs.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_bfdec1abc637","title":"Learning Regularizers: Learning Optimizers that can Regularize","content":"arXiv:2510.08968v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization. Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental question: \\textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.

Concepts are C++'s way to express constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library. Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept type-matching, and definition checking.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08969","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.640427","language":"en","tags":["research","csse","preprints","cspl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Bjarne Stroustrup","raw_content_length":1231,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["C++"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1230,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Concept","Concepts","arXiv251008969v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","programming techniques","the facilities","principles","C generic programming","concepts","Cs way"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["programming techniques","C generic programming"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Concept":2.0,"Concepts":2.0,"arXiv251008969v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"programming techniques":1.0,"the facilities":1.0,"principles":1.0,"C generic programming":1.0,"concepts":1.0,"Cs way":1.0}},"age_hours":2.76330665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8541,"joy":0.098,"surprise":0.0265,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0024,"anger":0.0105,"disgust":0.0055},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents programming techniques using C++ concepts.

In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below 4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08970","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.640819","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Zhenyu Wang, Mahathir Monjur, Shahriar Nirjon","raw_content_length":1087,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1086,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["mmJoints","Joint Representations","arXiv251008970v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","mmWave-based pose estimation","sparse signals","weak reflections","models","body joints"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"mmJoints":3.0,"Joint Representations":2.0,"arXiv251008970v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"mmWave-based pose estimation":1.0,"sparse signals":1.0,"weak reflections":1.0,"models":1.0,"body joints":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7633231466666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7581,"joy":0.0134,"surprise":0.0645,"sadness":0.0357,"fear":0.0227,"anger":0.0535,"disgust":0.052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework (mmJoints) that improves mmWave-based pose estimation, enhancing interpretability and downstream task accuracy.

However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08976","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.641627","language":"en","tags":["csdc","csir","research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Maoliang Li, Ke Li, Yaoyang Liu, Jiayu Chen, Zihao Zheng, Yinjun Wu, Xiang Chen","raw_content_length":1260,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MVR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1259,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hierarchical Scheduling","Multi","arXiv251008976v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","user-specific data","retrieval augmented generation","RAG","multimodal large language model MLLM applications","conventional retrieval approaches","limited retrieval accuracy"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["RAG"],"renewable_energy":["RAG"],"ai_ml":["multimodal large language model MLLM applications"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hierarchical Scheduling":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251008976v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"user-specific data":1.0,"retrieval augmented generation":1.0,"RAG":1.0,"multimodal large language model MLLM applications":1.0,"conventional retrieval approaches":1.0,"limited retrieval accuracy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7633557591666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8848,"joy":0.0043,"surprise":0.027,"sadness":0.034,"fear":0.0101,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0266},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel hierarchical scheduling framework for image retrieval that reduces computation.

Reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias: the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses, with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\\rho_{\\text{noise}}$, $\\rho_{\\text{selfbias}}$, and $\\rho_{\\text{symbias}}$. We find that $\\rho_{\\text{noise}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while $\\rho_{\\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection.

Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal effectiveness in downstream applications.

However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08979","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.642886","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Yuki Nii, Futa Waseda, Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen","raw_content_length":1422,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Uncolorable Examples","Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1421,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Uncolorable Examples","Unauthorized AI Colorization","Perception","arXiv251008979v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","AI-based colorization","remarkable capability","realistic color images","grayscale inputs","risks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Unauthorized AI Colorization"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Uncolorable Examples":3.0,"Unauthorized AI Colorization":2.0,"Perception":2.0,"arXiv251008979v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"AI-based colorization":1.0,"remarkable capability":1.0,"realistic color images":1.0,"grayscale inputs":1.0,"risks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763401512777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.6574999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4685,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.621,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.0051,"sadness":0.0151,"fear":0.2088,"anger":0.1051,"disgust":0.0369},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research introduces a novel method to prevent unauthorized AI colorization, demonstrating effectiveness in degrading colorization quality while maintaining visual appearance on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets.
