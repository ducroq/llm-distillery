{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_6183705d004c","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6334: The Relationship Between External Load and Player Performance in Elite Female 3 × 3 Basketball Games: A Markerless Motion Capture Approach","content":"Background: This study employed a markerless motion capture system to quantify the external game load of elite 3 × 3 basketball players and evaluated its association with game performance. Methods: Twenty-four female 3 × 3 basketball games from the 2024 Paris Olympic Games were analyzed, involving 32 players from eight national teams. A markerless motion capture system was used to collect six categories of external load metrics during games, and 22 types of technical statistics were gathered to determine performance. Collected data were standardized according to live game time (min−1). Repeated-measures correlation analysis was applied to examine the relationships between external load and performance, while mixed-effects models were used to compare external load differences between better- and worse-performing groups (classified by Player Value). Results: The correlations between external load and performance indicators were trivial to small. Accelerations (ACC) were significantly associated with the greatest number of performance indicators (e.g., points, rebounds, 1-point made, key assists), while rebounds were significantly correlated with the largest number of external load metrics (e.g., total distance, low-intensity active distance, high-intensity active distance); however, all correlations remained at the small level (r = 0.16–0.24). No significant differences in external load were observed between players of differing performance groups (p > 0.05). Conclusions: In elite 3 × 3 basketball, external load reflects players’ involvement and effort rather than serving as a primary determinant of game performance. This study provides new empirical evidence on the characteristics of 3 × 3 basketball, suggesting that coaches and strength and conditioning practitioners should adopt a comprehensive perspective when evaluating performance, with external load being more suitable for training regulation and fatigue monitoring.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6334","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.595312","language":"en","tags":["sensors","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":271,"author":"Mingxin Zhang","raw_content_length":2031,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.355,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Relationship Between External Load and Player Performance"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1954,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","The Relationship","External Load","Player Performance","Elite Female","3 Basketball Games","A Markerless Motion Capture Approach","Background","This study"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Relationship":2.0,"External Load":2.0,"Player Performance":2.0,"Elite Female":2.0,"3 Basketball Games":2.0,"A Markerless Motion Capture Approach":2.0,"Background":1.0,"This study":1.0}},"age_hours":13.235446990277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8939,"joy":0.0226,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.0105,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0224},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the relationship between external load and player performance in elite female 3x3 basketball games using markerless motion capture.

Therefore, accurate detection of sulfite content in food is crucial for ensuring food quality and safety. A novel fluorescent probe, BODIPY-Y, composed of a BODIPY derivative and an ethyl cyanoacetate group linked by a carbon–carbon double bond, was synthesized for detecting sulfur dioxide derivatives. When the BODIPY-Y probe interacts with SO32−, the probe exhibits enhanced fluorescence at 514 nm. Spectrometric experiments show that the probe exhibits high sensitivity (LOD: 0.263 μmol/L), a fast response time (50 s) and excellent selectivity for SO32−. Mechanistic studies confirm that the BODIPY-Y probe operates via an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. The carbon–carbon double bond in BODIPY-Y undergoes nucleophilic addition with SO32−, blocking the ICT process and resulting in a blue shift in the fluorescence spectrum. In addition, the probe was applied to quantify SO32− levels in real food samples. The measured concentrations of SO2 in the white sugar and red wine were 15.93 μmol/L and 7.30 μmol/L, respectively, with recovery rates of 77.9–98.1%.

In multi-interference environments, the overlap of interference cross-correlation peaks can mask target signals, weakening radar interference suppression capability. To address this, we propose a joint waveform and filter design method called Multi-Interference Suppression Network (MISNet) for effective interference suppression. First, we develop a design criterion based on suppression coefficients for different interferences, minimizing both cross-correlation energy and interference peak models. Then, for the non-smooth, non-convex optimization problem, we use complex neural networks and gating mechanisms, transforming it into a differentiable problem via end-to-end training to optimize the transmit waveform and receive filter efficiently. Simulation results show that compared to traditional algorithms, MISNet effectively reduces interference cross-correlation peaks and autocorrelation sidelobes in single interference environments; it demonstrates excellent robustness in multi-interference environments, significantly outperforming CNN, PSO, and ANN comparison methods, effectively improving radar interference suppression performance in complex multi-interference scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4023","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:09.634200","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Ming Bai","raw_content_length":1399,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multi-Interference Suppression Network"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1399,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Multi","the advancement","electromagnetic interference","counter-interference technology","complex and unpredictable interference signals","radar detection","tracking","recognition performance"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"the advancement":1.0,"electromagnetic interference":1.0,"counter-interference technology":1.0,"complex and unpredictable interference signals":1.0,"radar detection":1.0,"tracking":1.0,"recognition performance":1.0}},"age_hours":13.237345309444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8207,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.0229,"sadness":0.017,"fear":0.0868,"anger":0.0279,"disgust":0.0161},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method (MISNet) for improving radar interference suppression using neural networks.

To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel GIS-based unsupervised classification framework that exploits Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering for the detection and interpretation of urban morphologies. Compared to unsupervised classification approaches that rely on crisp-based clustering algorithms, the proposed FCM-based method more effectively captures heterogeneous urban fabrics where no clear predominance of specific building types exists. Specifically, the method applies fuzzy clustering to census units—considered the fundamental scale of urban analysis—based on construction techniques and building periods. By grouping census areas with similar structural features, the framework provides a flexible, data-driven approach to the characterization of urban settlements. The identification of cluster centroids’ dominant attributes enables a systematic interpretation of the spatial distribution of the built environment, while the subsequent mapping process assigns each cluster a descriptive label reflecting the prevailing building fabric. The generated thematic maps yield critical insights into urban morphology and facilitate evidence-based planning. The framework was validated across ten Italian cities selected for their diverse physical, morphological, and historical characteristics; comparisons with the results of urban zone classifications in these cities conducted by experts show that the proposed method provides accurate results, as the similarity to the classifications made by experts, measured by the use of the Adjusted Rand Index, is always higher than or equal to 0.93; furthermore, it is robust when applied in heterogeneous urban settlements. These results confirm the effectiveness of the method in delineating homogeneous urban areas, thereby offering decision makers a robust instrument to guide targeted interventions on existing building stocks. The proposed framework advances the capacity to analyze urban form, to strategically support renovation and urban regeneration policies, and demonstrates a strong potential for portability, as it can be applied to other cities for urban scale analyses.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4022","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:09.634853","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":323,"author":"Vittorio Miraglia","raw_content_length":2431,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.615,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fuzzy C-Means","Machine Learning"],"persons":["Deep Learning","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2401,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A GIS","The classification","urban residential settlements","Machine Learning","Deep Learning","a complex task","the intrinsic heterogeneity","urban environments"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine Learning","Deep Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A GIS":2.0,"The classification":1.0,"urban residential settlements":1.0,"Machine Learning":1.0,"Deep Learning":1.0,"a complex task":1.0,"the intrinsic heterogeneity":1.0,"urban environments":1.0}},"age_hours":13.237374324722223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.8709999999999996,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9225,"joy":0.0069,"surprise":0.0357,"sadness":0.0027,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.0143,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a GIS-based unsupervised classification framework for urban residential settlements using machine learning.

However, these proposals largely disregard the vast majority of moral patients in existence: non-human animals. AI systems aligned through proposals which largely disregard concern for animal welfare pose significant near-term and long-term animal welfare risks. In this paper, we argue that we should prevent harm to non-human animals, when this does not involve significant costs, and therefore that we have strong moral reasons to at least align AI systems with a basic level of concern for animal welfare. We show how AI alignment with such a concern could be achieved, and why we should expect it to significantly reduce the harm non-human animals would otherwise endure as a result of continued AI development. We provide some recommended policies that AI companies and governmental bodies should consider implementing to ensure basic animal welfare protection.","source":"science_philosophy_technology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-025-00979-1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:14.868677","language":"en","tags":["technology","philosophy","society","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Latest Results","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1035,"priority":8,"update_frequency":168,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1028,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["AI Alignment","The Case","Animals","proposals","AI systems","non-human animals","AI alignment efforts","humans","them","human intentions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI Alignment"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"AI Alignment":2.0,"The Case":2.0,"Animals":2.0,"proposals":2.0,"AI systems":2.0,"non-human animals":2.0,"AI alignment efforts":1.0,"humans":1.0,"them":1.0,"human intentions":1.0}},"age_hours":13.237982481388888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5531,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0034,"sadness":0.0215,"fear":0.04,"anger":0.2647,"disgust":0.11},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes aligning AI systems with animal welfare, which could indirectly reduce environmental harm caused by AI-driven activities (e.g., resource extraction, energy consumption).

Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special weighted energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\\lambda,\\mu$ and the weighted function $\\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible to extend the previous linear null controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs by applying the fixed-point argument in an appropriate Banach space.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13455","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:31.372719","language":"en","tags":["mathoc","preprints","mathpr","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Lei Zhang, Fan Xu, Bin Liu","raw_content_length":1057,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":["backward","Sobolev"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\theta$"]},"char_count":1056,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["New global Carleman estimates","controllability","forwardbackward","linear forward resp","backward parabolic SPDEs","Announce Type","Abstract","this paper","the null controllability","parabolic SPDEs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"New global Carleman estimates":2.0,"controllability":2.0,"forwardbackward":2.0,"linear forward resp":2.0,"backward parabolic SPDEs":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"the null controllability":1.0,"parabolic SPDEs":1.0}},"age_hours":9.244550133611112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8589,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0205,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0399,"anger":0.0431,"disgust":0.0175},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical mathematical research on null controllability for parabolic SPDEs.

In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids.

We aimed to reveal the subtype-specific expression of the CLPB gene in breast cancer, its effect on survival, and genetic/epigenetic alterations that might regulate the expression. Methods: Expression levels and prognostic signatures of CLPB gene in breast cancer patients were evaluated by using in-silico tools. RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR methods are used to examine CLPB expression in cell lines. Genetic alterations of CLPB were revealed by employing Sanger Cosmic database. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and UALCAN tool were used to examine the methylation status of the CLPB promoter in cell lines and samples, respectively. Results: CLPB expression is significantly higher in all breast cancer subtypes compared to normals, and it is associated with worse survival values. Genetic alterations of CLPB are rare. Cell lines express CLPB gene at moderate to high levels. The promoter region of CLPB is hypomethylated in samples and cell lines. Conclusions: We suggest CLPB gene as a therapeutic target and biomarker candidate in breast cancer. The rarity of genetic alterations suggests that they do not affect CLPB regulation, but promoter hypomethylation would be one of the reasons for its high expression in breast cancer.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681854v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:57:09.309057","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"SONMEZ, S., NOYAN, S., ACUN, T.","raw_content_length":1301,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Sanger Cosmic","RT-PCR"],"persons":["CLPB","Background","Q-RT-PCR"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1301,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["breast cancer","Hypomethylation","CLPB overexpression","which","poor survival outcomes","CLPB","oncogenic properties","leukemia","melanoma","the subtype-specific expression"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"breast cancer":3.0,"Hypomethylation":2.0,"CLPB overexpression":2.0,"which":2.0,"poor survival outcomes":2.0,"CLPB":2.0,"oncogenic properties":1.0,"leukemia":1.0,"melanoma":1.0,"the subtype-specific expression":1.0}},"age_hours":13.249038831944443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.2310000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9538,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6247,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0129,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.205,"anger":0.0552,"disgust":0.0816},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies a potential therapeutic target (CLPB gene) for breast cancer based on observed hypomethylation and overexpression.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_f246df5e2085","title":"Causal Modeling Reveals Cell-Cell Communication Dynamics in the Tumor Microenvironment During Anti","content":"Background: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 plays a crucial role in breast cancer treatment. Despite clinical success, how ICB reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) to enhance anti-tumor activity remains unclear. Anti-PD-1 therapy alters TME cells beyond PD-1+ T cells, with extensive cell-cell communication (CCC) playing a key role. Understanding the dynamic CCC changes upon anti-PD-1 treatment can illuminate ICB mechanisms of action and TME dynamics. Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from 31 breast cancer patients before and after anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) treatment (Bassez et al., 2021). We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by treatment in major cell types. We then applied an instrumental variable approach to uncover causal relationships between T-cell and non-T-cell DEGs. We further mapped ligand-receptor interactions mediating signal transduction between cells and constructed a CCC network from T to non-T cells. Results: Anti-PD-1 therapy induced widespread transcriptional changes across multiple cell populations. Key pathways modulated in T cells included NFkB, interferon-{gamma}, and interleukin signaling. CD4+ and CD8+ exhausted T cells engaged in distinct ligand-receptor interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and other types of cells, reshaping the TME. Our results indicated CD4+ exhausted T cells activated M1-like TAMs via TNF-TNFRSF1A and TNFSF14-LTBR, while CD8+ exhausted T cells engaged M1-like TAMs through ICAM1-ITGAL/ITGB2 and CCL8-CCR2, promoting anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, immunosuppressive interactions were also observed, such as TNF-TNFRSF1B (TNFR2) and TNFSF14-TNFRSF14 (HVEM) from CD4+ T cells, as well as CSF1-CSF1R and RPS19-C5AR1 from CD8+ T cells, which likely promote M2-like tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization and contribute to pro-tumor immune regulation and resistance to therapy. Notably, key receptors in the causal CCC networks, such as C5AR1, TNFR2, and CSF1R, emerged as potential targets to enhance anti-PD-1 efficacy. Conclusions: These findings elucidate TME remodeling during anti-PD-1 therapy and underscore the pivotal role of CCC in treatment response.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_f4018987e11f","title":"Hippocampal transformations occur along dimensions of memory interference","content":"The role of the hippocampus in resolving memory interference has been greatly elucidated by considering the relationship between the similarity of visual stimuli (input) and corresponding similarity of hippocampal activity patterns (output). However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682242v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:57:09.310820","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Mirjalili, S., Guo, W., Graetz, D., Wang, E., Mayr, U., Kuhl, B.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_a5346600a71b","title":"Neural Phoneme Processing in Children with and without Dyslexia","content":"This study investigates the neural dynamics of phoneme processing in 7-year-old children with and without dyslexia (25;9 male), using EEG recordings collected during continuous speech listening. By applying temporal generalization to phonetic descriptor decoding, we can disentangle whether potential phoneme processing deficits are due to the maintenance of phonemes in verbal short-term memory and/or inferred differences in phonetic processing speed, both of which are thought to be impaired in dyslexia. We investigated whether phonetic processing depends on the phoneme's position or its lexical competition. Our results reveal two key findings that may help explain the challenges faced by children with dyslexia. First, these children exhibit reduced decoding accuracy for word-onset phonemes, suggesting disruptions in either predictive, word-level anticipatory mechanisms or in the intrinsic rhythmic processing aligned with word boundaries. Second, they exhibit increased decoding accuracy for non-onset phonemes with low lexical competition approximately 400 ms after phoneme onset. This pattern suggests that children with dyslexia retain linguistically less relevant sounds longer in verbal short-term memory and process them more slowly compared to their typical reading peers. Together, these findings suggest that dyslexia is characterized by altered phonetic encoding strategies, specifically inefficient prioritization of relevant phonological information. This work provides new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying phonological deficits and contributes to a deeper understanding of the cognitive basis of dyslexia.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682108v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:57:09.311348","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Gillis, M., Kries, J., Wouters, J., Gwilliams, L., Vandermosten, M.","raw_content_length":1643,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Neural Phoneme Processing","EEG"],"persons":["Dyslexia"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1643,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Neural Phoneme Processing","Children","Dyslexia","This study","the neural dynamics","phoneme processing","7-year-old children","dyslexia","259 male","EEG recordings"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Neural Phoneme Processing":2.0,"Children":2.0,"Dyslexia":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the neural dynamics":1.0,"phoneme processing":1.0,"7-year-old children":1.0,"dyslexia":1.0,"259 male":1.0,"EEG recordings":1.0}},"age_hours":13.249155714722221,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.765,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0181,"sadness":0.015,"fear":0.0856,"anger":0.0321,"disgust":0.0795},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates neural processing in children with dyslexia using EEG recordings.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_3a3c0fdc5544","title":"Early developmental characterization of gap","content":"Introduction: Atypical sensory processing, particularly auditory hypersensitivity, is a common and debilitating phenotype of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Electrophysiology studies in FMR1-knockout (KO) mice previously observed hyperexcitability at the auditory cortex (AC), with enhanced neuronal firing to auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral measure of sensorimotor gating, is robustly impaired in FXS individuals. Interestingly, a related paradigm called gap-induced inhibition of the acoustic startle (GPIAS) is mediated by the AC, and a previous study observed decreased GPIAS in mature FMR1-KO mice. Further, habituation is also an important sensory filtering mechanism, which has been reported to be impaired in mature FMR1-KO mice. However, not much is known about GPIAS and habituation in FMR1-KO mice during early development. Methods: We evaluated GPIAS in male and female FMR1-KO mice at post-natal days 15 (P15), 20 (P20) and 30 (P30). The paradigm consisted of a prepulse stimulus (a gap in a continuous background noise) followed by a startle stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval of 50 or 100 ms. Habituation was assessed prior to the GPIAS trials, with a series of startle only stimulus. Results: We observed a trend for genotype difference in acoustic startle response (ASR) magnitude, particularly in the female mice at P30. No significant genotype differences were noted in GPIAS or latency of ASR. Response duration was significantly increased in the male FMR1-KO mice compared to their WT counterparts during early development. Significant genotype differences were also observed in habituation and sensitization. In terms of development, we observed a significant increase in GPIAS with maturation. Furthermore, we also observed significant changes in the magnitude, response latency and duration of ASR with maturation. Finally, significant sex differences were observed in ASR magnitude and duration. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that behavioral responses to auditory stimuli are dynamic during development and differ between females and males, an important consideration for future study design. Additionally, the FMR1-KO mice display habituation deficits during early development, which could be an ideal window for addressing auditory hypersensitivity in FXS.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682100v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:57:09.311710","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":331,"author":"Abdullah, A., Liu, X., Murari, K., Yan, J., Cheng, N.","raw_content_length":2313,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.655,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fragile X Syndrome","FXS","P15","GPIAS"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2313,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Early developmental characterization","gap","Introduction","Atypical sensory processing","particularly auditory hypersensitivity","a common and debilitating phenotype","Fragile X Syndrome","FXS","Electrophysiology studies","FMR1-knockout KO mice"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Early developmental characterization"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Early developmental characterization":2.0,"gap":2.0,"Introduction":1.0,"Atypical sensory processing":1.0,"particularly auditory hypersensitivity":1.0,"a common and debilitating phenotype":1.0,"Fragile X Syndrome":1.0,"FXS":1.0,"Electrophysiology studies":1.0,"FMR1-knockout KO mice":1.0}},"age_hours":13.249172515833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3229,"joy":0.0036,"surprise":0.0612,"sadness":0.2038,"fear":0.1825,"anger":0.0171,"disgust":0.2087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on auditory processing in mice with Fragile X Syndrome.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_99415cf38054","title":"Right time, right place: Heterochronicity shapes brain network formation","content":"Brain network formation unfolds on a non-uniform developmental timetable, with different cortical regions generating connections at different developmental phases. Generative network models (GNMs) aim to uncover the principles underpinning the organisation of connectomes by creating synthetic networks according to simple computational rules. These models capture the connectome's topology, operationalised here as the overall distributions of network metrics (e.g., modularity, small-worldness, rich-club structure). However, they typically ignore the differential timing of connectivity formation. By omitting this temporal programme, GNMs often misplace topological features in physical space. Here, we add a heterochronous growth term to GNMs and use a new model fitness function that weighs topology and topography equally. Topography refers to the spatial embedding of the network, the actual anatomical positions of tracts. With these advances, we can generate synthetic networks that more faithfully reproduce the spatial layout of diffusion-MRI connectomes from two independent adult cohorts. Compared with classical, temporally agnostic models, heterochronous simulations improve model fit, accurately locate cortical hubs and modules, and converge on a single caudal-to-rostral gradient of brain maturation. Integrating heterochronicity makes GNMs more faithful to brain development, setting the stage for using them to explain and ultimately predict individual differences in network formation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682136v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:57:09.311987","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Poli, F., Oldham, S., Mousley, A., Bullmore, E.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_ff69ff0726f9","title":"The 5 next big things in sustainability and energy","content":"After federal funding for renewables evaporated this year, the future path of the energy sector has been unclear. But even in uncertain times, companies are advancing the technology needed to push for a clean-energy transition—while also accommodating for a new grid that needs to keep up with the huge power demands of the wave of data centers coming online. From new battery tech to all-day solar power to better ways to track emissions and more, these innovations can help see the sector through this precarious period. ExowattFor generating solar power even when the sun isn’t shiningExowatt’s P3 unit is a power plant in a 40-foot-long shipping container. The unit uses solar energy to heat a thermal battery—essentially a very hot piece of clay—that can then provide consistent power from solar even at night. The modular design will allow a series of P3 units to be quickly deployed to power new data centers without overwhelming the existing grid and needs no rare earth materials like lithium to operate. The company has raised $70 million so far from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Open AI’s CEO Sam Altman. General MotorsFor rolling out a new kind of batteryLithium batteries may only have one element in the name, but they also require quite a bit of nickel and cobalt, two rare earth elements that have expensive (and sometimes ethically fraught) supply chains. Researchers at General Motors say they have recently made a breakthrough with a new kind of lithium-manganese rich (LMR) battery, which uses cheap and abundant manganese. Besides solving supply chain and cost issues, the automaker’s innovation has also addressed old issues with LMRs losing charge quickly. The company is planning to roll out its new formulation batteries by 2028, and it says they could boost the range of its EVs to 400 miles per charge. GreenlaneFor building the electric truck charging infrastructure networkAs the electrification wave comes for freight trucking fleets, the truck stop must also evolve, providing fast charging for large vehicles on highways around the country. Greenlane, a company founded with backing from Daimler Truck North America and BlackRock’s climate fund, aims for widespread deployment of its Greenlane High-Speed Charging System, with 12 pull-through lane 400 kW chargers. The company opened its flagship charging station on I-15 Southern California in April 2025 and plans to expand to electrify the entire highway from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. PersefoniFor powering climate reporting, with some help from AIAs governments around the world demand more climate disclosure from companies, the time and money it takes to keep track of all the data can be daunting, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. Climate accounting software company Persefoni’s newest Pro offering helps those companies collect and report that data—even Scope 3 emissions, involving emissions from suppliers and customers, which are notoriously hard to track. To solve the problem, the software’s Scope 3 Data Exchange lets companies request emissions data directly from their suppliers. It also uses generative AI to help generate reports and ensure compliance with major emissions standards around the world. In its first year available, the software amassed more than 6,000 users. X, the Moonshot FactoryFor building the first map of the entire gridThere is currently no working map of the world’s electric grid. Tapestry, a project from Google’s X, the Moonshot Factory, is working to change that. The effort—now active in the U.S., U.K., Chile, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, is combining AI-powered inspection and advanced simulation tools to help operators plan, maintain, and scale the grid. Its two products use machine learning to help quickly inspect grids and solve problems and to plan for future grid expansion. This year, the company began partnering with Chinese operators. It’s also helping PJM—the largest grid operator in North America—model ways to bring renewable sources online faster. The companies and individuals behind these technologies are among the honorees in Fast Company’s Next Big Things in Tech awards for 2025.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_f1d9e6169b11","title":"The 5 next big things in computing, chips, and foundational technology for 2025","content":"The companies that create the foundational technologies that enable other companies’ progress are embracing AI, of course. But that’s only part of the story. These honorees made big progress in 2025 on quantum computing, battery science, and other fronts. AIStormFor giving sensors the power of neural networks AIStorm’s technology pushes AI to the edge of computing experiences by allowing sensors to run neural networks—a feat with applications everywhere from consumer electronics to factory-floor robotics. The company has a deal with Audioscenic to put latency-free, position-adaptive 3D sound in laptops, monitors, and soundbars starting in 2026. AlediaFor charting a bright future for AR glassesFor AR glasses to have a shot at catching on, they need display technology that’s compact, power-efficient, and capable of rendering bright imagery. Aledia’s 3D nanowire microLEDs emit red, green, and blue light from a single chip—a key to achieving those goals. To ensure scalable quality control, the company has invested $200 million in its own manufacturing line in Grenoble, France. ClassiqFor helping experts harness quantum computing’s advancesAs quantum computing’s potential to blaze through algorithms that classical computers can’t tackle at all edges toward reality, it’s time to think about implementing specific applications in a range of domains. Domain experts at companies such as BMW, Rolls-Royce, and Deloitte use Classiq’s Qmod functional modeling language to design programs. Deep knowledge of quantum computing is not required. And the results run on cloud platforms from Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. D-WaveFor showing what quantum computing can do right nowThe future of quantum computers is all about getting the technology out of the lab and into the real world. Available both as a cloud service and in an on-premises form, D-Wave’s sixth-generation Advantage2 computer packs more than 4,400 qubits, the building blocks of quantum computing’s unprecedented capabilities. Customers such as defense contractor Davidson Technologies are already using the Advantage2, whose “annealing” technology sets it apart from the more common gate-based designs used by other quantum computer manufacturers. In March, D-Wave reported that the Advantage2 performed a calculation job that would have taken the U.S. Department of Energy’s Frontier supercomputer almost a million years to complete. EnovixFor building a battery for the AI eraThanks in part to AI, devices such as smartphones, headsets, and smart glasses are rapidly evolving. But most are still dependent on lithium-ion batteries, a technology that long ago plateaued—and, under certain circumstance, can be dangerous. Enovix’s fully active silicon anode batteries house strips of silicon in a steel container, overcoming the risk of swelling and damage that’s inherent to lithium-ion battery design. The company, whose next-generation EX-2M battery offers 22% more energy density than lithium-ion, says it has agreements with large manufacturers of smartphones, mixed-reality headsets, and IoT products to adopt its batteries in upcoming devices. The companies and individuals behind these technologies are among the honorees in Fast Company’s Next Big Things in Tech awards for 2025.
