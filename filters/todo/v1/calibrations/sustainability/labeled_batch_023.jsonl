As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08180","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.266785","language":"en","tags":["research","csdc","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Natalie Carl, Tobias Pfandzelter, David Bermbach","raw_content_length":1418,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1413,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Energy","arXiv251008180v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Serverless computing","time","rapid elasticity","a finely-grained pricing model","full control","resource allocation"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["Energy"],"renewable_energy":["Energy"],"ai_ml":["a finely-grained pricing model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Energy":2.0,"arXiv251008180v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Serverless computing":1.0,"time":1.0,"rapid elasticity":1.0,"a finely-grained pricing model":1.0,"full control":1.0,"resource allocation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774323213888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.453999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6908,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9491,"joy":0.0076,"surprise":0.0231,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0032,"anger":0.0078,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":7,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel hardware architecture for serverless computing to reduce energy consumption.

However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately, refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08181","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.267159","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Haoran Yu, Yi Shi","raw_content_length":1366,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Joint Text Instructions and Object Dragging for Interactive Image Editing"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1365,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Joint Text Instructions","Object","Interactive Image Editing","arXiv251008181v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","image","great potential","image editing","techniques","text-based and object-dragging methods"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Joint Text Instructions":2.0,"Object":2.0,"Interactive Image Editing":2.0,"arXiv251008181v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"image":1.0,"great potential":1.0,"image editing":1.0,"techniques":1.0,"text-based and object-dragging methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7743385116666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9316,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.0211,"sadness":0.0139,"fear":0.0103,"anger":0.0087,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel image editing framework.

Addressing this challenge is crucial for the sustainability of space operations. To plan a safe trajectory in the presence of moving space debris, an integrated approach of artificial potential field and sliding mode controller is proposed and implemented in this paper. The relative 6-DOF kinematics and dynamics of the spacecraft is modelled in the framework of geometric mechanics with the relative configuration expressed through exponential coordinates. Various collision avoidance guidance algorithms have been proposed in the literature but the Artificial Potential Field guidance algorithm is computationally efficient and enables real-time path adjustments to avoid collision with obstacles. However, it is prone to issues such as local minima. In literature, local minima issue is typically avoided by either redefining the potential function such as adding vorticity or by employing search techniques which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, a physics-informed APF is proposed in this paper where Hamiltonian mechanics is used instead of the traditional Newtonian mechanics-based approach. In this approach, instead of relying on attractive and repulsive forces for path planning, the Hamiltonian approach uses the potential field to define a path of minimum potential. Additionally, to track the desired trajectory planned by the guidance algorithm within a fixed-time frame, a non-singular fixed-time sliding mode controller (FTSMC) is used. The proposed fixed-time sliding surface not only ensures fixed-time convergence of system states but also guarantees the global stability of the closed-loop system without singularity. The simulation results presented support the claims made.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08184","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.267598","language":"en","tags":["cssy","computer-science","eesssy","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Paridhi Choudhary, Manoranjan Sinha","raw_content_length":1927,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.36,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Artificial Potential Field","Control using Physics arXiv:2510.08184v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1926,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Satellite Navigation","Control","Physics","space debris","arXiv251008184v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the number","space exploration missions","the accumulation","risk"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Control"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Satellite Navigation":2.0,"Control":2.0,"Physics":2.0,"space debris":2.0,"arXiv251008184v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the number":1.0,"space exploration missions":1.0,"the accumulation":1.0,"risk":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7743532894444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4485,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4897,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4442,"joy":0.0129,"surprise":0.0184,"sadness":0.0179,"fear":0.4623,"anger":0.0379,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel approach to satellite navigation to avoid space debris, which is crucial for the long-term sustainability of space operations.

The opinions are represented as vectors on the unit $(d-1)$-sphere, and the update rule is based on the overall correlation between the relevant vectors. The update rule reflects the assumption of biased assimilation, i.e., a pair of opinions is brought closer together if their correlation is positive and further apart if the correlation is negative. This model seems to induce the polarization of opinions into two antipodal groups. This is in contrast to many other known models which tend to achieve consensus. The polarization property has been recently proved for $d=2$, but the general case of $d \\ge 3$ remained open. In this work, we settle the general case, using a more detailed understanding of the model dynamics and tools from the theory of random processes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08190","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.269294","language":"en","tags":["cssi","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Abdou Majeed Alidou, J\\'ulia Balig\\'acs, Jan H\\k{a}z{\\l}a","raw_content_length":947,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["about $d$","$d=2$","$d \\ge 3$"]},"char_count":944,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Geometric opinion exchange","every dimension","arXiv251008190v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A recent line","work studies models","opinion exchange","agent","about d topics","The opinions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Geometric opinion exchange":2.0,"every dimension":2.0,"arXiv251008190v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A recent line":1.0,"work studies models":1.0,"opinion exchange":1.0,"agent":1.0,"about d topics":1.0,"The opinions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7744165994444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8134,"joy":0.0351,"surprise":0.1303,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.0087,"disgust":0.0035},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on opinion polarization.

However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08191","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.269748","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":244,"author":"Yuzheng Cai, Siqi Cai, Yuchen Shi, Zihan Xu, Lichao Chen, Yulei Qin, Xiaoyu Tan, Gang Li, Zongyi Li, Haojia Lin, Yong Mao, Ke Li, Xing Sun","raw_content_length":1807,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.22,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GRPO","Group Relative Policy Optimization","SFT","Training-Free Group","a Reinforcement Learning"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1806,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008191v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","Large Language Model LLM agents","their promising general capabilities","their performance","specialized real-world domains","challenges","external tools","specific prompting strategies"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Model LLM agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008191v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"Large Language Model LLM agents":1.0,"their promising general capabilities":1.0,"their performance":1.0,"specialized real-world domains":1.0,"challenges":1.0,"external tools":1.0,"specific prompting strategies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7744310616666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9203,"joy":0.0069,"surprise":0.035,"sadness":0.017,"fear":0.0045,"anger":0.0097,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (Training-Free GRPO) to improve LLM agent performance in specialized domains without parameter updates, potentially reducing the computational cost and energy consumption associated with training large models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9f5a28443248","title":"The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.08197v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i) elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons, (ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii) derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix.

Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus it can handle interval and ratio scales.

We present an open-source human-SAV conversational dataset, comprising both textual data (e.g., 2,136 human-SAV exchanges) and empirical data (e.g., post-interaction survey results on a range of psychological factors). The dataset's utility is demonstrated through two benchmark case studies: First, using random forest modeling and chord diagrams, we identify key predictors of SAV acceptance and perceived service quality, highlighting the critical influence of response sentiment polarity (i.e., perceived positivity). Second, we benchmark the performance of an LLM-based sentiment analysis tool against the traditional lexicon-based TextBlob method.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0cf239927232","title":"Memory Retrieval and Consolidation in Large Language Models through Function Tokens","content":"arXiv:2510.08203v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens (usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select the most predictive features from context.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08203","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.271788","language":"en","tags":["cscl","computer-science","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Shaohua Zhang, Yuan Lin, Hang Li","raw_content_length":1602,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Function Tokens"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1601,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Memory Retrieval","Consolidation","Large Language Models","Function Tokens","LLMs","the memory","Announce Type","new Abstract","The remarkable success","large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Memory Retrieval":2.0,"Consolidation":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"Function Tokens":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"the memory":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The remarkable success":1.0,"large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774506382222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5447,"joy":0.0576,"surprise":0.3532,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0147,"anger":0.0185,"disgust":0.0066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a hypothesis about how LLMs retrieve and consolidate memory, supported by experimental evidence using bipartite graph analysis and case studies.

In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph.

In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08211","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.272614","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csai","cscl","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"XuHao Hu, Peng Wang, Xiaoya Lu, Dongrui Liu, Xuanjing Huang, Jing Shao","raw_content_length":1524,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1523,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Emergent Misalignment","Dishonesty","Misaligned Samples","Biased Human","new Abstract","Previous research","malicious or incorrect completions","narrow domains","harmful behaviors"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs"],"research_academic":["Previous research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"Emergent Misalignment":2.0,"Dishonesty":2.0,"Misaligned Samples":2.0,"Biased Human":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Previous research":1.0,"malicious or incorrect completions":1.0,"narrow domains":1.0,"harmful behaviors":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7745364080555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.6165,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4767,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2806,"joy":0.0035,"surprise":0.0061,"sadness":0.0212,"fear":0.1384,"anger":0.3669,"disgust":0.1834},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents research on LLMs and their potential for emergent dishonesty.

Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce and release a new dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction.

However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08218","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.273863","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Nicolas Espinosa-Dice, Kiante Brantley, Wen Sun","raw_content_length":1570,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Expressive Valu"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1569,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Expressive Value Learning","Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning","arXiv251008218v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Reinforcement learning","a powerful paradigm","sequences","decisions","robotics","its lack"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Expressive Value Learning":2.0,"Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning":2.0,"arXiv251008218v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Reinforcement learning":1.0,"a powerful paradigm":1.0,"sequences":1.0,"decisions":1.0,"robotics":1.0,"its lack":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774580457222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9057,"joy":0.028,"surprise":0.0179,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0178,"anger":0.015,"disgust":0.0107},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new approach to offline reinforcement learning (EVOR) that aims to improve scalability.

We propose two training strategies and show on real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0f9e01d59899","title":"Selection, Reflection and Self","content":"arXiv:2510.08222v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models, especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges. Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First, the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework, called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over 10$\\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku and Maze tasks over the recent advances.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08222","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.274692","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Yunlong Deng, Boyang Sun, Yan Li, Lingjing Kong, Zeyu Tang, Kun Zhang, Guangyi Chen","raw_content_length":1854,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.29,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Sudoku"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1853,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Selection","Reflection","Self","reasoning tasks","Announce Type","new Abstract","their inherent complexity","rigorous benchmarks","the capabilities","machine learning models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["machine learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Selection":2.0,"Reflection":2.0,"Self":2.0,"reasoning tasks":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"their inherent complexity":1.0,"rigorous benchmarks":1.0,"the capabilities":1.0,"machine learning models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7746106177777774,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8342,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.039,"sadness":0.038,"fear":0.0168,"anger":0.0322,"disgust":0.0313},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework (SR$^2$) for improving reasoning accuracy in LLMs. The concrete action is the development of this framework and its experimental validation on Sudoku and Maze tasks, achieving a 10% improvement in performance with fewer parameters.

Based on an extensive literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator agreement of Cohen's $\\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead.

This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\\% and sMAPE by 32\\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved.

We present pyGinkgo, a lightweight and Pythonic interface to the Ginkgo library, offering high-performance sparse linear algebra support with platform portability across CUDA, HIP, and OpenMP backends. pyGinkgo bridges the gap between high-performance C++ backends and Python usability by exposing Ginkgo's capabilities via Pybind11 and a NumPy and PyTorch compatible interface.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks, such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs' unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\\%$ over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\\%$ over the base model, underscoring the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework.

Given their grow- ing societal influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propa- gation across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test (PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the in- herent political leanings of these models. Sub- sequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to explore explicit stereotypes across vari- ous social dimensions. In a final step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating mod- els with multilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning polit- ical alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those iden- tified via explicit persona prompting. Interest- ingly, for most models, implicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggest- ing a degree of transparency or \"awareness\" regarding their inherent biases.

In this work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises potential safty risks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08238","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.278220","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Jiyang Qiu, Xinbei Ma, Yunqing Xu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao","raw_content_length":1405,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CoTri","FTR"],"persons":["ben"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1404,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Chain","arXiv251008238v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The rapid deployment","large language model","LLM-based agents","real-world applications","serious concerns","their trustworthiness","this work"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Chain","large language model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Chain":2.0,"arXiv251008238v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The rapid deployment":1.0,"large language model":1.0,"LLM-based agents":1.0,"real-world applications":1.0,"serious concerns":1.0,"their trustworthiness":1.0,"this work":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7747454844444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2991,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0176,"sadness":0.0115,"fear":0.6177,"anger":0.0354,"disgust":0.0139},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents, specifically backdoor attacks.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_392a07693c3f","title":"The Alignment Waltz: Jointly Training Agents to Collaborate for Safety","content":"arXiv:2510.08240v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content, and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets, demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08240","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.278654","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":267,"author":"Jingyu Zhang, Haozhu Wang, Eric Michael Smith, Sid Wang, Amr Sharaf, Mahesh Pasupuleti, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi, Jason Weston, Hongyuan Zhan","raw_content_length":1921,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.335,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["WaltzRL"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1920,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Alignment Waltz","Jointly Training Agents","Safety","arXiv251008240v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","the power","LLMs","a delicate dance","a fundamental tension"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Jointly Training Agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Alignment Waltz":2.0,"Jointly Training Agents":2.0,"Safety":2.0,"arXiv251008240v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the power":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"a delicate dance":1.0,"a fundamental tension":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7747609455555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.637499999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1275,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6953,"joy":0.0111,"surprise":0.0105,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.2111,"anger":0.0402,"disgust":0.024},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework (WaltzRL) to improve the safety and helpfulness of LLMs. The concrete action is the development and testing of this framework, with measurable outcomes showing a reduction in unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench).

We introduce VirTLab, a system that allows researchers and practitioners to design interactive, customizable simulations of team dynamics with LLM-based agents situated in 2D spatial environments. Unlike prior frameworks that restrict scenarios to predefined or static tasks, our approach enables users to build scenarios, assign roles, and observe how agents coordinate, move, and adapt over time. By bridging team cognition behaviors with scalable agent-based modeling, our system provides a testbed for investigating how environments influence coordination, collaboration, and emergent team behaviors. We demonstrate its utility by aligning simulated outcomes with empirical evaluations and a user study, underscoring the importance of customizable environments for advancing research on multi-agent simulations.

This paper focuses on the MIS problem in the Radio Network model, a standard model widely used to model wireless networks, particularly ad hoc wireless and sensor networks. Energy is a premium resource in these networks, which are typically battery-powered. Hence, designing distributed algorithms that use as little energy as possible is crucial. We use the well-established energy model where a node can be sleeping or awake in a round, and only the awake rounds (when it can send or listen) determine the energy complexity of the algorithm, which we want to minimize. We present new, more energy-efficient MIS algorithms in radio networks with arbitrary and unknown graph topology. We present algorithms for two popular variants of the radio model -- with collision detection (CD) and without collision detection (no-CD). Specifically, we obtain the following results: 1. CD model: We present a randomized distributed MIS algorithm with energy complexity $O(\\log n)$, round complexity $O(\\log^2 n)$, and failure probability $1 / poly(n)$, where $n$ is the network size. We show that our energy complexity is optimal by showing a matching $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound. 2. no-CD model: In the more challenging no-CD model, we present a randomized distributed MIS algorithm with energy complexity $O(\\log^2n \\log \\log n)$, round complexity $O(\\log^3 n \\log \\Delta)$, and failure probability $1 / poly(n)$. The energy complexity of our algorithm is significantly lower than the round (and energy) complexity of $O(\\log^3 n)$ of the best known distributed MIS algorithm of Davies [PODC 2023] for arbitrary graph topology.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08244","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.279461","language":"en","tags":["csds","csdc","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":281,"author":"Dominick Banasik, Varsha Dani, Fabien Dufoulon, Aayush Gupta, Thomas P.

A potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular, we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic capabilities.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08245","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.279847","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","csai","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Jannek Ulm, Kevin Du, V\\'esteinn Sn{\\ae}bjarnarson","raw_content_length":1137,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Contrastive Decoding for Synthetic Data Generation in Low arXiv:2510.08245v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1136,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Contrastive Decoding","Synthetic Data Generation","Low","LLMs","arXiv251008245v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language models","huge amounts","textual data","concerns"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Contrastive Decoding":2.0,"Synthetic Data Generation":2.0,"Low":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv251008245v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"huge amounts":1.0,"textual data":1.0,"concerns":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7748076683333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.731,"joy":0.0505,"surprise":0.0342,"sadness":0.0092,"fear":0.1279,"anger":0.0352,"disgust":0.012},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores using synthetic data generated by LLMs to improve language model performance.

In addition, the EU lawmaker intends to adopt specific rules to protect confidentiality of communications, in a separate ePrivacy Regulation. Some have argued that there is no need for such additional rules for communications confidentiality. This Article discusses the protection of the right to confidentiality of communications in Europe. We look at the right's origins to assess the rationale for protecting it. We also analyze how the right is currently protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and under EU law. We show that at its core the right to communications confidentiality protects three individual and collective values: privacy, freedom of expression, and trust in communication services. The right aims to ensure that individuals and organizations can safely entrust communication to service providers. Initially, the right protected only postal letters, but it has gradually developed into a strong safeguard for the protection of confidentiality of communications, regardless of the technology used. Hence, the right does not merely serve individual privacy interests, but also other more collective interests that are crucial for the functioning of our information society. We conclude that separate EU rules to protect communications confidentiality, next to the GDPR, are justified and necessary.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08247","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.280607","language":"en","tags":["cscy","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Frederik J.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d7e8c34f22a7","title":"Opponent Shaping in LLM Agents","content":"arXiv:2510.08255v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma). Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08255","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.281368","language":"en","tags":["csma","computer-science","cslg","preprints","csai","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Marta Emili Garcia Segura, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi","raw_content_length":1524,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1523,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Opponent Shaping","LLM Agents","arXiv251008255v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","LLMs","autonomous agents","real-world environments","these deployments","multi-agent interactions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Agents","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Opponent Shaping":2.0,"LLM Agents":2.0,"arXiv251008255v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"autonomous agents":1.0,"real-world environments":1.0,"these deployments":1.0,"multi-agent interactions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7748691233333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8571,"joy":0.0186,"surprise":0.0407,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0424,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0169},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents research on using LLMs to influence other LLM agents in game-theoretic environments.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a153344405a5","title":"Mix","content":"arXiv:2510.08256v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes; and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08256","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.281794","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","csai","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Jason Bohne, Pawel Polak, David Rosenberg, Brian Bloniarz, Gary Kazantsev","raw_content_length":1632,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Direct Preference Optimization","DPO","MoE-DPO","MoE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1631,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008256v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Direct Preference Optimization","DPO","a simple and effective alternative","reinforcement learning","human feedback","RLHF","large language models","LLMs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["reinforcement learning","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008256v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Direct Preference Optimization":1.0,"DPO":1.0,"a simple and effective alternative":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"human feedback":1.0,"RLHF":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774884096111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.453999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6908,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8789,"joy":0.0184,"surprise":0.0175,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0336,"anger":0.0308,"disgust":0.0161},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (Mix- and MoE-DPO) for improving large language model alignment with user preferences.

Exploiting these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage, predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08260","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.282563","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Mu Li, Yin Wang, Zhiying Leng, Jiapeng Liu, Frederick W.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fdc7492a8d21","title":"Adaptive Gradient Calibration for Single","content":"arXiv:2510.08269v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels. While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC), a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across diverse settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08269","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.283355","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Chenying Liu, Gianmarco Perantoni, Lorenzo Bruzzone, Xiao Xiang Zhu","raw_content_length":1583,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MLC","Remote Sensing","SLC","SPML","Adaptive Gradient Calibration"],"persons":["SPML"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1582,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive Gradient Calibration","MLC","Announce Type","new Abstract","Multi-label classification","a more comprehensive semantic understanding","Remote Sensing RS imagery","traditional single-label classification","SLC","complete annotations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MLC"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive Gradient Calibration":2.0,"MLC":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multi-label classification":1.0,"a more comprehensive semantic understanding":1.0,"Remote Sensing RS imagery":1.0,"traditional single-label classification":1.0,"SLC":1.0,"complete annotations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774943881388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4575000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4915,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9436,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0237,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.0085,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel machine learning framework (AdaGC) for improving the accuracy of remote sensing image classification, which could potentially lead to better monitoring of environmental changes.

Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \\textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process.

These include state-dependent actuator limitations, asymmetric control bounds, and thermal loads that vary with maneuvering conditions. This paper introduces an iterative control allocation method to address these challenges in real time. The proposed algorithm searches for control inputs that achieve the desired moment commands while respecting constraints on input magnitude and rate. For slender HGV configurations, thermal loads and drag generation are strongly correlated-lower drag typically results in reduced surface heating. By embedding drag-sensitive soft constraints, the method improves energy efficiency and implicitly reduces surface temperatures, lowering the vehicle's infrared signature. These features are particularly advantageous for long-range military operations that require low observability. The approach is demonstrated using the DLR's Generic Hypersonic Glide Vehicle 2 (GHGV-2) simulation model. The results confirm the method's effectiveness in maintaining control authority under realistic, constrained flight conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08275","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.285458","language":"en","tags":["cssy","computer-science","eesssy","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Johannes Autenrieb, Patrick Gruhn","raw_content_length":1262,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HGV"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1261,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Control Allocation Algorithm","Hypersonic Glide Vehicles","Input Limitations","new Abstract","Hypersonic glide vehicles","HGVs","challenging flight regimes","strong nonlinearities","actuation","stringent physical constraints"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A Control Allocation Algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Control Allocation Algorithm":2.0,"Hypersonic Glide Vehicles":2.0,"Input Limitations":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Hypersonic glide vehicles":1.0,"HGVs":1.0,"challenging flight regimes":1.0,"strong nonlinearities":1.0,"actuation":1.0,"stringent physical constraints":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7750205380555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9009,"joy":0.0115,"surprise":0.0541,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0103,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper presents an algorithm that aims to reduce drag and surface temperatures in hypersonic glide vehicles, which indirectly improves energy efficiency.

We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA.

Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08279","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.286642","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","cscv","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Michael Niemeyer, Fabian Manhardt, Marie-Julie Rakotosaona, Michael Oechsle, Christina Tsalicoglou, Keisuke Tateno, Jonathan T.

However, LLMs exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons. These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer practical guidance for model training and engineering.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_78d916d35503","title":"Dynamic Connectivity with Expected Polylogarithmic Worst","content":"arXiv:2510.08297v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Whether a graph $G=(V,E)$ is connected is arguably its most fundamental property. Naturally, connectivity was the first characteristic studied for dynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that undergo edge insertions and deletions. While connectivity algorithms with polylogarithmic amortized update time have been known since the 90s, achieving worst-case guarantees has proven more elusive. Two recent breakthroughs have made important progress on this question: (1) Kapron, King and Mountjoy [SODA'13; Best Paper] gave a Monte-Carlo algorithm with polylogarithmic worst-case update time, and (2) Nanongkai, Saranurak and Wulff-Nilsen [STOC'17, FOCS'17] obtained a Las-Vegas data structure, however, with subpolynomial worst-case update time. Their algorithm was subsequently de-randomized [FOCS'20]. In this article, we present a new dynamic connectivity algorithm based on the popular core graph framework that maintains a hierarchy interleaving vertex and edge sparsification. Previous dynamic implementations of the core graph framework required subpolynomial update time.

When taking into account uncertainties, the search space is very difficult to explore, even for experienced engineers. Moreover, it should be taken into account that while some decisions are fixed at the design stage, other parameters can be adapted to the realization of the uncertainty during the operation of the plant. This leads to a two-stage optimization problem which is difficult to solve. To address this challenge, we propose to combine commercial process simulation software with an evolutionary strategy. This approach is applied to designing a downstream process to isolate valuable products from pyrolysis oil produced by the catalytic pyrolysis of rigid polyurethane foam. The suggested algorithm consistently performed better than a manually designed robust process. Additionally, the analysis of different scenarios provided insight into promising changes in the overall layout of the recycling process.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08301","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.290130","language":"en","tags":["research","csce","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Patrick Lotz, Luca Bosetti, Andr\\'e Bardow, Sergio Lucia, Sebastian Engell","raw_content_length":1086,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1085,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Design","chemical recycling processes","PUR foam","uncertainty","arXiv251008301v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Optimization problems","chemical process design","a significant number","discrete and continuous decisions"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Design"],"ai_ml":["uncertainty"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Design":2.0,"chemical recycling processes":2.0,"PUR foam":2.0,"uncertainty":2.0,"arXiv251008301v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Optimization problems":1.0,"chemical process design":1.0,"a significant number":1.0,"discrete and continuous decisions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7751938066666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.5995,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6801,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.746,"joy":0.0084,"surprise":0.0188,"sadness":0.0105,"fear":0.1914,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0114},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the design and optimization of a chemical recycling process for polyurethane foam using process simulation software and an evolutionary strategy.

To address this growing need for flexible learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance (DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network use-cases.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08303","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.290545","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csni","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Yannis Belkhiter, Seshu Tirupathi, Giulio Zizzo, Merim Dzaferagic, John D.

The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with all the other queries to directly encode the global context information. Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring video segmentation benchmarks.

However, the contribution of reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps. We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08308","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.291367","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Liwei Kang, Yue Deng, Yao Xiao, Zhanfeng Mo, Wee Sun Lee, Lidong Bing","raw_content_length":1570,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["First Try Matters: Revisiting the Role of Reflection in Reasoning Models arXiv:2510.08308v1","SFT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1569,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["First Try Matters","the Role","Reflection","Reasoning Models","arXiv251008308v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language models","significant gains","reasoning ability","their capacity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"First Try Matters":2.0,"the Role":2.0,"Reflection":2.0,"Reasoning Models":2.0,"arXiv251008308v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"significant gains":1.0,"reasoning ability":1.0,"their capacity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7752376591666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.200999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8402,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8585,"joy":0.029,"surprise":0.0751,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.0187,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article focuses on improving the efficiency of large language models, specifically in reasoning tasks.

A popular approach, Learning to Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08314","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.292153","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Andrea Pugnana, Giovanni De Toni, Cesare Barbera, Roberto Pellungrini, Bruno Lepri, Andrea Passerini","raw_content_length":1204,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Learning to Defer (LtD","LtA","Machine Learning","Learning to Ask ("],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1203,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Human Feedback","arXiv251008314v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","decision-support systems","human performance","classification tasks","an open challenge","A popular approach","Defer LtD"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Human Feedback":2.0,"arXiv251008314v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"decision-support systems":1.0,"human performance":1.0,"classification tasks":1.0,"an open challenge":1.0,"A popular approach":1.0,"Defer LtD":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775268186111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9348,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0243,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0071,"anger":0.0146,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new framework (LtA) for human-AI collaboration in classification tasks.

While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08316","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.292561","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Yu Huang, Zelin Peng, Changsong Wen, Xiaokang Yang, Wei Shen","raw_content_length":1410,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["2D Vision Foundation Models","CMAT","Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer ("],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1409,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Unlocking 3D Affordance Segmentation","2D Semantic Knowledge","arXiv251008316v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Affordance segmentation","3D objects","functionally distinct parts","applications","robotic manipulation","recent studies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Unlocking 3D Affordance Segmentation":2.0,"2D Semantic Knowledge":2.0,"arXiv251008316v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Affordance segmentation":1.0,"3D objects":1.0,"functionally distinct parts":1.0,"applications":1.0,"robotic manipulation":1.0,"recent studies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7752829938888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9074,"joy":0.0051,"surprise":0.0139,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0268,"anger":0.0222,"disgust":0.0201},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to 3D affordance segmentation using 2D semantic knowledge.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f16c14d5e2f2","title":"LinVideo: A Post","content":"arXiv:2510.08318v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08318","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.292955","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Yushi Huang, Xingtong Ge, Ruihao Gong, Chengtao Lv, Jun Zhang","raw_content_length":1553,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear attention","LinVideo"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1552,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LinVideo","A Post","linear attention","arXiv251008318v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Video diffusion models","DMs","high-quality video synthesis","their computation costs","sequence length"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LinVideo":2.0,"A Post":2.0,"linear attention":2.0,"arXiv251008318v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Video diffusion models":1.0,"DMs":1.0,"high-quality video synthesis":1.0,"their computation costs":1.0,"sequence length":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775296861388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8881,"joy":0.0221,"surprise":0.0439,"sadness":0.0211,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0117,"disgust":0.0081},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The research presents a method (LinVideo) to improve the efficiency of video diffusion models, potentially reducing the computational resources needed for video synthesis.
