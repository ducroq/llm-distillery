{"id":"science_biorxiv_b38834fac2f2","title":"Coordinated and compartmentalized functions of CAII and CAIV establish a dual pH","content":"The intracellular carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and GPI-anchored extracellular carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) are distinctly compartmentalized enzymes that regulate bicarbonate (HCO3-) and acid-base homeostasis. Located in the epithelial cells of the epididymis, vas deferens, and on spermatozoa, these enzymes are positioned to regulate the pH environment critical for sperm maturation and capacitation, crucial for male reproduction. This regulation is essential for early sperm activation, as bicarbonate (HCO3-) triggers the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC)/cAMP signaling pathways and leads to an increase in intracellular pH (pHi), a prerequisite for motility. However, the specific contributions of CAII and CAIV to luminal pH and to sperm pHi regulation remain unclear. Here, we show that genetic ablation of either CAII or CAIV in mice results in a loss of normal luminal acidification in the male reproductive tract but, paradoxically, also lowers the basal pHi of sperm. This lower basal pHi reduces the effectiveness of subsequent intracellular alkalinization, thereby diminishing the activation of pH-sensitive sperm CatSper Ca2+ channels essential for capacitation and male fertility. We further establish a direct link between CAIV and the Slo3 K+ channel, as Slo3-deficient sperm exhibit reduced pHi and decreased CAIV protein levels. In contrast, sperm lacking the CatSper Ca2+ channel show no change in CAII, CAIV, or pHi. Super-resolution imaging reveals that CAII is located within the flagellum near the CatSper channel in the principal piece, while CAIV is distributed along the entire flagellar membrane. Our study demonstrates that CAII and CAIV employ coordinated and spatially distinct mechanisms to regulate pH. By maintaining an acidic luminal environment for sperm maturation and triggering the subsequent alkalinization of sperm pHi, these enzymes modulate ion channel activity, thereby regulating sperm motility and fertility.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681600v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:53:49.565922","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":280,"author":"Wiesehoefer, C., Gardner, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_3b13f8e4574d","title":"Homologous recombination mutant lethality differs between h","content":"Homologous recombination (HR) is generally considered dispensable in yeast and vertebrates, yet mounting evidence indicates that its essentiality depends on cellular context. Here, we dissect the basis of this context dependency in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In the homothallic h90 strain, regarded as wild type, mating-type switching (MTS) occurs every other cell division and requires HR to repair programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the mat1 locus. We show that the widely used heterothallic h-S strain is likewise dependent on HR for viability. HR-deficient h-S mutants (rad51{Delta}, rad52{Delta}, or rad54{Delta}), still frequently employed in the literature, survive only when carrying secondary suppressor mutations that abolish mat1 DSB formation, such as smt-0, swi1{Delta}, or fml1{Delta}. In contrast, HR is dispensable in the h+N strain, where duplication of the mat2/3 region into mat1 introduces the cenH and REIII elements. These elements nucleate H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin spreading across the imprint site, blocking imprintosome recruitment and thereby preventing both imprinting and DSB formation. Disruption of this heterochromatin, via deletion of cenH or key chromatin modifiers, restores DSB formation in h+N cells and reinstates HR essentiality in the absence of the Clr4 methyltransferase. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that HR is indispensable for S. pombe survival due to its critical role in repairing mat1 DSBs, except under genetic or epigenetic conditions that suppress their formation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682094v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:53:49.566340","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Kolesar, P., Paliavoi, S., Stefanovie, B., Palecek, J.

In humans, conventional type I dendritic cells (cDC1s) myeloid dendritic cell subset that express BDCA-3 (CD141). CDC1s promote CD8+ T cell cross-priming against tumor antigens and are therefore being explored for use in immunotherapy. We evaluated the impact of ex-vivo stimulation on human peripheral blood cDC1s. In contrast to routine evaluation, which focuses on pre-defined surface maturation markers or soluble factors released from the activated cells, we investigated the impact of stimulation on the transcriptome using both RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays. Specifically, we analyzed the mRNA of cDC1 upon activation with two clinical-grade adjuvants, Hiltonol (poly IC, a TLR3 ligand) and protamine-stabilized RNA (pRNA, a TLR7/8 ligand) compared to unstimulated controls. Both RNA-seq and microarray analysis showed profound and similar effects of both Hiltonol and pRNA on the transcriptome of cDC1s. A gene ontology analysis suggested that these changes were mainly related to activation and maturation pathways, including induction of type-I interferon and interleukin-12 transcription, while pathways related to adverse effects or cell damage did not appear to be affected. Combination of both reagents did not appear to have a synergistic effect, as the transcriptome changes were similar to those induced by each stimulus alone. Together, our results indicate that both adjuvants have comparable effects on cDC1 maturation within an immunogenic short-term culture as performed in immunotherapy.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682171v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:53:49.566639","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Florez Grau, G., Mathan, T., Mihaylova, M., van Oorschot, T., Schreibelt, G., Sancho, D., Melero, I., Figdor, C.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_7d9a0f5d6202","title":"GS-Verse: Mesh","content":"arXiv:2510.11878v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce \\our{} (\\textbf{G}aussian \\textbf{S}platting for \\textbf{V}irtual \\textbf{E}nvironment \\textbf{R}endering and \\textbf{S}cene \\textbf{E}diting), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \\our{} facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11878","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.239257","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","csgr","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Anastasiya Pechko, Piotr Borycki, Joanna Waczy\\'nska, Daniel Barczyk, Agata Szyma\\'nska, S{\\l}awomir Tadeja, Przemys{\\l}aw Spurek","raw_content_length":1849,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Virtual Reality"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1848,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["GS-Verse","Mesh","arXiv251011878v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the demand","immersive 3D content","the need","intuitive and efficient interaction methods","Current techniques","physically manipulating 3D content"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"GS-Verse":2.0,"Mesh":2.0,"arXiv251011878v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the demand":1.0,"immersive 3D content":1.0,"the need":1.0,"intuitive and efficient interaction methods":1.0,"Current techniques":1.0,"physically manipulating 3D content":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7375958983333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8703,"joy":0.0126,"surprise":0.0367,"sadness":0.0149,"fear":0.0341,"anger":0.0214,"disgust":0.0099},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel method for manipulating 3D content in VR using Gaussian Splatting.
