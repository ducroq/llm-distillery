{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0cf8626da0d6","title":"Mini","content":"arXiv:2408.02839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used to optimize deep Cox neural network (Cox-NN) by updating model parameters using mini-batches of data. We show that SGD aims to optimize the average of mini-batch partial-likelihood, which is different from the standard partial-likelihood. This distinction requires developing new statistical properties for the global optimizer, namely, the mini-batch maximum partial-likelihood estimator (mb-MPLE). We establish that mb-MPLE for Cox-NN is consistent and achieves the optimal minimax convergence rate up to a polylogarithmic factor. For Cox regression with linear covariate effects, we further show that mb-MPLE is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal with asymptotic variance approaching the information lower bound as batch size increases, which is confirmed by simulation studies. Additionally, we offer practical guidance on using SGD, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical evidence. For Cox-NN, we demonstrate that the ratio of the learning rate to the batch size is critical in SGD dynamics, offering insight into hyperparameter tuning. For Cox regression, we characterize the iterative convergence of SGD, ensuring that the global optimizer, mb-MPLE, can be approximated with sufficiently many iterations. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mb-MPLE in a large-scale real-world application where the standard MPLE is intractable.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02839","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.966868","language":"en","tags":["statml","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Lang Zeng, Weijing Tang, Zhao Ren, Ying Ding","raw_content_length":1494,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mini arXiv:2408.02839v2 Announce Type","SGD) algorithm","SGD","Cox-NN"],"persons":["Cox"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1493,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mini","SGD","replace-cross Abstract","The stochastic gradient descent","algorithm","deep Cox neural network","Cox-NN","model parameters","mini","batches"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mini":2.0,"SGD":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The stochastic gradient descent":1.0,"algorithm":1.0,"deep Cox neural network":1.0,"Cox-NN":1.0,"model parameters":1.0,"mini":1.0,"batches":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7751013975,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.18,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.836,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9134,"joy":0.0178,"surprise":0.0298,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0078,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.0106},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for Cox neural networks, which could indirectly improve the efficiency of models used in various sustainability applications.

Although interest has grown since 1970, evidence remains dispersed across designs and populations.MethodsFollowing the PEO (population, exposure, outcome) framework and PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Of 1,332 records identified, we screened empirical studies of students engaged in formal or informal music learning that reported self-esteem outcomes. We extracted trends, methods, measurement tools, and results, and appraised methodological quality.ResultsTwenty-two studies met inclusion criteria (18 quantitative; 4 mixed-methods), with a predominance of cross-sectional designs. Quantitative studies showed stronger methodological quality (mean, x̅ = 0.79), whereas qualitative components of mixed-methods studies were lower (x̅ = 0.43). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was the most widely used instrument. Across studies, self-esteem in music education was associated with demographic factors (e.g., gender, age) and psychological factors (e.g., self-efficacy). Overall, music learning was linked to enhanced self-esteem among children and adolescents, with notable benefits for specific student groups.DiscussionCurrent evidence indicates a positive relationship between music education and students’ self-esteem; however, generalizability is limited by the dominance of cross-sectional designs and uneven methodological quality. Future research should employ broader designs (e.g., longitudinal and experimental), include more diverse populations, and use consistent, validated measures to strengthen causal inference and applicability.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1515305","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:20.872749","language":"en","tags":["systematic_review","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Yanli Tong","raw_content_length":1715,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PEO","ResultsTwenty","Scopus","EBSCO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1715,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Student self","students","IntroductionThis systematic literature review","music education"," self-esteem","interest","evidence","designs","populations","population"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Student self":2.0,"students":2.0,"IntroductionThis systematic literature review":1.0,"music education":1.0," self-esteem":1.0,"interest":1.0,"evidence":1.0,"designs":1.0,"populations":1.0,"population":1.0}},"age_hours":6.779754915,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.453999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6908,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.897,"joy":0.0138,"surprise":0.0305,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0116,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.0237},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is a systematic literature review about the relationship between music education and self-esteem.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_88a165aac6df","title":"The relationships between anxiety, psychotic","content":"IntroductionResearch has suggested that anxiety may be responsible for the elevated levels of psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) seen in Autism. However, there has been no previous systematic review examining this relationship.MethodWe conducted three separate searches of PubMed and Ovid (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Global Health and EMBASE) until 31st June 2024 for articles reporting on the association between anxiety, Autism and PLEs. A total of 54 articles were reviewed, including research exploring the links between anxiety and PLEs (28 studies), Autism and PLEs (12 studies), Autism and anxiety (14 systematic reviews and meta-analyses).ResultsStudies of Anxiety and PLEs: Thirteen reported a significant positive correlation, and ten studies indicated that individuals with anxiety were more likely to experience PLEs. Studies of Autism and PLEs: Seven identified a significant positive correlation, with three longitudinal studies reporting that autistic traits predicted PLEs. Studies of Autism and Anxiety: Seven reviews revealed increased prevalence rates of anxiety disorders among autistic individuals, while 9 identified potential mediators of this relationship, such as intolerance of uncertainty and IQ.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the association of PLEs with Autism and anxiety disorders, suggesting that co-occurring Autism and anxiety may represent an at-risk group for psychosis. Such insights have important implications for psychosis prevention, indicating that anxiety intervention in autistic populations may reduce PLE incidence. However, application of these findings to autistic individuals is significantly limited by the lack of included studies utilizing clinical populations. Future research is needed to establish the causal role of anxiety in this relationship, particularly using clinical adult samples.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024555930.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1549886","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:20.874201","language":"en","tags":["systematic_review","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Raka Maitra","raw_content_length":1928,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EMBASE","PubMed","Global Health","IntroductionResearch"],"persons":["Ovid"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1928,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["anxiety","The relationships","PLEs","Autism","IntroductionResearch","the elevated levels","psychotic-like experiences","no previous systematic review","this relationship","MethodWe"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["IntroductionResearch"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"anxiety":4.0,"The relationships":2.0,"PLEs":2.0,"Autism":2.0,"IntroductionResearch":1.0,"the elevated levels":1.0,"psychotic-like experiences":1.0,"no previous systematic review":1.0,"this relationship":1.0,"MethodWe":1.0}},"age_hours":6.779815923611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.706,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4588,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0876,"joy":0.0028,"surprise":0.0155,"sadness":0.0136,"fear":0.8624,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0076},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is a systematic review of existing research on the relationship between anxiety, autism, and psychotic-like experiences.

Social robots have emerged as promising tools to enhance companionship, cognitive engagement, and daily assistance. However, fear of robots among older adults remains a critical barrier to adoption.ObjectiveThis scoping review examined how fear manifests in human-robot interaction (HRI), what factors contribute to these reactions, and how they influence technology acceptance.MethodsA systematic search of six major databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) identified studies published between January 2014 and March 2025. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, 49 studies were included, encompassing 6,670 older participants across 16 countries.ResultsThematic synthesis revealed seven main fear categories: privacy and autonomy concerns, trust and reliability issues, emotional and ethical discomfort, usability challenges, fear of dependence, unfamiliarity with technology, and the Uncanny Valley effect. Fear levels were shaped by robot design, cultural background, prior technology experience, and contextual factors such as care settings. Mitigation strategies, including co-design with older adults, gradual exposure, transparent system behavior, and emotionally congruent interaction, were associated with improved acceptance.ConclusionsThis review uniquely maps fear typologies to robot functions and intervention strategies, offering a framework to guide emotionally adaptive and culturally sensitive robot design. Addressing emotional barriers is essential for the ethical and effective integration of social robots into eldercare.

This transforms the nature of play, making it more interactive and adaptive. For individuals with cognitive or physical impairments, robots can serve as predictable and engaging companions that attract attention, foster motivation, and facilitate social interaction in group settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to support the design of play-oriented robots and activities. Drawing on more than 20 years of research and development, we provide examples of low-cost robotic systems tailored for diverse user needs, including both typically developing individuals and those with disabilities.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_bace7ccf6a50","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9039: Demand Segmentation for Sustainable Adventure Destination Management: A Study of Santa Elena, Ecuador","content":"Adventure tourism has established itself as a growing sector that integrates physical activity, interaction with nature, and cultural exchange. Understanding the heterogeneity of demand is crucial for designing effective and sustainable destination management strategies. Despite the global growth of adventure tourism, there is a scarcity of empirical studies analyzing the motivations, segmentation, and loyalty of tourists in emerging coastal destinations. This study contributes to filling this gap by providing evidence from the case of Santa Elena, Ecuador. This study examines the motivations, market segmentation, and loyalty of adventure tourists in Santa Elena, an emerging coastal destination in Ecuador. Based on a survey of 318 visitors and using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and k-means cluster segmentation, five motivational dimensions were identified: learning, social, biosecurity, relaxation, and competence-mastery. The results revealed two distinct segments: (i) Relaxation seekers, primarily motivated by rest and stress reduction, and (ii) multi-motivation tourists, with high levels of motivation across all dimensions.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), students entering engineering programs often exhibit significant apprehension toward foundational sciences, creating barriers to developing the technical competencies required for sustainable development. This paper introduces the AI-Integrated Practical Learning in Engineering (AIPLE) Framework, an innovative pedagogical model that synergizes Problem-Based Learning (PBL), hands-on experimentation, and strategic Artificial Intelligence (AI) integration to transform engineering education for sustainability. The AIPLE framework employs a five-stage cyclical process designed to address student apprehension while fostering sustainable engineering mindsets essential for achieving SDGs 4 (Quality Education), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). This study, grounded in qualitative surveys of engineering instructors at Université Loyola du Congo (ULC), demonstrates how the framework addresses pedagogical limitations while building technical competency and sustainability consciousness. The research reveals that traditional didactic methods inadequately prepare students for complex sustainability challenges, while the AIPLE framework’s integration of AI-assisted learning, practical problem-solving, and sustainability-focused projects offers a scalable solution for engineering education transformation in resource-constrained environments. Our findings indicate strong instructor support for PBL methodologies and cautious optimism regarding AI integration, with emphasis on addressing infrastructure and ethical considerations. The AIPLE framework contributes to sustainable development by preparing engineers who are technically competent and committed to creating environmentally responsible, socially inclusive, and economically viable solutions for developing countries.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9038","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:25.088023","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Anderson Sunda-Meya","raw_content_length":2102,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AI-Integrated Practical Learning","Problem-Based Learning","the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","Artificial Intelligence (AI","Affordable and Clean Energy","AI Engineering"],"persons":[],"locations":["the Democratic Republic of Congo"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2081,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pages","Engineering education","developing countries","critical challenges","progress","the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","SDGs","the Democratic Republic","Congo","DRC"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"],"engineering":["the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pages":2.0,"Engineering education":1.0,"developing countries":1.0,"critical challenges":1.0,"progress":1.0,"the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals":1.0,"SDGs":1.0,"the Democratic Republic":1.0,"Congo":1.0,"DRC":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7798808430555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0206,"joy":0.0025,"surprise":0.0031,"sadness":0.0025,"fear":0.9646,"anger":0.0034,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a pedagogical framework (AIPLE) integrating AI into engineering education in the DRC.

We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08652","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.898434","language":"en","tags":["research","mathnt","preprints","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Mario M.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_e4d773671111","title":"Theoretical guarantees for change localization using conformal p","content":"arXiv:2510.08749v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Changepoint localization aims to provide confidence sets for a changepoint (if one exists). Existing methods either relying on strong parametric assumptions or providing only asymptotic guarantees or focusing on a particular kind of change(e.g., change in the mean) rather than the entire distributional change. A method (possibly the first) to achieve distribution-free changepoint localization with finite-sample validity was recently introduced by \\cite{dandapanthula2025conformal}. However, while they proved finite sample coverage, there was no analysis of set size. In this work, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for their algorithm. We also show the consistency of a point estimator for change, and derive its convergence rate without distributional assumptions. Along that line, we also construct a distribution-free consistent test to assess whether a particular time point is a changepoint or not. Thus, our work provides unified distribution-free guarantees for changepoint detection, localization, and testing. In addition, we present various finite sample and asymptotic properties of the conformal $p$-value in the distribution change setup, which provides a theoretical foundation for many applications of the conformal $p$-value. As an application of these properties, we construct distribution-free consistent tests for exchangeability against distribution-change alternatives and a new, computationally tractable method of optimizing the powers of conformal tests. We run detailed simulation studies to corroborate the performance of our methods and theoretical results. Together, our contributions offer a comprehensive and theoretically principled approach to distribution-free changepoint inference, broadening both the scope and credibility of conformal methods in modern changepoint analysis.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08749","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.901776","language":"en","tags":["statml","statme","research","preprints","mathematics","mathst","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Swapnaneel Bhattacharyya, Aaditya Ramdas","raw_content_length":1874,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["arXiv:2510.08749v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1873,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Theoretical guarantees","change localization","conformal p","new Abstract","Changepoint localization","confidence sets","a changepoint","Existing methods","strong parametric assumptions","only asymptotic guarantees"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Theoretical guarantees":2.0,"change localization":2.0,"conformal p":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Changepoint localization":1.0,"confidence sets":1.0,"a changepoint":1.0,"Existing methods":1.0,"strong parametric assumptions":1.0,"only asymptotic guarantees":1.0}},"age_hours":2.781487273888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8531,"joy":0.0648,"surprise":0.0378,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.025,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical advancement in changepoint detection, providing a distribution-free method with finite-sample validity.

We apply GA-NGMRES to a preconditioned first-order optimization scheme by interpreting the update rule as a fixed-point (FP) iteration. Our approach introduces a novel periodic mixing strategy that integrates NGMRES updates with FP steps. This new scheme improves efficiency in terms of both iteration count and runtime compared to the state-of-the-art. We include a comparison to first-order preconditioned gradient descent and preconditioned, inexact Gauss--Newton--Krylov methods. Since the proposed optimization scheme only relies on first-order derivative information, its implementation is straightforward. We evaluate performance as a function of hyperparameters, the mesh size, and the regularization parameter. We consider advection, incompressible flows, and mass-preserving transport (i.e., optimal transport-type problems) as PDE models. Stipulating adequate smoothness requirements based on variational regularization of the control variable ensures that the computed transport maps are diffeomorphic. Numerical experiments on real-world and synthetic problems highlight the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach yields runtimes that are up to 5x faster than state-of-the-art Newton--Krylov methods, without sacrificing accuracy.

This problem arises in critical infrastructure systems such as power distribution, water networks, and gas distribution, where radial configurations are essential for operational safety and efficiency. Optimal solution for this problem is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we prove further that constructing a feasible radial distribution configuration is weakly NP-complete, making exact solution methods computationally intractable for large-scale networks. We propose FORWARD (Feasibility Oriented Random-Walk Inspired Algorithm for Radial Reconfiguration in Distribution Networks), a polynomial-time algorithm that leverages graph-theoretic decomposition and random walk principles to construct feasible radial configurations. Our approach introduces novel techniques including strategic graph partitioning at articulation points, dual graph condensation to address greedy shortsightedness, and capacity-aware edge swapping for infeasibility resolution. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis proving feasibility guarantees and establish a compositional framework enabling parallel processing while preserving optimality properties. Comprehensive numerical evaluation on networks ranging from IEEE standard test systems to 400-node small-world networks demonstrates that FORWARD consistently outperforms commercial MINLP solvers, achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions in seconds where traditional methods require hours or fail entirely. The algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and scalability make it particularly suitable for real-time distribution network management and as an effective initialization strategy for iterative optimization solvers.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08785","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.903577","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathoc","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Joan Vendrell Gallart, Russell Bent, Solmaz Kia","raw_content_length":1950,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1949,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FORWARD","A Feasible Radial Reconfiguration Algorithm","Multi","arXiv251008785v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","an optimal radial reconfiguration problem","multi-source distribution networks","the goal","a radial configuration"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A Feasible Radial Reconfiguration Algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FORWARD":2.0,"A Feasible Radial Reconfiguration Algorithm":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251008785v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"an optimal radial reconfiguration problem":1.0,"multi-source distribution networks":1.0,"the goal":1.0,"a radial configuration":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7815409341666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.2695,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5461,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9172,"joy":0.0284,"surprise":0.0252,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0079,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper presents a novel algorithm (FORWARD) for optimizing radial reconfiguration in distribution networks, which can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

In this paper, we seek to characterize those manifolds for which such an exact relationship holds, and more generally measure the discrepancy of such a relationship holding in terms of geometric data. To this end, we obtain a stability estimate which shows that, for a smoothly bounded domain in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, if the commutator $[\\Lambda,\\Delta_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}]$ is small then that domain is itself close to a ball. We then study the case of manifolds conformal to the ball, show that a relationship as above implies a radial metric structure, and discuss stability in this setting.

Despite this equivalence, one may find in the literature only some preliminary results on the relationship among Latin squares and LPPs. This paper delves into this topic by showing how the coefficients of any LPP are identified with the zeros of an algebraic set over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This allows for an algebraic description of all Latin squares of order $q$ by means of a unique polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$, whose coefficients satisfy the constraints defined by the algebraic set under consideration. In order to make much easier the construction of this polynomial, we also deal with the natural translation to LPPs of both notions of reduced and isotopic Latin squares. Our algebraic approach is readily adapted to identify both types of Latin squares. All of the above is constructively illustrated for $q\\in\\{4,5\\}$. We finish our study with the natural translation to LPPs of both notions of complete mappings and orthomorphisms of quasigroups, showing their relationship with transversals and isotopisms of Latin squares.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09086","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.918758","language":"en","tags":["mathag","research","preprints","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Ra\\'ul M.

Thereby solving the problem exactly in polynomial time. Our analysis identifies structural properties of the input data that influence the integrality of the relaxation. We show that incorporating ordered components introduces additional layers of combinatorial complexity that invalidate the exactness observed in classical (non-ordered) settings. In particular, for certain ordered problems such as the min--max case, the linear relaxation never recovers the integral solution. These results clarify the intrinsic hardness introduced by sorting and reveal that the strength of the relaxation depends critically on the ``proximity'' of the ordered problem to its classical counterpart: problems closer to the non-ordered case tend to admit tighter relaxations, while those further away exhibit substantially weaker behavior. Computational experiments on benchmark instances confirm the predictive value of the integrality conditions and demonstrate the practical implications of exact relaxations for ordered location problems.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09166","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.921118","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathoc","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"V\\'ictor Blanco, Diego Laborda, Miguel Mart\\'inez-Ant\\'on","raw_content_length":1302,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["max"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1301,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Strength","Linear Relaxations","Ordered Optimization","arXiv251009166v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the conditions","which","the convex relaxation","a mixed-integer linear programming formulation","ordered optimization problems"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["a mixed-integer linear programming formulation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Strength":2.0,"Linear Relaxations":2.0,"Ordered Optimization":2.0,"arXiv251009166v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the conditions":1.0,"which":1.0,"the convex relaxation":1.0,"a mixed-integer linear programming formulation":1.0,"ordered optimization problems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.782159776944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.734,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9468,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6586,"joy":0.1907,"surprise":0.0917,"sadness":0.012,"fear":0.0098,"anger":0.03,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the mathematical properties of optimization problems related to sorting, which can have indirect impacts on sustainability by improving the efficiency of resource allocation.

In this paper, we give a further study on averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras and special apre-perm bialgebras. A solution of the averaging associative Yang-Baxter equation whose symmetric part is invariant gives rise to an averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebra that is called quasi-triangular, and such solutions can be equivalently characterized as $\\mathcal{O}$-operators of admissible averaging commutative algebras with weights. Moreover assuming the symmetric parts of such solutions to be zero or nondegenerate, we obtain typical subclasses of quasi-triangular averaging commutative and cocommutative infinitesimal bialgebras, namely the triangular and factorizable ones respectively. Both of them are shown to closely relate to symmetric averaging Rota-Baxter Frobenius commutative algebras. There is a parallel procedure developed for special apre-perm bialgebras.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_410776aadd97","title":"A Morphology","content":"arXiv:2510.09213v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation poses significant challenges, particularly when sources exhibit complex or discontinuous geometries. Traditional numerical methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while machine learning-based approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Random Feature Method (RFM) -- though computationally efficient for inverse problems -- lack the intrinsic machinery to handle the sharp morphological features in such singular problems, leading to inaccurate solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Morphology-Adaptive Random Feature Method (MA-RFM), a novel two-phase framework that adaptively locates critical regions and adds morphology activation functions for tackling the multi-frequency inverse source problem with complex geometry. Our framework recasts the ill-posed inverse problem into a well-posed, strictly convex optimization problem by reformulating the governing Helmholtz equation as a Tikhonov-regularized integral equation via its fundamental solution. In the first stage, the Integral Adaptive RFM (IA-RFM), employs an adaptive algorithm to rapidly localize the source support, thereby reducing computational overhead and accelerating convergence. In the second stage, posterior geometric information is progressively integrated into the solver via hybrid basis functions, enabling a precise reconstruction of complex morphologies. The MA-RFM extends the capabilities of RFM to handle PDEs with singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free efficiency. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through ample challenging 2D and 3D benchmark problems, even under limited and noisy measurement conditions, highlighting its robustness and accuracy in reconstructing complex and disjoint sources.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09213","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.925116","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","mathematics","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Xinwei Hu, Jingrun Chen, Haijun Yu","raw_content_length":1867,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RFM","Helmholtz","MA-RFM","Physics-Informed Neural Networks","the Morphology-Adaptive Random Feature Method","the Random Feature Method"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1864,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Morphology","arXiv251009213v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The inverse source problem","the Helmholtz equation","significant challenges","sources","complex or discontinuous geometries","Traditional numerical methods","prohibitive computational costs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Morphology":2.0,"arXiv251009213v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The inverse source problem":1.0,"the Helmholtz equation":1.0,"significant challenges":1.0,"sources":1.0,"complex or discontinuous geometries":1.0,"Traditional numerical methods":1.0,"prohibitive computational costs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.782309805277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2850000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.743,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7505,"joy":0.0172,"surprise":0.0515,"sadness":0.0842,"fear":0.0484,"anger":0.0241,"disgust":0.0242},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (MA-RFM) for solving the inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation, which could potentially be applied to various fields, including environmental monitoring and resource exploration.

We explore how structural knowledge about the data-generating process which gives rise to the distribution can be used to overcome this curse. More precisely, we work with the set of distributions of probabilistic graphical models for a known directed acyclic graph. It turns out that this knowledge is only helpful if it can be quantified, which we formalize via smoothness conditions on the transition kernels in the disintegration corresponding to the graph. In this case, we prove that the rate of estimation is governed by the local structure of the graph, more precisely by dimensions corresponding to single nodes together with their parent nodes. The precise rate depends on the exact notion of smoothness assumed for the kernels, where either weak (Wasserstein-Lipschitz) or strong (bidirectional Total-Variation-Lipschitz) conditions lead to different results. We prove sharpness under the strong condition and show that this condition is satisfied for example for distributions having a positive Lipschitz density.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09270","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.928917","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathematics","mathpr","mathst","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Daniel Bartl, Stephan Eckstein","raw_content_length":1218,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Wasserstein","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1217,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["probabilistic graphical models","Fast Wasserstein rates","probability distributions","arXiv251009270v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","iid data","a high-dimensional distribution","Wasserstein distance","a fundamental instance","the curse"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"probabilistic graphical models":3.0,"Fast Wasserstein rates":2.0,"probability distributions":2.0,"arXiv251009270v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"iid data":1.0,"a high-dimensional distribution":1.0,"Wasserstein distance":1.0,"a fundamental instance":1.0,"the curse":1.0}},"age_hours":2.782445127777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.882,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8236,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8352,"joy":0.0295,"surprise":0.0424,"sadness":0.0235,"fear":0.0124,"anger":0.0243,"disgust":0.0326},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the estimation of probability distributions in probabilistic graphical models, which could potentially be applied to climate modeling and prediction.

Similarly, it is not known if local spectral properties such as the single valued extension property, Dunfords property $(C)$, Bishops property $(\\beta)$, or the decomposition property ($\\delta$) are preserved under sums and products of commuting operators. But it is shown by Bourhim and Muller that the single-valued extension property is not preserved under the sums and products of commuting operators. On the positive side, Sun proved that the sum and the product of two commuting operators with Dunfords property $(C)$ have the single-valued extension property. Very recently, Aiena and Muller showed that the (localized) single-valued extension property is stable under commuting Riesz perturbations.

In relation to that, we study generalized Bishop frames of regular time-like curves. In a previous work, we showed that there is a hierarchy among different types of generalized Bishop frames for regular curves in the Euclidean space. Building upon this study, we further investigate it in the 4-dimensional Lorentz space $\\mathbb{L}^4$. There are four types of generalized Bishop frames of regular time-like curves in $\\mathbb{L}^{4}$ up to the change of the order of vectors fixing the first one which is the tangent vector. Unlike other types of curves, such as light-like and space-like ones, the time-like curve can be investigated in a manner analogous to the Euclidean case.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_c9c66f227cbc","title":"What Are We Clustering For? Establishing Performance Guarantees for Time Series Aggregation in Generation Expansion Planning","content":"arXiv:2510.09357v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Generation expansion planning (GEP) is a prominent example of capacity expansion problems in operations research. Being generally NP-hard, GEP optimization models can become intractable when nonconvex dynamics, time-coupling constraints, and complex asset interactions are involved. Time series aggregation (TSA) tackles this by reducing temporal complexity via input data clustering. However, existing TSA methods either focus solely on preserving the statistical features of the input data, yielding heuristics without guarantees on the aggregated model's accuracy, or provide error bounds limited to linear models, neglecting time-coupling constraints and applying only to specific clustering techniques. Moreover, these bounds typically pertain solely to the GEP objective function and do not extend to other stakeholder-specific metrics, such as decision vector partitions. To tackle these issues, we demonstrate that an appropriately constructed aggregated model always provides a lower bound on the optimal objective function value of the full-scale GEP model in both mixed-integer linear and mixed-integer quadratic formulations with time-coupling, independent of the clustering technique employed. Building on this, we propose a performance-guaranteed TSA-based solution algorithm that iteratively refines objective function bounds while generating feasible solutions to the full-scale model at each iteration. We then discuss a comparison with Benders decomposition and demonstrate how the derived bounds can be extended to error estimates for stakeholder-specific metrics. Numerical results show the computational advantages of our method over both full-scale optimization and classical Benders decomposition.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09357","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.936640","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathoc","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Luca Santosuosso, Bettina Klinz, Sonja Wogrin","raw_content_length":1769,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear","GEP","TSA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1768,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["What","Performance Guarantees","Time Series Aggregation","Generation Expansion Planning","arXiv251009357v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Generation expansion planning","GEP","a prominent example"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"What":2.0,"Performance Guarantees":2.0,"Time Series Aggregation":2.0,"Generation Expansion Planning":2.0,"arXiv251009357v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Generation expansion planning":1.0,"GEP":1.0,"a prominent example":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7827319830555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5697,"joy":0.0027,"surprise":0.0085,"sadness":0.017,"fear":0.1338,"anger":0.1664,"disgust":0.102},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel time series aggregation method for generation expansion planning (GEP) that provides performance guarantees.

We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds. Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_faaff231e8d5","title":"Modeling Protein Diffusion Across ER","content":"arXiv:2510.09479v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest continuous membrane-bound organelle in the cell and plays a central role in the synthesis and turnover of many lipids and proteins. It connects directly to the nucleus through specialized contact points known as ER-nuclear envelope (NE) junctions. In our recent study, we found that these ER-NE junctions are both narrow and infrequent, measuring less than 20 nanometers in diameter and occurring at a frequency of approximately 0.1 per square micrometer. However, it remains unclear whether such limited and narrow connections are sufficient to support efficient transport between the ER and NE. Here, we built a mathematical model of ER-to-NE protein diffusion, incorporating ultrastructural parameters, the frequency of ER-NE junctions, and the diffusion coefficient of proteins within the ER lumen. To validate the model, we experimentally quantified the transport rate of ER luminal proteins to the NE using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Our model and experimental data demonstrate that simple diffusion is sufficient to account for the rapid transport of proteins from the ER to the NE, despite the limited and narrow nature of the connecting junctions. Together, these findings offer mechanistic insight into how ER-NE connectivity enables rapid protein transport and lay the groundwork for future studies on ER-nucleus communication.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09479","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.942869","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","mathematics","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Sara Merino-Aceituno, Carmela Moschella, Shotaro Otsuka, Christian Schmeiser, Julia Scholz","raw_content_length":1457,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Modeling Protein Diffusion Across ER"],"persons":[],"locations":["organelle"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1456,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Modeling Protein Diffusion","arXiv251009479v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The endoplasmic reticulum","the largest continuous membrane-bound organelle","the cell","a central role","the synthesis","turnover","many lipids"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Modeling Protein Diffusion":2.0,"arXiv251009479v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The endoplasmic reticulum":1.0,"the largest continuous membrane-bound organelle":1.0,"the cell":1.0,"a central role":1.0,"the synthesis":1.0,"turnover":1.0,"many lipids":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7829508708333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8708,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.0905,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0084,"disgust":0.012},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a mathematical model validated by experimental data (FRAP) to understand protein transport between the ER and NE.

This paper proposed an analytic framework based on the geometric control theory to characterize the dynamical properties intrinsic to a model's parameterization. We prove that the Structural Invariant Manifolds (SIMs) of an analytic model $F(\\mathbf{\\theta})(\\mathbf{x})$--submanifolds that confine gradient flow trajectories independent of data and loss--are unions of orbits of the vector field family $\\{\\nabla_{\\mathbf{\\theta}} F(\\cdot)(\\mathbf{x})\\mid\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d\\}$. We then prove that a model's symmetry, e.g., permutation symmetry for neural networks, induces SIMs. Applying this, we characterize the hierarchy of symmetry-induced SIMs in fully-connected networks, where dynamics exhibit neuron condensation and equivalence to reduced-width networks. For two-layer networks, we prove all SIMs are symmetry-induced, closing the gap between known symmetries and all possible invariants. Overall, by establishing the framework for analyzing SIMs induced by architecture, our work paves the way for a deeper analysis of neural network training dynamics and generalization in the near future.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09564","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.947121","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathds","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Jiajie Zhao, Tao Luo, Yaoyu Zhang","raw_content_length":1359,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Structural Invariant Manifolds"],"persons":["F(\\mathbf{\\theta})(\\mathbf{x})$--submanifolds"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1358,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Architecture","Structural Invariant Manifolds","Neural Network Training Dynamics","arXiv251009564v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","architecture","key","the performance","deep neural networks","its precise effect"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Architecture","architecture"],"ai_ml":["Neural Network Training Dynamics","deep neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Architecture":2.0,"Structural Invariant Manifolds":2.0,"Neural Network Training Dynamics":2.0,"arXiv251009564v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"architecture":1.0,"key":1.0,"the performance":1.0,"deep neural networks":1.0,"its precise effect":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7831128419444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8032,"joy":0.0296,"surprise":0.0358,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0562,"anger":0.0431,"disgust":0.0259},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing neural network training dynamics.

In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08167","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.950840","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","quant-ph","cond-matstat-mech","mathematics","math-ph","hep-th","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Alexander Lopez, S\\'ebastien Fumeron, Malte Henkel, Trifce Sandev, Esther D.

We demonstrate that by utilizing unitary heat engines of different kinds, we can capitalize on the full entropy capacity of the ensemble across multiple conserved quantities. This leads to the extraction of energetic work with efficiencies surpassing the standard Carnot efficiency limit, all the while running at maximum power. This is achieved without requiring modified thermal sources, which is a method commonly used in the field of quantum heat engines. We pay particular attention to spin angular momentum, and show that when treated as a mutually independent conserved quantity, spin baths exhibit thermodynamic behaviour analogous to conventional heat baths, with corresponding quantities and models. This includes spin-analogous heat capacities, Einstein solid and Debye models, entropic responses, and Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Spin baths also follow the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Further, we examine the role of particle statistics in determining the maximum entropy capacity of the battery. In doing so, we argue that indistinguishability is necessary for interactions to occur, motivating a perspective in which information itself is treated as the indistinguishable property of particles, with information (in the form of coherence) transferable between both physical degrees of freedom such as energy and spin, and particles when the system acts unitarily. This work will find application in fields that require near energy degenerate spin statistics, such as in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and spintronics. Further, our method will have implications for the fields of quantum heat engines, quantum batteries, quantum error correction, and in information and resource theories.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08989","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.956210","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","quant-ph","mathematics","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":273,"author":"Liam Judd McClelland","raw_content_length":1943,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.365,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1942,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Carnot limit","extraction","an entropy battery","energetic work","arXiv251008989v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","the consequences","generalized thermodynamics","the perspective"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Carnot limit":2.0,"extraction":2.0,"an entropy battery":2.0,"energetic work":2.0,"arXiv251008989v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the consequences":1.0,"generalized thermodynamics":1.0,"the perspective":1.0}},"age_hours":2.783443032777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7477,"joy":0.1376,"surprise":0.0851,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0045,"anger":0.0146,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on exceeding the Carnot limit using an entropy battery.

First, we investigate quantum correlations in interactive settings, including the CHSH and graph isomorphism games. We aim to distinguish quantum correlations from non-signaling correlations by leveraging the principle of communication complexity. To this end, we employ techniques such as distributed computation, majority-function-based distillation protocols, the algebraic and geometric properties of nonlocal box wirings, and variations of some graph properties such as isomorphism, transitivity, and equitable partitions. This inquiry advances our understanding of non-physical correlations. Second, we address a key open problem in cryptography: the feasibility of unclonable encryption. We aim to construct an encryption scheme that prevents two distant parties from simultaneously obtaining information about a shared encrypted message. We introduce a candidate for unclonable encryption in the plain model, i.e. without assumptions, in working towards an unconditional proof. Our protocol is based on Clifford algebra, utilizing complex Hermitian unitary matrices that anti-commute. For small key sizes, we rigorously prove security using sum-of-squares methods, while for larger key sizes, we provide strong numerical evidence via the NPA hierarchy.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09457","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.960382","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","quant-ph","mathco","mathematics","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Pierre Botteron","raw_content_length":1413,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CHSH","Nonlocal Games Through Communication Complexity"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1408,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nonlocal Games","Communication Complexity","Quantum Cryptography","quantum correlations","arXiv251009457v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This thesis","foundational aspects","quantum information theory"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nonlocal Games":2.0,"Communication Complexity":2.0,"Quantum Cryptography":2.0,"quantum correlations":2.0,"arXiv251009457v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This thesis":1.0,"foundational aspects":1.0,"quantum information theory":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7835903441666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.851,"joy":0.017,"surprise":0.0119,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0582,"anger":0.0326,"disgust":0.0232},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes theoretical research in quantum information theory and cryptography.

While the Schwinger effect is usually attributed to a static electric background, its derivation is actually based on a switching on/off of the electric field in the infinite past/future. Motivated by this, and our previous work on particle production in a gravitational background, we consider a long pulse of the gravitational field in an FLRW-spacetime, thus simulating a static background. We rigorously derive particle production by a novel application of the Heun equation. In fact, the recently obtained connecting formulas between its local solutions can be used to determine the Bogolyubov coefficients, and subsequently the particle production probabilities, in the limit of an infinitely long pulse. The particle production in the FLRW-model is found to have a lower threshold on the outgoing frequencies, which can be related to the duration of the time interval of the switching on/off the background field. For large frequencies and in the spatially flat case, we find black-body radiation whose temperature is inversely proportional to the radius of the apparent horizon that appears in the FLRW-model during the phase of scale change. We compare our findings to Schwinger's result on particle production for a long pulse of an electromagnetic background field, for which we also include a detailed derivation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09481","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.960823","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","gr-qc","preprints","mathematics","math-ph","hep-th","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Walter D. van Suijlekom, Michael F.

A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may in general be divided into strict variational symmetries, divergence symmetries and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is a broadly applicable method for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated here by example, it can be applied to models with many variables, parameters and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries may be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.962090","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","hep-ph","mathematics","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"M.

This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines.

Specifically, we establish a concentration inequality of Bernstein type for ergodic averages $\\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T f(X_t)\\, dt$. As a consequence we provide two types of performance guarantees: (a) explicit non-asymptotic confidence intervals for $\\int f d\\mu_*$ when using a finite time ergodic average with given initial condition $\\mu$ and (b) uncertainty quantification (UQ) bounds, expressed in terms of relative entropy rate, on the bias of $\\int f d\\mu_*$ when using an alternative or approximate processes $\\widetilde{X}_t$.

Previous works have shown its occurrence and have given correct upper bounds on the rate of expansion in some particular cases, but precise lower bounds were still missing. In this paper, we provide a sharp lower bound for this acceleration rate, valid for a large class of dispersion operators. Our results manage to cover fractional Laplace operators and standard convolutions in a unified way, which is new in the literature. A first very important result of the paper is a general flattening estimate of independent interest: this phenomenon appears regularly in acceleration situations, but getting quantitative estimates is most of the time open. This estimate at hand, we construct a very subtle sub-solution that captures the expected dynamics of the accelerating solution (rates of expansion and flattening) and identifies several various regimes that appear in the dynamics depending on the parameters of the problem.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09911","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.963691","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathap","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Emeric Bouin, J\\'er\\^ome Coville, Guillaume Legendre","raw_content_length":1095,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.82,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Sharp","Laplace"],"persons":["Allee"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1094,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a weak Allee effect","Sharp exponent","acceleration","general nonlocal equations","arXiv210509911v3 Announce Type","Abstract","an acceleration phenomenon","monostable integro-differential equations","Previous works","its occurrence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a weak Allee effect":3.0,"Sharp exponent":2.0,"acceleration":2.0,"general nonlocal equations":2.0,"arXiv210509911v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"an acceleration phenomenon":1.0,"monostable integro-differential equations":1.0,"Previous works":1.0,"its occurrence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.783716559722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5830000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8834,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9269,"joy":0.0081,"surprise":0.0309,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0034,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical mathematical models of population dynamics with a weak Allee effect, which can be relevant to understanding the spread of invasive species or the recovery of endangered species.

These are the monoid algebras K[M(X,r)] and K[A(X,r)], over a field K, of its structure monoid M(X,r) and left derived structure monoid A(X,r). In case r is bijective (and thus also right non-degenerate) it is known that these algebras are representable (hence PI), left and right Noetherian and have finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. Moreover, such algebras are domains (or equivalently prime) if and only if they have finite global dimension, which also is equivalent to r being an involutive map. In this paper we deal with structure algebras of arbitrary finite left non-degenerate solutions (X,r), except for the last section. If (X,r) satisfies additional conditions, such as being bijective, idempotent or left derived, it has been shown in a series of papers that K[M(X,r)] is left Noetherian. In the first part of the paper we show that the algebra K[M(X,r)] always is left Noetherian. Via divisibility by generators, we construct an ideal chain in M(X,r) that has very strong algebraic structural properties on its Rees factors. This allows to obtain characterizations of when the algebras K[M(X,r)] and K[A(X,r)] are right Noetherian. Intricate relationships between ring-theoretical and homological properties of these algebras and properties of the solution (X,r) are proven. Furthermore, we describe the cancellative congruences of A(X,r) and M(X,r) as well as the prime spectrum of K[A(X,r)]. This then leads to an explicit formula for the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of K[M(X,r)] and it equals the classical Krull dimension.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06023","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.966459","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathra","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":271,"author":"Ilaria Colazzo, Eric Jespers, {\\L}ukasz Kubat, Arne Van Antwerpen","raw_content_length":1814,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.355,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["A(X"],"persons":["algebras K[M(X","Yang"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1813,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Structure algebras","finite set-theoretic solutions","the Yang-","Announce Type","Abstract","Quadratic algebras","some classes","finite","non-degenerate solutions","the Yang"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Structure algebras":2.0,"finite set-theoretic solutions":2.0,"the Yang-":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Quadratic algebras":1.0,"some classes":1.0,"finite":1.0,"non-degenerate solutions":1.0,"the Yang":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7838230513888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8276,"joy":0.0147,"surprise":0.0288,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.0492,"anger":0.0411,"disgust":0.0252},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper is theoretical mathematics research into algebraic structures.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_66d880c93db1","title":"Global logarithmic deformation theory","content":"arXiv:2310.07949v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A classical problem in algebraic geometry is to construct smooth algebraic varieties with prescribed properties. In the approach via smoothings, one first constructs a degenerate scheme with the prescribed properties, and then shows the existence of a smooth variety degenerating to this scheme. Logarithmic geometry has given important new impulses to the second step of this approach, which we explore in this book. Degenerations, in particular in the context of mirror symmetry, often enjoy similar formal properties as smooth morphisms once considered from the logarithmic perspective. Logarithmic deformation theory has therefore become an effective tool for the construction of smoothings and the transfer of properties between smooth nearby fibers and the singular special fiber. The strongest existence result for deformations in classical algebraic geometry is the Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov theorem for Calabi--Yau varieties. A logarithmic variant, once established, constructs log smooth deformations. However, the logarithmic Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov theorem has resisted efforts to its proof for a while. Finally, a method to prove it was discovered in 2019 by Chan, Leung, and Ma. In this book, we explore this new approach to the logarithmic Bogomolov--Tian--Todorov theorem. We prove several variants of the abstract unobstructedness theorem, some of which are new and stronger than previously known results. We investigate its application to the global deformation theory of log smooth and mildly log singular spaces, obtaining unobstructedness results for log Calabi--Yau spaces, some log Fano spaces, and line bundles. Special care is taken to allow sufficiently mild log singularities, including all log singularities that appear in the Gross--Siebert construction of toric log Calabi--Yau mirror pairs.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07949","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.968424","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathag","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":264,"author":"Simon Felten","raw_content_length":1878,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.32,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Todorov","Bogomolov"],"persons":["smooth morphisms","arXiv:2310.07949v3 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1873,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Global logarithmic deformation theory","arXiv231007949v3 Announce Type","Abstract","A classical problem","algebraic geometry","smooth algebraic varieties","prescribed properties","the approach","smoothings","a degenerate scheme"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algebraic geometry"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Global logarithmic deformation theory":2.0,"arXiv231007949v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"A classical problem":1.0,"algebraic geometry":1.0,"smooth algebraic varieties":1.0,"prescribed properties":1.0,"the approach":1.0,"smoothings":1.0,"a degenerate scheme":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7838980669444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8885,"joy":0.011,"surprise":0.0267,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0148,"anger":0.0257,"disgust":0.0267},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes theoretical mathematical research.
