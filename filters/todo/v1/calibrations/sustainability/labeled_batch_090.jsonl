{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_9ffa4857aedb","title":"Doden en gewonden bij pro","content":"Bij een pro-Palestina mars in Pakistan zijn vijf mensen om het leven gekomen. Het gaat om drie demonstranten, een agent en een omstander, schrijven lokale media. Tientallen mensen zouden gewond zijn geraakt, onder wie agenten. Volgens de politiechef van de regio Punjab openden demonstranten het vuur op politieagenten. Betogers van de politieke partij Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) melden dat juist de autoriteiten hebben geschoten. De mars liep uit de hand toen betogers probeerden scheepscontainers op de weg te verplaatsen. Die waren daar geplaatst om betogers tegen te houden. Persbureau AP schrijft dat sommige Pakistaanse burgers vinden dat de overheid geen blokkades had moeten plaatsen. Aanhangers van de TLP liepen sinds afgelopen vrijdag vanuit de stad Lahore in een mars richting de Pakistaanse hoofdstad Islamabad. Het was de bedoeling om daar bij de Amerikaanse ambassade in het land een pro-Palestijnse betoging te houden. Afgelopen zaterdag werden meer dan honderd deelnemers aan de mars gearresteerd. Extremistische partij TLP In een video, die iets voor zonsondergang lokale tijd is opgenomen, sprak de partijleider Saad Rizvi vandaag agenten toe. Hij verzoekt ze te stoppen met schieten bij de protestmars en zegt dat hij graag met ze in gesprek wil. Op de achtergrond zijn schoten te horen. TLP meldt dat Rizvi gewond is geraakt. De protestmars werd georganiseerd door TLP, een in Pakistan verboden islamitische politieke partij met extreme ideeën als de doodstraf voor mensen die de islam bespotten. De afgelopen jaren organiseerde de partij meerdere gewelddadige demonstraties na koranverbrandingen in het buitenland. Ook werden in 2021 drie mensen gedood bij gevechten tussen de politie en aanhangers van TLP. De veiligheidsdiensten werden bekogeld met brandbommen en vijf agenten werden ontvoerd. TLP deelde vandaag video's waarop te zien is dat auto's in brand staan, onder meer een grote wagen die met vertegenwoordigers van de politieke partij daarin voor de mars uitreed. Geert Wilders Ook in 2019 werden er massale protesten gevoerd door TLP, na de veroordeling van de Pakistaan Junaid I. Hij kreeg tien jaar cel voor het voorbereiden van een aanslag op de Nederlandse PVV-leider Wilders. Hij was boos over Wilders' geplande cartoonwedstrijd over de profeet Mohammed. Partijleider Saad Rizvi is eveneens geen onbekende. In 2024 kreeg hij in Nederland vier jaar cel omdat hij Wilders met de dood had bedreigd. Rizvi werd beschuldigd van opruiing en bedreiging.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586320","published_date":"2025-10-13T11:56:21","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:52:04.466722","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":382,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2801,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TLP"],"persons":["Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan","Pakistan"],"locations":["Punjab","Islamabad"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2491,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Doden","pro","mensen","een pro-Palestina mars","leven","Het","demonstranten","een agent","een omstander","lokale media"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["pro"],"hydrogen_energy":["pro"],"engineering":["pro"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Doden":2.0,"pro":2.0,"mensen":2.0,"een pro-Palestina mars":1.0,"leven":1.0,"Het":1.0,"demonstranten":1.0,"een agent":1.0,"een omstander":1.0,"lokale media":1.0}},"age_hours":1.0269581680555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4939,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6875,"joy":0.0192,"surprise":0.086,"sadness":0.034,"fear":0.0648,"anger":0.0479,"disgust":0.0605},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"transition_delay","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":0,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":0,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a violent protest.

Andere bussen met Palestijnen die vrijkomen uit Israëlische gevangenissen zijn onder meer onderweg naar het Nasser-ziekenhuis in Gaza. Volgens de afspraken van de eerste fase van het akkoord heeft Israël bijna 2000 gevangen Palestijnen, allemaal mannen, vrijgelaten. 250 Palestijnen van hen waren veroordeeld tot levenslange of lange celstraffen voor terrorisme en andere zware misdrijven. De grootste groep, zo'n 1700, bestaat uit Palestijnen die na de terreuraanslag door Hamas twee jaar geleden zijn opgepakt. Ze waren niet betrokken bij de aanslag zelf, maar zijn in de nasleep ervan opgepakt door Israël. Zonder proces of aanklacht Velen van hen zaten in zogeheten 'administratieve detentie', waarbij ze zonder proces of zelfs aanklacht voor onbepaalde tijd kunnen worden vastgehouden. Onder deze groep zouden enkele tientallen minderjarigen zijn. De groep in Ramallah werd door een grote menigte en onder luid gejuich binnengehaald. De vrijgelaten Palestijnen werden uitvoerig geknuffeld en op de schouders genomen. Bekijk hier beelden van het moment dat de Palestijnen aankwamen in Ramallah: Vanochtend vroeg werden bij de Ofer-gevangenis op de bezette Westoever en bij de Ketziot-gevangenis in de Negev-woestijn bussen klaargezet om de Palestijnen over te dragen. Die gingen pas rijden nadat alle Israëlische gijzelaars weer voet hadden gezet in Israël. Een Israëlische legerwoordvoerder zegt tegen The Times of Israel dat alle Palestijnen die vrij zouden komen inmiddels vrij zijn. De krant schrijft dat Israël aanvankelijk had willen wachten tot ook de lichamen van 28 overgebleven overleden gijzelaars door Hamas zouden zijn overgedragen, maar dat daarvan is afgezien. Een Israëlische organisatie van gijzelaarsfamilies laat in een verklaring weten geschokt te zijn dat vandaag naar verwachting maar vier lichamen van gegijzelde Israëliërs worden overgedragen door Hamas. Volgens de afspraken die zijn gemaakt had de terreurorganisatie alle 28 lichamen moeten overdragen. Hamas had vooraf al gezegd dat dit lastig zou worden, mede door de verwoestingen in de Gazastrook.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586317","published_date":"2025-10-13T11:25:13","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:52:04.467698","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":323,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2542,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.615,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Westelijke Jordaanoever","Hamas"],"locations":["Israël","Gaza"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2213,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["armen","familie","De eerste bussen","Palestijnen","de Palestijnse stad","Andere bussen","die","Israëlische gevangenissen","het Nasser-ziekenhuis","de afspraken"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"armen":2.0,"familie":2.0,"De eerste bussen":1.0,"Palestijnen":1.0,"de Palestijnse stad":1.0,"Andere bussen":1.0,"die":1.0,"Israëlische gevangenissen":1.0,"het Nasser-ziekenhuis":1.0,"de afspraken":1.0}},"age_hours":1.5458617816666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3336,"joy":0.0622,"surprise":0.1364,"sadness":0.0716,"fear":0.2151,"anger":0.0957,"disgust":0.0853},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of an agreement.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_0cc8509dad6e","title":"Nobelprijs voor Economie heeft met Joel Mokyr dit jaar Nederlands tintje","content":"De Nobelprijs voor Economie gaat dit jaar naar de Amerikaan Joel Mokyr, de Fransman Phillipe Aghion en de Canadees Peter Howitt. Ze krijgen de prijs voor hun onderzoek naar de bijdrage van innovatie aan economische groei, meldt het Nobelcomité in de Zweedse hoofdstad Stockholm. Joel Mokyr krijgt de prijs \"voor het identificeren van de voorwaarden voor duurzame groei door technologische vooruitgang\". Mokyr gebruikte historische bronnen om te achterhalen waarom economische groei zo'n tweehonderd jaar geleden de nieuwe norm werd. Want voor die tijd was er amper groei en de welvaart ging ook niet vooruit. Phillipe Aghion en Peter Howitt ontwikkelden een wiskundig model voor wat creatieve vernietiging wordt genoemd: wanneer een nieuw en beter product op de markt komt, zijn de bedrijven die de verouderde producten verkopen de dupe. Zo kun je denken aan streaming die cd's en dvd's vervangt. Eigentijdse inzichten \"Deze onderzoekers hebben op cruciale wijze laten zien hoe belangrijk creatieve destructie is voor groei en stijgende welvaart in een maatschappij,\" zegt hoogleraar financiële economie Ingrid Werner, lid van de Nobelcommissie tegen de NOS. Dit soort inzichten is precies wat Europa momenteel nodig heeft. Hoe de EU kan opboksen tegen de VS en China is het onderwerp van gesprek onder Europese economen. Is dat de reden dat juist deze economen nu de Nobelprijs winnen? Zeker niet, zegt Werner. Het is mooi meegenomen als hun werk onderdeel wordt van het maatschappelijke debat, zegt ze. Maar de prijs wordt toegekend op basis van hoe invloedrijk iemands werk is geweest. \"Om dat te weten, moet je zeker een paar decennia wachten. En we zien vandaag dat de conclusies die deze economen trokken, twintig en dertig jaar geleden, daadwerkelijk kloppen en dat hun werk heel waardevol is geweest voor hoe wij de economie vandaag de dag begrijpen.\" Nederlands tintje Opvallend is dat Joel Mokyr op 26 juli 1946 in Leiden is geboren. Hij verhuisde als kind naar Israël. Zijn ouders waren Nederlandse joden die de Holocaust overleefden. Zijn vader stierf aan kanker toen Mokyr een jaar oud was, vertelde hij eerder in een interview aan de Wall Street Journal. Hij behaalde later zijn bachelor in economie en geschiedenis aan de Hebreeuwse Universiteit van Jeruzalem en promoveerde vervolgens aan de Yale Universiteit. Sinds 1994 is hij hoogleraar economie en geschiedenis aan de Northwestern University in Chicago. In totaal waren er drie eerdere Nederlanders die de Nobelprijs voor Economie hebben gewonnen: Guido Imbens in 2021, Tjalling Koopmans in 1975 en Jan Tinbergen. Hij ontving de Nobelprijs bij de allereerste editie in 1969. Geen echte Nobelprijs De Nobelprijs voor Economie is eigenlijk geen echte Nobelprijs, omdat deze niet door Alfred Nobel zelf is bedacht. De andere Nobelprijzen worden al sinds 1901 uitgereikt, de Nobelprijs voor Economie pas sinds 1969. Die eerste keer was toen ter ere van de 300ste verjaardag van de Zweedse centrale bank. De officiële benaming is dan ook 'De Prijs van de Zweedse Rijksbank voor Economische Wetenschappen ter nagedachtenis aan Alfred Nobel'. De prijs wordt altijd wel samen met de meeste andere Nobelprijzen uitgereikt op 10 december in de Zweedse hoofdstad Stockholm. Dat is de sterfdag van Alfred Nobel. Alleen de Nobelprijs voor de Vrede wordt ergens anders uitgereikt, namelijk in de Noorse hoofdstad Oslo, maar wel op dezelfde dag. Afgelopen jaar ging de Nobelprijs voor Economie naar een ander drietal: de Turks-Amerikaanse Daron Acemoglu, de Brits-Amerikaanse Simon Johnson en de Brit James A. Robinson. Ze deden onderzoek naar hoe het verschil in welvaart tussen landen ontstaat. Dat deden ze door te kijken naar hoe instituties zich vormen in een land en hoe de instituties vervolgens de ontwikkeling van de rijkdom van een land beïnvloeden.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586311","published_date":"2025-10-13T10:35:48","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:52:04.468950","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":603,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4321,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Amerikaan Joel Mokyr"],"persons":["Joel Mokyr","Phillipe Aghion","Peter Howitt"],"locations":["Stockholm","Nobelprijs","Mokyr"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3814,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Economie","dit jaar","de prijs","economische groei","Phillipe","hun onderzoek","de bijdrage","innovatie","de Zweedse hoofdstad","de voorwaarden"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Economie":3.0,"dit jaar":3.0,"de prijs":2.0,"economische groei":2.0,"Phillipe":1.0,"hun onderzoek":1.0,"de bijdrage":1.0,"innovatie":1.0,"de Zweedse hoofdstad":1.0,"de voorwaarden":1.0}},"age_hours":2.3694889372222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7206,"joy":0.0181,"surprise":0.1058,"sadness":0.031,"fear":0.0448,"anger":0.0373,"disgust":0.0424},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the Nobel Prize awarded for research on innovation's contribution to economic growth and sustainable growth through technological advancement.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_69ca87693696","title":"Nederlands spoor niet weerbaar genoeg in tijd van toenemende dreigingen","content":"Het Nederlandse spoor is niet goed voorbereid op dreigingen als sabotage en cyberaanvallen en de stijgende vraag naar militair vervoer. Dit blijkt uit een nieuw adviesrapport dat het Overlegorgaan Fysieke Leefomgeving (OFL) vandaag overhandigt aan demissionair staatssecretaris Thierry Aartsen van Openbaar Vervoer en Milieu. Uit het rapport blijkt dat het Nederlandse spoornetwerk voor een grote uitdaging staat. Jarenlang lag de focus op efficiëntie, punctualiteit en kostenbeheersing, waarbij slecht weer en technische storingen de voornaamste uitdagingen waren. Die aanpak is volgens dit rapport niet langer toereikend. Fysieke sabotage, cyberaanvallen en hybride dreigingen zijn reëel geworden en ook de kans op ernstige incidenten groeit. Sabotage De kabelbrand nabij Schiphol tijdens de NAVO-top van juni en verschillende pogingen tot cybersabotage laten die kwetsbaarheid van het spoor zien. Daarom adviseert het OFL om cameradetectiesystemen te ontwikkelen die verdacht gedrag direct signaleren, de beveiliging bij kritieke locaties te verbeteren en in antidronemaatregelen te investeren. Meer militair vervoer Niet alleen is het spoor kwetsbaar voor sabotage, ook neemt de vraag naar militair spoorvervoer toe. Als NAVO-lidstaat heeft Nederland verplichtingen en moet het in staat zijn grootschalige militaire transporten door het land veilig en snel te organiseren. Maar het huidige spoorsysteem kan een structurele toename van militair vervoer niet aan zonder grote impact op het normale verkeer. Een toename van militair verkeer zal dus leiden tot overlast voor andere gebruikers. Eén militaire trein kan het civiele verkeer op een traject tot drie uur vertragen, blijkt uit dit rapport. Investeringen en maatregelen Het OFL adviseert spoorbeheerder ProRail om zich beter voor te bereiden op grote incidenten. Dit betekent onder andere zorgen voor meer reserveonderdelen, extra herstelcapaciteit en het opstellen van draaiboeken voor grootschalige verstoringen. Daarnaast moet de informatie-uitwisseling tussen ProRail, het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat en de Nationaal Coördinator Terrorismebestrijding en Veiligheid (NCTV) worden verbeterd. Voor de uitvoering van deze maatregelen wordt een investering van minimaal 600 miljoen euro aanbevolen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586307","published_date":"2025-10-13T10:00:52","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:52:04.469857","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":313,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2576,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.565,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OFL"],"persons":["Fysieke Leefomgeving","Jarenlang","Fysieke","Thierry Aartsen"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2273,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nederlands spoor","tijd","Het Nederlandse spoor","sabotage","cyberaanvallen","de stijgende vraag","militair vervoer","Dit","het Overlegorgaan","Leefomgeving"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["militair vervoer"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nederlands spoor":2.0,"tijd":2.0,"Het Nederlandse spoor":1.0,"sabotage":1.0,"cyberaanvallen":1.0,"de stijgende vraag":1.0,"militair vervoer":1.0,"Dit":1.0,"het Overlegorgaan":1.0,"Leefomgeving":1.0}},"age_hours":2.9517263505555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.4985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7003,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7876,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0872,"sadness":0.0278,"fear":0.0352,"anger":0.0295,"disgust":0.0257},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses investments in security measures for the Dutch railway system, including camera detection and anti-drone measures.

Daarbij zijn ongeveer honderd gewonden gevallen, zegt de minister van Binnenlands Zaken volgens tv-zender Ta3. Twee van hen verkeren in kritieke toestand. De minister omschrijft het ongeluk als een \"buitengewoon verkeersongeval\". De botsing was bij een tunnel, niet ver van het dorp Jablonov nad Turnou. Het zou zijn gebeurd op een punt waar twee sporen samengaan in een enkelspoor. De officiële oorzaak van het ongeluk staat nog niet vast, maar de minister zegt dat een menselijke fout waarschijnlijk is. \"Het blijkt dat een van de machinisten een fout heeft gemaakt en waarschijnlijk geen voorrang heeft verleend, maar dat is vooralsnog slechts een voorlopige conclusie.\" De spoorwegmaatschappij zegt dat de prioriteit ligt bij \"het redden en evacueren van passagiers en onze medewerkers\".

Bij het dorpje Maarheeze, vlak bij de grens met België, werden gisterenavond twee Cobra's gevonden. \"De Cobra's waren gevonden door iemand in de omgeving en bij het tankstation afgegeven\", zegt de politie. Het meest aannemelijke is dat zij gevonden zijn in een prullenbak, aldus de woordvoerder. Wie het vuurwerk gedumpt heeft en waarom, is onbekend. De Cobra's waren door tankstationmedewerkers in een emmer water ondergedompeld. De politie op via X dat dat \"met alle goede bedoelingen\" en \"voor de veiligheid\" gebeurde, maar dat dit gevaarlijk is. \"Juist het water dat wordt opgenomen door het karton in combinatie met het flitspoeder vormt een gas en dat is ontzettend brandbaar. Als er eentje ontploft, dan ontploffen ze allemaal.\" Uit voorzorg werd het tankstation ontruimd. Nadat de explosievenopruimingsdienst (EOD) de Cobra's had veiliggesteld, kon het pompstation worden heropend. Wat is een Cobra? De NOS schreef eerder over het illegale vuurwerk: Zes vragen over de Cobra, het meest besproken explosief van Nederland. Het ging om twee stuks Cobra 6 knalvuurwerk, dat door een kruitlading een krachtige explosie veroorzaakt. Er zit flitspoeder in, een zeer gevoelige explosieve stof die snel kan ontsteken. Er zijn ook andere type Cobra's bijvoorbeeld Cobra 8 en Cobra 12. Hoe hoger het getal, hoe meer flitspoeder en hoe sterker de explosie. Het vuurwerk is populair bij criminelen en jongeren.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_21cca7f0cd55","title":"Vanaf volgend jaar nieuw HPV","content":"Kinderen die zich laten inenten tegen HPV krijgen vanaf volgend jaar een nieuw vaccin. Demissionair staatssecretaris Tielen van Volksgezondheid schrijft in een brief aan de Tweede Kamer dat het ministerie het advies van de Gezondheidsraad van vorige week opvolgt. De Gezondheidsraad adviseerde vorige week, op basis van wetenschappelijk onderzoek, om voortaan kinderen met het nieuwe 9-valente vaccin te laten vaccineren. Het nieuwe middel werkt even goed als het huidige vaccin, en biedt meer bescherming tegen nog andere types van het virus, zoals genitale wratten. Baarmoederhalskanker In het jaar dat kinderen 10 worden kunnen ze via het Rijksprogramma twee prikken krijgen met het vaccin dat nu nog beschermt tegen twee typen HPV. Voor iedereen tot 18 jaar is de vaccinatie gratis. Het HPV-virus kan tijdens seks worden overgedragen via de huid of mond door iemand die besmet is. Het kan onder meer baarmoederhalskanker en andere vormen van kanker veroorzaken. Ieder jaar krijgen naar schatting 1100 vrouwen en 400 mannen kanker door HPV. En jaarlijks krijgen ongeveer 900 mensen in Nederland de diagnose baarmoederhalskanker. De ziekte treft vooral vrouwen tussen de 30 en 45 jaar. \"Bij vrouwen die gevaccineerd zijn tegen HPV komt baarmoederhalskanker 90 procent minder vaak voor dan bij ongevaccineerde vrouwen. Ook ernstige voorstadia van baarmoederhalskanker komen 80 procent minder vaak voor\", zegt staatssecretaris Tielen. \"Dit nieuwe vaccin bereikt een nog groter effect: het beschermt niet tegen twee, maar tegen negen typen van HPV. Dat betekent een nog kleinere kans op baarmoederhalskanker, andere vormen van kanker en voorstadia daarvan. Daarmee kunnen we heel veel ellende voor vrouwen en hun gezinnen voorkomen.\" Het nieuwe 9-valente vaccin wordt naar verwachting pas vanaf het najaar van 2026 gebruikt. \"Driekwart van de opgeroepen meisjes en de helft van de jongens krijgt het vaccin\", zegt Tielen. \"Dat gaat om duizenden vaccinaties; dat moeten we goed voorbereiden, en er moet een goede prijs voor worden afgesproken. Daarna moeten alle vaccinatielocaties het nieuwe vaccin krijgen, en moet het op de juiste manier worden bewaard. Dat vergt zorgvuldige voorbereiding en tijd.\" Wat is HPV? HPV staat voor het humaan papillomavirus, een seksueel overdraagbaar virus. Het is zeer besmettelijk: acht op de tien mensen raken er ooit mee besmet. Meestal ruimt het lichaam het virus binnen een of twee jaar zelf op. Bij 10 tot 20 procent van de gevallen lukt dat niet en kan HPV (een voorstadium van) kanker veroorzaken. Baarmoederhalskanker is de vorm die het meest voorkomt, maar ook kanker aan de schaamlippen is mogelijk. Ook mannen kunnen kanker krijgen door het virus, zoals aan de mond en keel, de penis en anus. Jaarlijks krijgen gemiddeld 1100 vrouwen en 400 mannen kanker door HPV. Inmiddels krijgen jongens en meisjes in het jaar dat ze 10 worden een uitnodiging om twee keer een vaccinatie tegen HPV te halen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586290","published_date":"2025-10-13T07:02:35","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:52:04.473178","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":460,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3692,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tweede Kamer","HPV"],"persons":["Tielen van Volksgezondheid"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2938,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["volgend jaar","vorige week","Kinderen","die","inenten","een nieuw vaccin","Demissionair staatssecretaris","Volksgezondheid","een brief","het ministerie"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Demissionair staatssecretaris"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"volgend jaar":3.0,"vorige week":2.0,"Kinderen":1.0,"die":1.0,"inenten":1.0,"een nieuw vaccin":1.0,"Demissionair staatssecretaris":1.0,"Volksgezondheid":1.0,"een brief":1.0,"het ministerie":1.0}},"age_hours":5.923175713611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7356,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0732,"sadness":0.0367,"fear":0.0655,"anger":0.0288,"disgust":0.0478},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"scaling","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":8,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the implementation of a new HPV vaccine program in the Netherlands, which is a concrete policy action.
