These models often suffer from poor audio quality in real datasets due to sole reliance on synthetic data. Moreover, some models are constrained to a closed vocabulary of sound events, preventing them from controlling audio generation for open-ended, free-text queries. This paper introduces PicoAudio2, a framework that advances temporal-controllable TTA by mitigating these data and architectural limitations. Specifically, we use a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation data. Moreover, we propose an enhanced architecture that integrates the fine-grained information from a timestamp matrix with coarse-grained free-text input. Experiments show that PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability and audio quality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00683","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.261314","language":"en","tags":["eessas","preprints","research","cssd","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Zihao Zheng, Zeyu Xie, Xuenan Xu, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Mengyue Wu","raw_content_length":1183,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1182,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PicoAudio2 Temporal Controllable Text","Announce Type","recent work","audio","fine-grained control","timestamp conditioning","its scope","audio quality and input format","These models","poor audio quality"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["fine-grained control"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PicoAudio2 Temporal Controllable Text":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"recent work":1.0,"audio":1.0,"fine-grained control":1.0,"timestamp conditioning":1.0,"its scope":1.0,"audio quality and input format":1.0,"These models":1.0,"poor audio quality":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7696062383333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":0.7990000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8402,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7337,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.0352,"sadness":0.0919,"fear":0.0226,"anger":0.0321,"disgust":0.0789},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new framework for temporal-controllable text-to-audio generation.

The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's and other public communities' perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems.

Ensuring these qualities is critical for scientific integrity and discovery. This paper asks whether Research Software Science (RSS)--the empirical study of how research software is developed and used--should be considered a form of metascience, the science of science. Classification matters because it could affect recognition, funding, and integration of RSS into research improvement. We define metascience and RSS, compare their principles and objectives, and examine their overlaps. Arguments for classification highlight shared commitments to reproducibility, transparency, and empirical study of research processes. Arguments against portraying RSS as a specialized domain focused on a tool rather than the broader scientific enterprise. Our analysis finds RSS advances core goals of metascience, especially in computational reproducibility, and bridges technical, social, and cognitive aspects of research. Its classification depends on whether one adopts a broad definition of metascience--any empirical effort to improve science--or a narrow one focused on systemic and epistemological structures. We argue RSS is best understood as a distinct interdisciplinary domain that aligns with, and in some definitions fits within, metascience. Recognizing it as such can strengthen its role in improving reliability, justify funding, and elevate software development in research institutions. Regardless of classification, applying scientific rigor to research software ensures the tools of discovery meet the standards of the discoveries themselves.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13436","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.276082","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":237,"author":"Evan Eisinger, Michael A.

We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVDecode), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVDecode is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVDecode paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 percentage points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 percentage points, with similar gains (1-2 percentage points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVDecode thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15888","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.277246","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Senkang Hu, Xudong Han, Jinqi Jiang, Yihang Tao, Zihan Fang, Yong Dai, Sam Tak Wu Kwong, Yuguang Fang","raw_content_length":1516,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Kullback-Leibler","SVDecode","Steering Vector Decoding"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1515,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Distribution","Announce Type","Adapting billion-parameter language models","a downstream task","parameter-efficient fine-tuning PEFT","cast task adaptation","output-distribution alignment","the objective","the output distribution","the task distribution"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Distribution":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Adapting billion-parameter language models":1.0,"a downstream task":1.0,"parameter-efficient fine-tuning PEFT":1.0,"cast task adaptation":1.0,"output-distribution alignment":1.0,"the objective":1.0,"the output distribution":1.0,"the task distribution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.770189496111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9274,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.0212,"sadness":0.0187,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0105,"disgust":0.0077},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (SVDecode) for improving the efficiency of large language models, potentially reducing the computational resources required for task adaptation.

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16950","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.278040","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Xuan Chen, Shiwei Feng, Zikang Xiong, Shengwei An, Yunshu Mao, Lu Yan, Guanhong Tao, Wenbo Guo, Xiangyu Zhang","raw_content_length":1387,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1386,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Temporal Logic-Based Multi-Vehicle Backdoor Attacks","Offline RL Agents","End","arXiv250916950v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the safety","autonomous driving AD systems","security threats","particularly backdoor attacks","a stepping stone"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Temporal Logic-Based Multi-Vehicle Backdoor Attacks":2.0,"Offline RL Agents":2.0,"End":2.0,"arXiv250916950v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the safety":1.0,"autonomous driving AD systems":1.0,"security threats":1.0,"particularly backdoor attacks":1.0,"a stepping stone":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7702197155555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.4175,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7165,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7447,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0297,"sadness":0.01,"fear":0.1596,"anger":0.0322,"disgust":0.0164},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents research on backdoor attacks against autonomous driving systems, specifically offline reinforcement learning agents.

This ability, however, hinges on Key-Value (KV) caching, whose memory grows linearly with dialogue length and quickly becomes the bottleneck in resource-constrained environments. An active line of research for reducing memory bottleneck is KV cache compression, which seeks to limit cache size while preserving accuracy. Yet existing methods face two major limitations: (i) evicting the KV cache after full-context prefill causes unbounded peak memory, and (ii) query-dependent eviction narrows the cache to a single query, leading to failure cases in multi-turn conversations. We introduce EpiCache, a training-free KV cache management framework for long conversational question answering (LongConvQA) under fixed memory budgets. EpiCache bounds cache growth through block-wise prefill and preserves topic-relevant context via episodic KV compression, which clusters conversation history into coherent episodes and applies episode-specific KV cache eviction.

Topological descriptors, which summarize important features of data, have proved to be viable tools to facilitate this task. The merge tree is a topological descriptor that captures the connectivity behaviors of the sub- or superlevel sets of a scalar field. Edit distances between merge trees play a vital role in effective temporal data tracking. Existing methods to compute them fall into two main classes, namely whether they are dependent or independent of the branch decomposition. These two classes represent the most prominent approaches for producing tracking results. In this paper, we compare four different merge tree edit distance-based methods for feature tracking. We demonstrate that these methods yield distinct results with both analytical and real-world data sets. Furthermore, we investigate how these results vary and identify the factors that influence them. Our experiments reveal significant differences in tracked features over time, even among those produced by techniques within the same category.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17974","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.278839","language":"en","tags":["research","csgr","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Son Le Thanh, Tino Weinkauf","raw_content_length":1171,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1170,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Comparative Study","Different Edit Distance","arXiv250917974v2","Announce Type","Abstract","time-varying scalar fields","a fundamental task","scientific computing","Topological descriptors","which"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A Comparative Study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Comparative Study":2.0,"Different Edit Distance":2.0,"arXiv250917974v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"time-varying scalar fields":1.0,"a fundamental task":1.0,"scientific computing":1.0,"Topological descriptors":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.770250205555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9114,"joy":0.017,"surprise":0.0416,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0127,"anger":0.0074,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper compares different methods for feature tracking in time-varying scalar fields, specifically focusing on merge tree edit distances.

Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18111","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.279229","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Faizul Rakib Sayem, Shahana Ibrahim","raw_content_length":1223,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1222,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Prompt Optimization","Subspace Representation Learning","Few-shot","distribution","arXiv250918111v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The reliability","artificial intelligence AI systems","open-world settings","their ability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["artificial intelligence AI systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Prompt Optimization":2.0,"Subspace Representation Learning":2.0,"Few-shot":2.0,"distribution":2.0,"arXiv250918111v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The reliability":1.0,"artificial intelligence AI systems":1.0,"open-world settings":1.0,"their ability":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7702657230555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.329,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8658,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9002,"joy":0.0226,"surprise":0.0468,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.0097,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI framework for improving the reliability of AI systems in identifying out-of-distribution inputs.

In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward.

While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22211","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.281648","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Tiago Fernandes Tavares","raw_content_length":1579,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RTP"],"persons":["Large Language Models"],"locations":["BERTopic"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1578,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Question","arXiv250922211v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Unsupervised analysis","text corpora","data-scarce domains","traditional topic models","these models","a solution","clusters"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["data-scarce domains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Question":2.0,"arXiv250922211v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Unsupervised analysis":1.0,"text corpora":1.0,"data-scarce domains":1.0,"traditional topic models":1.0,"these models":1.0,"a solution":1.0,"clusters":1.0}},"age_hours":2.770356408888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.71,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.058,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8677,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0537,"sadness":0.0116,"fear":0.0377,"anger":0.0139,"disgust":0.0087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework (RTP) for unsupervised text analysis using LLMs. While it demonstrates improved interpretability and utility in downstream tasks, it is still in the applied research phase with no concrete deployment or measurable climate impact.

We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\\geq NK\\log_2 K+N^2d^2\\log (1/\\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_682724850518","title":"Graph Your Own Prompt","content":"arXiv:2509.23373v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs). However, these existing approaches are inherently path-insensitive because they rely on fixed heuristics or limited contextual information and fail to reason about deep control-flow structures. As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects, JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the generation of high-coverage unit tests.

But outcome based rewards may cause reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting for the ``squeezing effect\", the probability mass of good actions should increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited, therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows its effectiveness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23870","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.286104","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Jingyu Liu, Xiaopeng Wu, Jingquan Peng, Kehan Chen, Chuan Yu, Lizhong Ding, Yong Liu","raw_content_length":1445,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GRPO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1444,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reward Miscalibration","GRPO","Agentic RL","which","arXiv250923870v2 Announce Type","Abstract","autonomous agents","long-horizon","real-world tasks","significant research interest"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["significant research interest"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reward Miscalibration":2.0,"GRPO":2.0,"Agentic RL":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv250923870v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"autonomous agents":1.0,"long-horizon":1.0,"real-world tasks":1.0,"significant research interest":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7705163991666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.836,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9672,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7771,"joy":0.009,"surprise":0.0062,"sadness":0.0173,"fear":0.0897,"anger":0.0646,"disgust":0.036},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a method to improve reinforcement learning agents by addressing reward miscalibration.

Recent work addresses these limitations by exploring DFA decomposition identification problems (DFA-DIPs), which model system behavior as intersections of multiple DFAs, offering modularity for complex tasks. However, existing DFA-DIP approaches depend on SAT encodings derived from Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptors (APTAs), incurring scalability limitations due to their inherent redundancy. In this work, we advance DFA-DIP research through studying two variants: the traditional Pareto-optimal DIP and the novel states-optimal DIP, which prioritizes a minimal number of states. We propose a novel framework that bridges DFA decomposition with recent advancements in automata representation. One of our key innovations replaces APTA with 3-valued DFA (3DFA) derived directly from labeled examples. This compact representation eliminates redundancies of APTA, thus drastically reducing variables in the improved SAT encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that our 3DFA-based approach achieves significant efficiency gains for the Pareto-optimal DIP while enabling a scalable solution for the states-optimal DIP.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24347","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.286501","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Junjie Meng, Jie An, Yong Li, Andrea Turrini, Fanjiang Xu, Naijun Zhan, Miaomiao Zhang","raw_content_length":1418,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SAT","DIP","Augmented Prefix Tree Acceptors","DFA-DIP","DFA-DIPs","DFA","Efficient Decomposition Identification of Deterministic"],"persons":["Finite Automata"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1417,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Efficient Decomposition Identification","Deterministic Finite Automata","Examples","which","arXiv250924347v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The identification","deterministic finite automata","DFAs","labeled examples"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Efficient Decomposition Identification":2.0,"Deterministic Finite Automata":2.0,"Examples":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv250924347v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The identification":1.0,"deterministic finite automata":1.0,"DFAs":1.0,"labeled examples":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7705313305555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9235,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0311,"sadness":0.0136,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0084,"disgust":0.0106},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the efficiency of identifying deterministic finite automata (DFAs) through a novel 3DFA-based approach.

This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step.

However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts.

To address this, developers usually add natural language instructions (e.g., comments) into the code context to clarify their intent. However, existing code LLMs applied for code completion systems merely undergo a fill-in-the-middle (FIM) pre-training, which struggles to leverage this information effectively due to the lack of instruction-like training data. Existing instruction-tuning techniques, improving instruction-following in general code generation, paradoxically degrades FIM performance, forcing a trade-off between instruction-following and infilling capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce Instruction-aware Fill-in-the-Middle (IFIM), an instruction-tuning method specifically designed to enhance FIM code completion models. IFIM extends the conventional FIM training objective by incorporating an explicit instruction section into the input, enabling the model to learn from (prefix, instruction, suffix) triplets. This approach allows the model to effectively leverage developer-provided directives while preserving its core completion abilities when no instructions are present. To facilitate this, we constructed a large-scale dataset by using GPT-4o to generate concise, intent-focused instructions for code infilling examples. We evaluated IFIM by applying it to two popular base models, Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder, on the benchmarks derived from HumanEval-infilling and RepoMasterEval. The results demonstrate that IFIM significantly improves instruction-following capabilities, boosting the Pass@1 score from 84.6% to 93.6%. Moreover, this enhancement does not compromise the models' original performance on FIM code completion tasks with no instructions provided.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24637","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.288616","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Zhensu Sun, Chengran Yang, Chao Peng, Pengfei Gao, Xiaoning Du, Li Li, David Lo","raw_content_length":1916,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FIM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1915,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bridging Developer Instructions","Code Completion","Instruction-Aware Fill","the code context","arXiv250924637v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Large Language Models","LLMs","significantly advanced code completion","the developers intent"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bridging Developer Instructions":2.0,"Code Completion":2.0,"Instruction-Aware Fill":2.0,"the code context":2.0,"arXiv250924637v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"significantly advanced code completion":1.0,"the developers intent":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7706091694444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9177,"joy":0.0021,"surprise":0.018,"sadness":0.0268,"fear":0.0064,"anger":0.0148,"disgust":0.0142},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving code completion using LLMs, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by making software development more efficient.

SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup).

Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \\textit{memory trigger}, which monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a \\textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to $38.22\\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties, including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24704","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.289434","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Guibin Zhang, Muxin Fu, Shuicheng Yan","raw_content_length":1578,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MemGen","\\textit{memory"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1577,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MemGen","Generative Latent Memory","Self","arXiv250924704v2","Announce Type","Abstract","Large Language Model","LLM-powered agents","the human brain","themselves"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MemGen":2.0,"Generative Latent Memory":2.0,"Self":2.0,"arXiv250924704v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Model":1.0,"LLM-powered agents":1.0,"the human brain":1.0,"themselves":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7706395294444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8981,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.0415,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0107,"anger":0.0222,"disgust":0.0154},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI framework (MemGen) that improves agent performance on benchmarks.

This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency.

Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1feba8128ec9","title":"From $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ to $f(g(x))$: LLMs Learn New Skills in RL by Composing Old Ones","content":"arXiv:2509.25123v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task.

Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings.

However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting.

An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.293167","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","csai","preprints","research","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Shenao Zhang, Donghan Yu, Yihao Feng, Bowen Jin, Zhaoran Wang, John Peebles, Zirui Wang","raw_content_length":1779,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Scalable Mid arXiv:2509.25810v3 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1778,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reason","Action Abstractions","Scalable Mid","arXiv250925810v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Large language models","reinforcement learning","this potential","a mid-training stage","An effective mid-training phase"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models","reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reason":2.0,"Action Abstractions":2.0,"Scalable Mid":2.0,"arXiv250925810v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"this potential":1.0,"a mid-training stage":1.0,"An effective mid-training phase":1.0}},"age_hours":2.770772973611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.375,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.875,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9058,"joy":0.0169,"surprise":0.0298,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0238,"anger":0.0117,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm (RA3) for improving the performance of large language models in reinforcement learning, specifically for code generation.

We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments. DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00478","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.295638","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Jing Wang, Wonho Bae, Jiahong Chen, Wenxu Wang, Junhyug Noh","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LDM","Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion","SFDA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1546,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Vicinity","arXiv251000478v2","Announce Type","Abstract","Recent work","latent diffusion models","LDMs","generative tasks","their potential","discriminative transfer"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Vicinity":2.0,"arXiv251000478v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Recent work":1.0,"latent diffusion models":1.0,"LDMs":1.0,"generative tasks":1.0,"their potential":1.0,"discriminative transfer":1.0}},"age_hours":2.770860327777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.339,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4678,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9008,"joy":0.0295,"surprise":0.0491,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0077,"disgust":0.0043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel machine learning framework (DVD) for source-free domain adaptation, potentially improving the efficiency of existing classifiers.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0f91829e8c33","title":"Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning","content":"arXiv:2510.00761v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting. Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order (gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer, such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g., gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.296053","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Yicheng Lang, Yihua Zhang, Chongyu Fan, Changsheng Wang, Jinghan Jia, Sijia Liu","raw_content_length":1958,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1957,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Downgrade","Upgrade","Optimizer Simplification","Robustness","LLM Unlearning","arXiv251000761v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Large language model","LLM unlearning aims","the influence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Unlearning","Large language model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Downgrade":2.0,"Upgrade":2.0,"Optimizer Simplification":2.0,"Robustness":2.0,"LLM Unlearning":2.0,"arXiv251000761v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large language model":1.0,"LLM unlearning aims":1.0,"the influence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7708749102777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.893,"joy":0.0082,"surprise":0.028,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0383,"anger":0.014,"disgust":0.0114},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents research on improving the robustness of LLM unlearning.

Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment. In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions.

Both of these processes are crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However, manufacturers frequently do not support these processes enough in terms of not sharing relevant data about the products nor their (re-)manufacturing processes. This paper proposes to accompany each product with a digital twin technology, specifically the Product Digital Twin (PDT), which can carry information for facilitating and optimizing production and remanufacturing processes. This paper introduces a knowledge representation called Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN). Bi-PAN extends a well-proven Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (PAN) paradigm by integrating both assembly and disassembly workflows into a single information model.

Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02266","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.298789","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Shiyi Zhang, Dong Liang, Yihang Zhou","raw_content_length":1197,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Stable Diffusion","NeuroSwift","CLIP Adapter","A Lightweight Cross","CLIP"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1196,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["NeuroSwift","A Lightweight Cross","Announce Type","Abstract","visual information","brain activity","computer vision technology","an intuitive understanding","visual neural mechanisms","progress"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["brain activity","computer vision technology"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"NeuroSwift":2.0,"A Lightweight Cross":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"visual information":1.0,"brain activity":1.0,"computer vision technology":1.0,"an intuitive understanding":1.0,"visual neural mechanisms":1.0,"progress":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7709866,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3804999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5239,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.781,"joy":0.0193,"surprise":0.0654,"sadness":0.0192,"fear":0.0937,"anger":0.014,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"NeuroSwift is a novel approach to reconstructing visual information from brain activity, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with reduced training time and computational resources.

EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02300","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.299173","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Runqian Wang, Yilun Du","raw_content_length":1172,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ImageNet","EqM","Equilibrium Matching"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1171,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Equilibrium Matching","Generative Modeling","Implicit Energy","EqM","Announce Type","Abstract","a generative modeling framework","an equilibrium dynamics perspective","the non","equilibrium time-conditional dynamics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Equilibrium Matching":3.0,"Generative Modeling":2.0,"Implicit Energy":2.0,"EqM":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a generative modeling framework":1.0,"an equilibrium dynamics perspective":1.0,"the non":1.0,"equilibrium time-conditional dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7710015194444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.634500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7269,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9007,"joy":0.0305,"surprise":0.0395,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.013,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new generative modeling framework (EqM) that achieves a specific FID score (1.90 on ImageNet 256x256).

To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\\% accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore, when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion over the constraint in up to 86\\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\\% of the time.

However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.
