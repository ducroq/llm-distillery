{"id":"science_biorxiv_3a9951e6bfd1","title":"Phagocytes as Plaque Catalysts: Human Macrophages Actively Generate Pathogenic Aβ42 Fibrils with Seeding and Cross","content":"The prevailing view frames microglia and macrophages as guardians against amyloid beta (A{beta}42) accumulation in Alzheimers disease (AD). Here, we overturn this paradigm by demonstrating that human phagocytic cells, including differentiated THP-1 macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia, are not merely passive responders but active producers of extracellular, seeding-competent A{beta}42 fibrils, the amyloid species most strongly linked to parenchymal plaque formation and neurodegeneration. These cell-generated aggregates differ structurally and functionally from synthetic fibrils, exhibiting heightened seeding activity and the ability to cross-seed tau aggregation, a key driver of AD progression. Notably, A{beta}42 fibril formation in this system requires active cellular processes and is exacerbated by loss of TREM2, a major AD risk gene. Transcriptomic profiling reveals an early inflammatory response resembling microglial states observed in human AD models, positioning this system as a tractable, human-relevant platform to dissect the interplay between A{beta} ; aggregation, innate immunity, and genetic susceptibility. Our findings suggest that macrophages and microglia play a dual role in AD, acting both as responders and inadvertent catalysts of pathogenic amyloid formation, with implications for early therapeutic intervention.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681781v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.387569","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Konstantoulea, K., Ramakers, M., Borrie, S., T'syen, D., Moechars, D., Sliwinska, M., Pradhan, B., Albertini, G., Tsaka, G., Houben, B., Fiers, M., Maarten, D., Thal, D., Michael, W., Jonas, N., De Strooper, B., Rousseau, F., Schymkowitz, J.","raw_content_length":1352,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TREM2"],"persons":[],"locations":["A{beta}42"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1352,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Phagocytes","Plaque Catalysts","Human Macrophages","Pathogenic Aβ42 Fibrils","Seeding","Cross","The prevailing view","microglia","macrophages","guardians"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["The prevailing view"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Phagocytes":2.0,"Plaque Catalysts":2.0,"Human Macrophages":2.0,"Pathogenic Aβ42 Fibrils":2.0,"Seeding":2.0,"Cross":2.0,"The prevailing view":1.0,"microglia":1.0,"macrophages":1.0,"guardians":1.0}},"age_hours":30.78685673388889,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.999499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5999,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8955,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0186,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.0262,"disgust":0.0407},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research findings that overturn the prevailing view of macrophages in Alzheimer's disease.

However, PrPSc, now known to be a simple amyloid, can just template a previously unfolded polypeptide chain. Therefore, PrPSc can easily template the disordered 90-120 domain of an incoming PrPC molecule, but not its 121-231 folded domain (FD). The FD needs to accommodate into the 121-230 PrPSc surface, an inert procrustean bed. Thus, a mechanism for concerted unfolding/refolding of the FD must exist, with FD unfolding as a key element. To explore how this might happen, we performed thermal unfolding of recombinant bank vole PrPC(90-231), that is a universal PrPSc propagator, tracking changes at the residue level with solution NMR to pinpoint early unfolding propensity. Our data suggest that a key early event is the destabilization of the short {beta}1-{beta}2 assembly, and that the segment contiguous to the disordered tail, 121-140, encompassing {beta}1 and its adjacent coils, is the most likely region to unfold first. Spectroscopic data obtained at higher temperatures suggest that portions of alpha helix 2 are likely the last elements of the FD to unfold and refold into the PrPSc conformation. Molecular Dynamics simulations assisted the interpretation of these changes and suggest separation of 1 from the rest of the FD ensemble. Our data provide a conceivable timeline of the early events in PrPSc-assisted conversion of PrPC and should serve as a starting framework to develop a future atomistic model of PrPSc propagation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681810v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.393063","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Sabzehei, S., Rigoli, M., Cacheiro, R., Diaz-Arias, I., Erana, H., Lago, R.

Bioconversion of the TOD products could be used as feedstocks in a biorefinery concept and lead to new avenues for plastic waste upcycling. Previous work demonstrated this concept with high density polyethylene (HDPE), the most abundant type of plastic, and identified the nonconventional yeast Candida maltosa as a promising candidate for this application. Here we describe the evolution of an improved strain of C. maltosa and characterize the uptake mechanisms of TOD products from HDPE (TOD_HDPE). Batch cultures in series passaged at the mid-exponential growth phase applied a selective pressure for faster growth and resulted in a >100% increase in specific growth rate when using TOD_HDPE as a carbon source. The evolved strain was compared to the parent strain to identify the cellular and biochemical changes associated with the improved phenotype and the uptake mechanisms involved in the bioconversion of TOD_HDPE. This comparison found that C. maltosa secretes biosurfactants capable of solubilizing hydrocarbons. The adaptive evolution resulted in changes in biosurfactant production that translated to improved emulsification of alkanes and increased solubilization of fatty alcohols and alkanes. In addition to the changes in metabolites, the study identified increases in membrane permeability associated with a reduction in ergosterol that may also play a role in the improved phenotype. These findings support the development of C. maltosa and other potential microbial cell factories for plastic biorefineries and may inform future design strategies.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681799v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.393453","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Rodriguez-Ocasio, E., Noroozi, K., Khalid, A., Brown, J., Brown, R.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_bd01e5232064","title":"Molecular mechanism of the key dormancy regulator DosR","content":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the etiological agent responsible for the worldwide disease Tuberculosis. DosR is recognized as the key dormancy regulator of Mtb due to its global transcriptional regulation in intracellular adaptation and long-term persistence prevailing in latent infection. However, the molecular mechanism regarding DosR-dependent transcription activation remains inadequately defined. Here, we successfully determined the cryo-EM structure of an intact DosR-dependent transcriptional activation complex (DosR-TAC), comprising Mtb RNA polymerase (RNAP), DosR, and the hypoxic promoter DNA. In DosR-TAC, two DosR monomers symmetrically dimerize through their N-terminal receiver domains (DosR_RECs) and the distinct 10 helices of the C-terminal DNA-binding domains (DosR_DBDs). Unlike its inhibitory configuration, the DosR dimer undergoes significant conformational changes within the original linker, isomerizing DosR_REC into a canonical ({beta})5 fold. This extended linker affords the DosR_DBDs and DosRI_REC to contact promoter DNA, while concurrently interacting with the conserved domains of RNAP ({sigma}AR4, CTD, and NTD). Additionally, RT-qPCR and growth curve assays of the wild-type and DosR mutant strains, also unravel the physiological importance of this divergent linker. These findings, together with prior hypotheses regarding DosR, support an allosteric activation-recruitment model for DosR. Altogether, these results highlight the molecular mechanism of DosR-dependent transcription activation critical for dormancy survival of Mtb, and offer potential targets for developing anti-dormancy strategies against persistent tuberculosis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681782v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.393760","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Shi, J., Feng, Z., Fu, H., Huang, Y., Xu, L., Song, Q., Chen, W., Feng, Y., Lyu, L., Lin, W.","raw_content_length":1678,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DosR-TAC"],"persons":["Mtb RNA","Mtb"],"locations":["Tuberculosis"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1678,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the key dormancy regulator","DosR","Molecular mechanism","Mtb","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","the etiological agent","the worldwide disease","Tuberculosis","its global transcriptional regulation","intracellular adaptation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the key dormancy regulator":3.0,"DosR":3.0,"Molecular mechanism":2.0,"Mtb":2.0,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis":1.0,"the etiological agent":1.0,"the worldwide disease":1.0,"Tuberculosis":1.0,"its global transcriptional regulation":1.0,"intracellular adaptation":1.0}},"age_hours":30.78690548333333,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9019,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0136,"sadness":0.0158,"fear":0.016,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.0278},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes basic research into the molecular mechanisms of dormancy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
