{"id":"science_biorxiv_b5edd11875e2","title":"Evolution of crop phenotypic spaces through domestication","content":"We used domestication as an in vivo replicated experiment to investigate how divergent selection has shaped the evolution of multivariate phenotypic spaces. We measured 11 to 57 qualitative and quantitative traits in 13 species, either unique or shared between species, and established a framework for cross-species comparisons. Our results revealed significant convergence that translated into a cross-species domestication syndrome. Most species exhibited a reduction of the multivariate phenotypic space during domestication. We demonstrated that Near Infrared spectra measured on leaves evolve through processes unrelated with domestication, enabling its use as a control for sampling effects across species. Building on this, we developed a multivariate Phenotypic Divergence Index (mPDI) to rank species by the extent of phenotypic divergence under domestication. We found a high disjunction of wild and domestic phenotypic spaces in all species. Neither the mPDI nor the relative size of wild versus domestic multivariate phenotypic spaces was influenced by the domestication timing or mating system. Lastly, we observed a progressive decoupling of trait correlations with increasing time since domestication. In addition to introducing a new index that can be applied across species for comparative purposes, our study uncovers recurring patterns shared among species, pointing to general principles underlying plant domestication.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681794v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.610874","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Wojcik, A., Belcram, H., Rousselet, A., Bouet, M., Brault, M., Serin, P., Desprez, A., Rincent, R., Peil, A., Henry, K., Marchal, C., Lacombe, T., Glemin, S., Alix, K., Gerard, P., Manicacci, D., Vigouroux, y., Dogimont, C., Tenaillon, M.

Displaced myonuclei are typically attributed to the activity of muscle stem cells, or satellite cells. We sought to address whether displaced myonuclei in adult skeletal muscle are exclusively from an exogenous source such as satellite cells or can result from resident myonuclear migration. To address this question, we used a murine recombination-independent muscle fibre-specific doxycycline-inducible fluorescent myonuclear labelling approach, EdU stem cell fate tracking, two durations of muscle mechanical overload (MOV, 3 days and 7 days), and fluorescent histology. Our findings show that: 1) displaced myonuclei emerge early during MOV, 2) resident myonuclear movement occurs rapidly during MOV, and 3) the contribution of resident versus exogenous displaced myonuclei depends on MOV duration, fibre type, and fibre size. These observations provide fundamental insights on myonuclear motility in response to stress in vivo and reframe our understanding of how a recognized feature of mammalian skeletal muscle can emerge in response to mechanical loading.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681647v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.611191","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Serrano, N., Koopmans, P.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ba1d22c33b29","title":"A Practical and Cost-Effective Approach to Long","content":"Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is increasingly recognised as a valuable method for assessing genetic diversity. However, its resolution and applicability are limited by the short length of sequences that can be analysed (typically < 400 bp) and high analytical costs. This study developed a practical, low-cost long-fragment eDNA analysis method using commercial full-length plasmid sequencing via a nanopore platform and evaluated its effectiveness in assessing population genetic structure. 1 L of surface water was collected from 52 sites across Hokkaido, Japan, targeting Barbatula oreas. Two mitochondrial regions (ND5 and cyt b; approximately 1,000 bp each) were species-specifically amplified, circularised, and sequenced. Library preparation took 2.5 hours, with a total cost per sample of 4,390 JPY ({approx}25.55 EUR, {approx}29.87 USD). High-quality reads were obtained from 34 samples, allowing for the reconstruction of multiple haplotypes per region through haplotype phasing. The eDNA concentration required to achieve a 50% sequencing success was within a range easily attainable for common species. Phylogenetic analysis using 62 concatenated haplotypes (1,968 bp) obtained from each sample identified two clades and multiple regional subgroups, providing higher-resolution phylogeographic information than the previous study. Furthermore, the differentiation of each clade and group was suggested to reflect geological and climatic events. These results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of long-fragment eDNA analysis for evaluating genetic diversity, and its broad application is anticipated in ecological research, conservation management, and environmental policy formulation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681776v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.611502","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Tsuji, S., Shibata, N., Yatsuyanagi, T., Fuke, Y.","raw_content_length":1707,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cost-Effective Approach"],"persons":["JPY"],"locations":["Hokkaido","Japan"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1707,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Practical and Cost-Effective Approach","Long","eDNA","a valuable method","genetic diversity","its resolution","applicability","the short length","sequences","typically 400 bp"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Practical and Cost-Effective Approach":2.0,"Long":2.0,"eDNA":1.0,"a valuable method":1.0,"genetic diversity":1.0,"its resolution":1.0,"applicability":1.0,"the short length":1.0,"sequences":1.0,"typically 400 bp":1.0}},"age_hours":30.96055011083333,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8615,"joy":0.0673,"surprise":0.014,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0157,"anger":0.0188,"disgust":0.0176},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel method for long-fragment eDNA analysis, demonstrating its feasibility in assessing genetic diversity.

It complicates treatment of many bacterial infections by contributing to treatment length, treatment failure, disease recurrence, and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Thus, blocking antibiotic recalcitrance could be a powerful strategy for improving treatment outcomes and reducing AMR rates. Here, using a forward genetic method for the isolation of antibiotic-recalcitrant mutants, we isolated two Mycobacterium smegmatis strains with mutations in the tRNA-modifying enzyme adenine-N(1)-methyltransferase. Both mutants were recalcitrant to proteostasis-perturbing antibiotics. We linked these phenotypes to upregulation of the transcriptional regulator WhiB7, highlighting its role as a point of convergence in the regulation of multiple mechanisms of antibiotic recalcitrance and resistance. Further, we identified a mechanism by which the amino acid alanine couples trans-translation to ribosome regulation-dependent, WhiB7-mediated expression of antibiotic resistance and recalcitrance genes, allowing bacterial cells to engage seemingly mutually exclusive mechanisms of survival upon exposure to stress.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681568v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.611775","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Majstorovic, A., Botella, H., Schrader, S., Lavrynchuk, Y., Chen, X., Jin, E., Taslim, J., Antoine, R., Baulard, A., Guilhot, C., Plocinski, P., Wolin, S., Vaubourgeix, J.","raw_content_length":1271,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AMR","Mycobacterium","trans Antibiotic"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1271,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Alanine dependence","trans","Antibiotic recalcitrance","a slower rate","death","either a bacterial population","a subpopulation","cells","antibiotic exposure","treatment"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["trans"],"business_innovation":["trans"],"engineering":["Antibiotic recalcitrance","antibiotic exposure"],"hydrogen_energy":["cells"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Alanine dependence":2.0,"trans":2.0,"Antibiotic recalcitrance":1.0,"a slower rate":1.0,"death":1.0,"either a bacterial population":1.0,"a subpopulation":1.0,"cells":1.0,"antibiotic exposure":1.0,"treatment":1.0}},"age_hours":30.960564051666665,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8155,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6369,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9324,"joy":0.01,"surprise":0.007,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0086,"anger":0.0104,"disgust":0.0235},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes lab research identifying a mechanism of antibiotic recalcitrance in bacteria.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c960250531fd","title":"Probability Distribution for Rare Neutral Mutations in Cancers and Application to Dynamic Precision Medicine of Cancer","content":"Cancers exhibit genetic diversity between individual cancer cells. Previous work shows greater diversity than heretofore expected (1) and that also increases more quickly during a patient's clinical course than previously thought (1, 2). Rare subclones will harbor pre-existing resistance to any single agent and may cause medium to late term relapse (1), which may evolve further variants that have simultaneous resistance to non-cross resistant therapies (3, 4). We now present a probability distribution function (PDF) of the variant allele fraction (VAF) or prevalence of a rare subclone, derived from previous evolutionary theory (1, 2). We show that current clinical sequencing protocols fail to detect the vast majority of rare subclones. By the time of detection, simultaneous multiple resistance may evolve. We then apply the PDF to simulation of dynamic precision medicine (DPM) (3), an evolutionary guided precision medicine paradigm that attempts to proactively eliminate singly-resistant subclones before they evolve multiple resistance, with significant potential to extend survival. We show that the simulated benefit of DPM with perfect information is degraded by inability to detect rare subclones if they are assumed to be absent when undetectable. But this benefit is restored if the PDF is used to calculate the likelihood of the subclone being present below the level of detection and incorporated into the DPM simulation and therapy recommendations in a probabilistic fashion. Moreover, other common statistical distributions are less effective. This theoretical advance facilitates DPM and potentially other evolutionary guided approaches to precision cancer medicine in spite of the limitations of clinical sequencing.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681641v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.612091","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"He, W., McCoy, M.

Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in tryptophan metabolism, particularly in the production of downstream metabolites such as quinolinic acid (QA), play a role in renal pathophysiology. QA is a NAD biosynthesis intermediate metabolized by the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). In this study, we investigated the role of QA in the AKI-to-CKD transition using experimental mouse models and clinical observations and leveraging multiple omics approaches. Systematic metabolomic profiling identified endogenous QA as one of the most significantly elevated metabolites following folic acid-(FA) induced injury. Exogenous QA exacerbated FA-induced kidney dysfunction. Conversely, aged mice deficient in QPRT showed worsened expression of kidney fibrosis markers even in absence of kidney injury, while younger littermates exhibited worsened induced kidney injury. Mice lacking QA-producing enzymes resisted experimental AKI and AKI-to-CKD progression. Multimodal spatial metabolomics analysis of human AKI kidney biopsies revealed QA accumulation in regions of inflammatory infiltration. Finally, children with CKD exhibited higher urinary QA levels compared to healthy controls. These findings underscore QA as a potential mediator of kidney injury and a therapeutic target for preventing the progression from AKI to CKD.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681643v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.612371","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Saade, M.

BMD pigs tended to have alterations in joint range of motion (ROM): hip (67%, 95% CI -0.64 to 14.12 degrees), knee (8%, 95% CI -17.14 to 12.13 degrees) and ankle (11%, 95% CI -15 to 8.46 degrees) ROM. While parameters were unaltered in extensor muscles, the dystrophin levels in flexor tibiotarsal joint muscles correlated with fatigue index in BMD pigs. As well as reduced isometric force (48%, 95% CI -1.86 to -0.61 N-m), and a 33% increase in fatigue index (95% CI -36.25 to 96.71 percent); the extensor muscles had no observable reductions in muscle force, with a 48% increase in fatigue index (95% CI -232.6 to 472.6 percent). Histological analysis of muscle biopsies further supported a BMD phenotype in the flexor muscles of BMD pigs, with a 75% (95% CI -55.14 to -15.66 percent) decrease in large and a 43% (95% CI 17.74 to 57.38 percent) increase in small muscle fiber cross-sectional area.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_276271e57704","title":"From spark to wildfire: illuminating single","content":"When a virus encounters a living cell it triggers infection, cell death, and the release of virus progeny. In lab cultures, such progeny spread to near and distant cells, creating a plaque, a visible record of virus growth and cell death. Plaque-based assays have long enabled amplification and quantification of virus particles, but the earliest infections of a plaque remain poorly characterized. Here, we used a recombinant rhinovirus expressing a fluorescent reporter protein to track the start and spread of infection across HeLa cell monolayers at single-cell resolution. We analyzed reporter expression profiles from eight plaques and over 150 cells, reviewing, testing and applying methods of time-series analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. We identified primary infections based on early reporter expression in isolated cells and secondary infections among their neighbors. Primary infected cells exhibited tightly clustered gene expression profiles, while secondary infected cells showed broader heterogeneity in the timing, intensity, and duration of reporter expression, without correspondence to their associated primary cells. This heterogeneity likely reflects a combination of factors, including noisy gene expression, viral genetic changes, and variation in local cellular environments. The rapid diversification of gene expression highlights the power of single-cell imaging to shed light on infection spread.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681682v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.613186","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Ramachandran, R., Shi, H., Yin, J.","raw_content_length":1443,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["HeLa"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1443,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["spark","wildfire","cell death","a plaque","a virus","a living cell","infection","the release","virus","lab cultures"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"spark":2.0,"wildfire":2.0,"cell death":2.0,"a plaque":2.0,"a virus":1.0,"a living cell":1.0,"infection":1.0,"the release":1.0,"virus":1.0,"lab cultures":1.0}},"age_hours":30.96064081833333,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.6914999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2617,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8323,"joy":0.0036,"surprise":0.0116,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0165,"anger":0.0222,"disgust":0.1057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes basic research on viral infection spread using single-cell imaging.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_87e942afab37","title":"Beak wiping stereotypies are correlated with neophobia and lack of enrichment in captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus)","content":"The existence of behavioural syndromes, or suites of correlated behaviours, means that animals may not be able to act optimally in every situation, as they can constrain plasticity. Therefore, understanding links between different behaviours is critical for understanding why animals sometimes fail to respond appropriately to environmental challenges. In this study, we assessed whether beak wiping, a stereotyped anxiety-linked behaviour where birds wipe their beaks on a perch in a ''windshield wiper'' motion, was correlated with another anxiety-linked behavior, neophobia towards novel objects presented with food, in captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We predicted that more neophobic sparrows would also exhibit more beak-wiping stereotypies. We analyzed 1 h long control videos (when sparrows were presented with a normal food dish only; n=54) from three previous neophobia studies to assess beak wiping frequency, mean beak wiping bout duration, and total bout duration. Sparrows' reluctance to feed in the presence of novel objects was significantly correlated with the mean duration of beak wiping bouts during control trials. We also found that simple enrichment (rubber perches, manzanita branch perches, and/or artificial pine branches) decreased both the frequency and duration of beak wiping. These findings suggest that neophobia and stereotypies may arise due to similar neuroendocrine mechanisms as part of a ''high anxiety'' behavioural syndrome. This work also highlights the importance of providing species-appropriate environmental enrichment to decrease the prevalence of stereotypic behaviours in captive songbirds.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681718v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.613473","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Masri, D.

While previous approaches have benchmarked individual methods such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare variant burden testing, and quantitative trait locus (QTL)-informed Mendelian randomization, it remains unclear how best to integrate these signals for drug target discovery. Here, we compared gene-prioritization strategies across 30 complex traits, evaluating their ability to recover approved drug targets compiled into lenient and moderate gold-standard sets from six curated databases. Gene-level association scores from GWAS, expression QTL, protein QTL, and exome-based analyses were integrated using five unsupervised approaches. Predictive performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and enrichment-based statistics. Across traits, GWAS alone ranked known drug targets on average ~652 ranks (3.42%) above random expectation, and the minimum-rank-based integration strategy provided an improvement of further ~558 positions (2.93%), achieving the best AUROC in 23 of 30 traits. When comparing genetic correlation and drug target overlap across trait pairs, we observed a significant positive association (r = 0.193; p = 5.46e-5), and cross-trait analyses further revealed that prioritization scores derived from related diseases could at times equal or even surpass a trait's own performance. For instance, coronary artery disease data improved the prediction of stroke targets (p = 0.004), while inflammatory bowel disease data enhanced the prioritization of chronic kidney disease targets (p = 0.014). Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrating complementary genetic signals through a minimum-rank-based framework, combined with information from genetically related traits, systematically strengthens drug target identification across complex diseases.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681636v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.614019","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Moix, S., Sadler, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_471b5204d8dd","title":"Tracking the evolutionary trajectory of a young hybrid plant pathogen","content":"A common mechanism by which emerging plant pathogens gain the ability to infect new hosts is hybridization. Despite its widespread occurrence, the outcomes of hybridization remain largely unpredictable within current evolutionary frameworks, making empirical studies key for identifying patterns and establishing principles underlying hybrid evolution. Here, we track the evolutionary trajectory of Blumeria graminis forma specialis triticale (B.g. triticale), or triticale powdery mildew, a pathogen that emerged recently through hybridization of two powdery mildew forms specialized on wheat (B.g. tritici) and rye (B.g. secalis). Using a genomic dataset of 652 isolates from the three formae speciales, we show that they persist as three isolated lineages. Results from our infection assays and sampling suggest that B.g. triticale is not well adapted to infect wheat under field conditions, indicating that isolation between B.g. tritici and B.g. triticale may be maintained by partial niche separation. We investigated the genomic changes following hybridization and found that at least a third of the hybrid genome is fixed for B.g. tritici ancestry in contemporary populations, and around 1% is fixed for the B.g. secalis ancestry. We identified several loci to be under recent positive selection in B.g. triticale, most of which coincide with known genes and regions of fixed or nearly fixed local ancestry. Overall, we highlight the role of ecological isolation in preventing gene flow between B.g. triticale and its parental lineages. We reveal the rapid stabilization of its genome after hybridization and show that some of these changes were likely shaped by selection.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681615v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.614329","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Jigisha, J., Piechota, U., Czembor, P., Bencze, S., Cseplo, M., Lopes, M.

We resolved the origin of ligands and the cells that express their respective receptors for four major signaling pathways that have been previously implicated in bladder development, SHH, BMP, WNT and FGF. The transcription factor Odd-skipped related 1 is essential for mesenchymal differentiation during organogenesis of the foregut, kidney, limb, ureter and many others. We demonstrate that Osr1 is required for proper development of the bladder, with homozygous loss of Osr1 affecting all layers of the bladder including depletion of smooth muscle, loss of extracellular matrix, loss of suburothelial cells, and less stratified epithelia lacking intermediate and superficial cells. Transcripts within all four signaling pathways were largely decreased during cellular diversification in the bladder suggesting that Osr1 is a central mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk during this crucial stage of bladder development.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.680757v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.614595","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Murugapoopathy, V., Gupta, I.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_e5b8457acef0","title":"Oscillatory and elevated flow distinctly regulate gene expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells","content":"Objective: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality globally. Atherosclerosis develops at arterial sites exposed to disturbed, low, or oscillatory shear stress, while acute coronary syndromes-triggered by plaque rupture or erosion predominantly occurs in regions subjected to elevated shear stress. The response of endothelial cells to disturbed flow has received significant attention, however, the response to elevated flow is less well studied. We addressed this shortfall by providing a comprehensive analysis of mRNA, microRNA and proteome expression in primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) cultured under different flow environments and identify novel changes in gene expression that may play a role in promoting both atherogenesis and plaque erosion. Approach and Results: We conducted a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of HCAECs cultured for 72 hours under oscillatory shear stress (OSS), physiological laminar shear stress (LSS), and elevated shear stress (ESS). Our results identified 2,175 shear-regulated genes, with 1,218 uniquely responsive to OSS and 665 to ESS. Both OSS and ESS induced significant changes in RNA isoform selection, affecting 580 and 848 genes respectively. Signalling pathways regulating CAD pathogenesis including HIPPO, TGF?/BMP, and IRF, showed altered RNA isoform selection which may influence plaque development and plaque erosion. 65% of LD-filtered CAD-associated genetic variants from two recent multi-population meta-analyses contained at least one OSS or ESS-regulated gene within 250Kb. Proteomic analysis identified 289 proteins differentially expressed under OSS and 171 under ESS, with notable discordance between mRNA and protein changes observed in 28.7% (OSS vs LSS) and 16.6% (ESS vs LSS) genes. Additionally, 40 shear-responsive microRNAs were identified, potentially contributing this discordance. Conclusion: Both oscillatory and elevated flow trigger distinct HCAEC gene expression programmes, affecting mRNA, microRNA, splicing, and protein expression, modulating pathways central to CAD pathogenesis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681055v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.614899","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":287,"author":"Vidotto, G., Luzzi, S., Humphries, J., Beal, R., McVey, D.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_7beceb6fc456","title":"Reducing Reactive Lipids Improves Cardiac Metabolic and Diastolic Function in Pulmonary Hypertension Models","content":"Background: Reactive oxygen species are increased across most pulmonary hypertension (PH) etiologies, resulting in increased reactive lipid dicarbonyls, which form protein adducts and impair mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that reducing reactive lipids would reduce right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and improve cardiac function by eliminating protein-lipid damage feedback loops. Methods: We used 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) to scavenge reactive lipids in three complimentary mouse models of PH: AKR-high fat diet (HFD, metabolic stress), LNAME-HFD (cardiometabolic syndrome), and pulmonary artery banding (PAB, load stress). Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography and catheterization. RV energy metabolism was determined by oxygraphy. Mass spectrometry analyzed lipids and ceramides; O-link and RNA-Seq evaluated proteomic and gene expression in lungs, RV, and LV. Results: Reducing reactive lipids with 2-HOBA resulted in a ~10% reduction in RVSP, reduced diastolic dysfunction, reduced plasma lipids and ceramides, and normalized RV fatty acid oxidation that was severely impaired in the AKR-HFD and PAB models. Proteomic and RNA changes in the lungs, RV, and LV suggested reduced oxidative damage and inflammatory signaling and altered developmental and actin organization signaling; these changes are plausibly associated with the improved adaptation. Some changes were sex specific, including a 4x higher cardiac fatty acid content in males than females. Conclusions: Reactive lipid scavenging improves cardiac metabolic and diastolic function and pulmonary vascular resistance through restoration of mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative protein damage. The magnitude of hemodynamic improvement combined with substantial diastolic function improvement suggests clinical potential, particularly for PH patients with metabolic comorbidities.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681763v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.615218","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"West, J., Moore, C., Gladson, S., Shay, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_54a42afa9e4c","title":"Mating","content":"Fungal species are typically either fully self-fertile or self-sterile, but some filamentous ascomycetes can commonly transition from self-fertility to self-sterility through unidirectional mating-type switching. In these fungi, the structure of the mating-type (MAT1) locus governs sexual behaviour: MAT-2 self-fertile individuals retain both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genes, while MAT-1 self-sterile isolates lose MAT1-2 genes during switching. A third type of isolate morphology also occurs under laboratory conditions: these are self-sterile isolates which retain both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, but are unable to switch mating type. These are commonly referred to as MAT-2 self-sterile isolates. Two of the mating-type (MAT) genes, one of which is deleted during switching, encode transcription factors known to regulate not only the sexual cycle but also genes unrelated to mating. To test how MAT1 structural variations affects gene expression, we studied Ceratocystis albifundus, a species that switches mating type. To minimise variability caused by intraspecific genetic differences, two self-sterile isolates (MAT-1 and MAT-2 self-steriles) were derived from the same MAT-2 self-fertile parent, making all three isolates genetically identical except at the MAT1 locus. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that the MAT-2 self-fertile, MAT-1 self-sterile and MAT-2 self-sterile isolates all exhibited distinct expression patterns, including differences in MAT genes, the pheromonereceptor pathway, and other genes not directly linked to mating. The results show that MAT1 locus structure influences gene expression more broadly than those only related to the sexual cycle.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681704v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.616131","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Lane, F.

It presents 5'- and 3'-long terminal repeats (LTR) that are enriched in putative G-quadruplex (G4)-forming sequences. G4s are non-canonical nucleic acid structures that regulate key biological processes in both human and viral genomes. We here investigated the presence and functional role of G4s within the HTLV-1 3'-LTR, which governs the antisense transcription of the viral bZIP factor (HBZ), the main responsible for T-cell transformation. We identified seven highly conserved sequences that folded into two-layer G4s in both single- and double-stranded DNA in vitro. We demonstrated G4 folding in infected cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation and showed SP1 enrichment at the 3'-LTR G4s. We showed that G4 stabilization with a ligand enhances antisense transcription by promoting recruitment of SP1. Our findings unveil a G4-mediated regulatory mechanism sustaining HTLV-1 antisense transcription and provide new insights into the complex interplay between the HTLV-1 genome and host cellular factors, contributing to our understanding of retroviral replication strategies to be exploited as new therapeutic targets.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681801v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.616663","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Richter, S.

In this study, we developed a mechanistic understanding of the VapBC12-dependent modulation of growth and antibiotic susceptibility in M. tuberculosis. We identified a unique Cholesterol Recognition Amino acid Consensus (CRAC) motif in VapC12 toxin and demonstrated that its heterologous expression induces toxicity in M. smegmatis. We have solved the crystal structure of VapB12 antitoxin at a 1.6A0 wavelength and using molecular modeling predicted the structure of TA complex. Structure-function analysis revealed specific residues critical for the assembly and activity of the VapBC12 TA system. Our study suggests that cholesterol activates the VapC12 toxin by competitively displacing its cognate antitoxin at the CRAC motif which consequently restricts the growth of M. tuberculosis. Finally, we demonstrated that chemical inhibition of VapC12 prevents growth restriction and potentiates activity of anti-TB drugs.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681325v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.616927","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Hashmi, Z., Singh, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ccaeb9e230a9","title":"Effects of dipicolinic acid on Bacillus anthracis spore biology and cytotoxicity","content":"Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that causes lethal inhalation anthrax. The use of B. anthracis as a bioweapon is predicated in its ability to form dormant and resistant infective spores that can be used as agents. B. anthracis spores contain large concentrations of dipicolinic acid complexed with cations, especially calcium (Ca-DPA). Following phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, spores germinate inside the phagolysosome and excrete the Ca-DPA depot into the phagosomal space. In this study, we assessed the effects of DPA on B. anthracis spore biology and cytotoxicity. We generated B. anthracis mutants with defects in DPA synthesis ({Delta}spoVFA, {Delta}spoVFB, {Delta}spoVFAB) or transport ({Delta}spoVV). To increase the viability of DPA-less spores, we also constructed double mutants ({Delta}sleB{Delta}spoVFA, {Delta}sleB{Delta}spoVFB, {Delta}sleB{Delta}spoVFAB and {Delta}sleB{Delta}spoVV) by deleting the cortex lytic sleB gene. We found that single- and double-mutant DPA-less spores were profoundly compromised in dormancy, viability, germination, and heat resistance. Contrary to expectations, each DPA synthesis mutant exhibited distinct viability and resistance phenotypes. Even with compromised stability, DPA-less B. anthracis spores, with the exception of the {Delta}sleB{Delta}spoVV double mutant, were as cytotoxic as wild-type spores. In summary, DPA is required to sustain normal B. anthracis spore biology but is not required for macrophage-targeted virulence. Furthermore, the SpoVV transporter and SleB lytic protein seem to have redundant roles in anthrax spore cytotoxicity beyond DPA accumulation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681759v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.617241","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Hassan-Casarez, C., Mata, T.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_22f70751fad2","title":"Early menopause is associated with reduced global brain activity","content":"Menopause affects the aging process in women through significant ovarian hormone production decline in midlife. Women who experience early menopause face an accelerated physiological aging rate, along with impaired memory and increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains elusive how the timing of menopause affects brain activity, which could be crucial for understanding menopause-related acceleration of aging and increased risk of dementia. Recent studies have revealed a highly structured infra-slow (< 0.1 Hz) global brain activity across species and linked it to arousal and memory functions, as well as waste clearance in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). In this study, we examined how this global brain activity relates to age of menopause using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project-Aging dataset. We found that women who experienced earlier menopause (mean menopausal age 45{+/-}3.5 yr) exhibited weaker global brain activity (p = 5.0x10-4) with reduced coupling to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow (p = 0.017) compared to age-matched later-menopausal women (mean menopausal age 54{+/-}1.2 yr). Differences appeared mainly in higher-order brain regions, where activation levels correlated with memory performance in earlier but not in intermediate or later menopausal women. These findings highlight brain activity changes linked to early menopause, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying memory decline and the increased risk of AD and dementias in early-onset menopausal women.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681622v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.617530","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Liu, X., Liu, X., Luo, L., Pritschet, L., Mao, Y., Han, F., Proctor, D.","raw_content_length":1528,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Human Connectome Project-Aging","Menopause"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1528,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Early menopause","reduced global brain activity","Menopause","the aging process","women","significant ovarian hormone production decline","midlife","Women","who","early menopause"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["reduced global brain activity"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Early menopause":2.0,"reduced global brain activity":2.0,"Menopause":1.0,"the aging process":1.0,"women":1.0,"significant ovarian hormone production decline":1.0,"midlife":1.0,"Women":1.0,"who":1.0,"early menopause":1.0}},"age_hours":30.960862669444445,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5056,"joy":0.0031,"surprise":0.0496,"sadness":0.0699,"fear":0.3414,"anger":0.0121,"disgust":0.0182},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research findings on the correlation between early menopause and reduced global brain activity.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_4f8e8007beaf","title":"Challenging the loss of complexity theory: insights from the neuromuscular system in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","content":"Background: According to the \"loss of complexity\" theory, aging and disease are expected to reduce complexity of physiological outputs, thereby limiting the system's adaptability. However, it remains unclear whether this concept applies to the neuromuscular system in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (pwCOPD). This study aimed to challenge the loss of complexity hypothesis by assessing the regularity, as well as the steadiness and the accuracy, of force production during submaximal isometric contractions in pwCOPD compared to healthy individuals. Methods: Seventeen pwCOPD and seventeen age- and sex-matched healthy participants performed submaximal isometric contractions of the knee extensors at six target forces, ranging from 10 to 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Regularity of force signals was assessed using sample entropy (SampEn) and percentage of determinism (DET) from the recurrence quantification analysis. Steadiness and accuracy were quantified using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE), respectively. Results: PwCOPD exhibited 26.5% lower MVC than healthy individuals. Despite this muscular weakness, no significant main effect of group or interaction effect (group x contraction intensity) was observed for SampEn, DET, CV and RMSE, suggesting a preserved force control in pwCOPD at all assessed force levels. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the loss of complexity theory may not apply in moderate COPD, at least for the neuromuscular system. These findings suggest that neuromuscular alteration associated with COPD may not be sufficient to impair the complexity of force output, questioning the universality of the loss of complexity theory.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681623v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.617827","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Chatain, C., Ramdani, S., Paleiron, N., Cucchietti Waltz, F., Jobic, A., Vallier, J.-M., Gruet, M.","raw_content_length":1742,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MVC"],"persons":["Background"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1742,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the loss","the neuromuscular system","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","complexity theory","insights","complexity","Background","aging","disease","physiological outputs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the loss":3.0,"the neuromuscular system":3.0,"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease":3.0,"complexity theory":2.0,"insights":2.0,"complexity":2.0,"Background":1.0,"aging":1.0,"disease":1.0,"physiological outputs":1.0}},"age_hours":30.960876886666664,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.408,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7184,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7421,"joy":0.0143,"surprise":0.0413,"sadness":0.0201,"fear":0.1283,"anger":0.0298,"disgust":0.0241},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the neuromuscular system in COPD patients, challenging the 'loss of complexity' theory.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ee0cd52e1773","title":"Statistical thermodynamics based design principles into the temperature induced fold switching of a metamorphic protein","content":"Fold-switching metamorphic protein sequences defy the classical 'one sequence-one fold' paradigm. The ability of metamorphic proteins to reversibly switch between distinct folds make them attractive de novo protein engineering candidates since they can function as environment-sensitive molecular switches. However, the underlying thermodynamic design principles that drive their fold-switching behaviour is poorly understood. Gaining insights into the molecular driving forces leading to fold switching behavior is crucial for the rational design of new metamorphic proteins based molecular switches, sensors and stimulus responsive nanomaterials. In this study, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a designed fold-switching protein [PNAS 2023,120 (4), e2215418120] that transitions between a 3 fold and /{beta} fold upon changes in temperature. We use an efficient advanced sampling molecular simulation based free energy calculation approach called Confine-Desolvate-Convert-Solvate-Release (CDCSR), which subjects the protein through the complete range of thermodynamic cycle and deconvolutes the enthalpic and entropic driving forces at each stage of the cycle. We find that while 3 fold is stabilized at low temperatures by enthalpic contributions from favorable water-water and protein-water interactions, the transition to the /{beta} fold at high temperatures is driven by the gain of entropy from the release of ordered water molecules surrounding the 3 fold. Our study elucidates the molecular driving forces governing temperature-induced fold-switching behavior and provides a rigorous statistical thermodynamic framework that can help in the design and engineering of future synthetic and functional metamorphic proteins.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.679401v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.618135","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Parui, S., Srivastava, A.","raw_content_length":1746,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["de novo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1746,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Statistical thermodynamics","design principles","the temperature","induced fold switching","a metamorphic protein","Fold-switching metamorphic protein sequences","the classical one sequence-one fold paradigm","The ability","metamorphic proteins","distinct folds"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Statistical thermodynamics":2.0,"design principles":2.0,"the temperature":2.0,"induced fold switching":2.0,"a metamorphic protein":2.0,"Fold-switching metamorphic protein sequences":1.0,"the classical one sequence-one fold paradigm":1.0,"The ability":1.0,"metamorphic proteins":1.0,"distinct folds":1.0}},"age_hours":30.960891315,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8708,"joy":0.0157,"surprise":0.0431,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.013,"anger":0.026,"disgust":0.0275},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into the thermodynamic principles behind metamorphic proteins, which could potentially be used to create environment-sensitive molecular switches.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_242d82ed7c23","title":"Multiple protein","content":"The assembly of enveloped viruses is a highly orchestrated process that depends on the coupling of multiple protein-protein interactions within a membrane environment. To gain mechanistic insight into this process, we use Chikungunya virus as a model system to study Alphavirus assembly, focusing on the interplay between core-spike and spike-spike interactions. We begin with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically explore how the symmetry of the nucleocapsid core, together with the relative strengths of spike-core and spike-spike interactions, influences budding efficiency and the emergence of icosahedral particle symmetry. Building on these computational predictions, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on Chikungunya virus 181/25 and examine the consequences for particle assembly and budding in cultured cells, as well as the impact of these mutations during in-cellulo assembly. Our results reveal that canonical core-spike interactions, while necessary, are not sufficient for successful assembly. Instead, lateral interactions among glycoproteins emerge as critical determinants of efficient budding, particle stability, and the maintenance of icosahedral symmetry. Together, these findings provide an integrated computational and experimental framework for understanding the molecular principles governing Alphavirus assembly.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681735v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.618657","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Coronado-Ipina, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_eb9d472061d1","title":"Generative design of antibody Fc","content":"Beyond antigen recognition, antibodies direct diverse immune effector functions through their constant (Fc) domain. While the Fc domain is central to antibody biology and therapeutic efficacy, our understanding of how Fc sequence encodes function remains limited, as most of Fc sequence space has not been experimentally mapped or linked to Fc-receptor engagement. Furthermore, the extensive overlap in Fc-receptor binding sites on the Fc domain has impeded efforts to engineer antibodies with tailored, multi-receptor engagement profiles that can precisely control downstream immunity. Here we introduce a novel framework for Fc engineering that integrates protein engineering with deep learning to rationally predict and engineer antibody Fc function. Using a yeast-based, aglycosylated Fc display system, we performed deep mutational scanning across the entire human IgG1 Fc domain, allowing the rational design of a diverse combinatorial library of more than 108 Fc-variants. This library was sorted based on binding to a panel of eight canonical Fc-receptors, and the resulting populations were deep sequenced to generate a high-quality dataset comprising millions of unique Fc sequences annotated with their respective Fc-receptor binding profiles. Deep learning-based classifiers trained on this dataset accurately predicted Fc-receptor binding activity from Fc sequence across all Fc-receptors tested. We further developed FcGPT, a domain-specific autoregressive protein language model pre-trained on over three million unique Fc sequences, and refined by post-training through reinforcement learning with experimental feedback (RLXF) and synthetic verifiers. FcGPT enables the computational design of novel Fc-variants with user-defined Fc-receptor binding profiles, providing a foundational tool for understanding and programming antibody-mediated immunity.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681689v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.618954","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Irvine, E.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ec2dd96c38b3","title":"A mathematical model of osteocyte network control of bone mechanical adaptation","content":"The osteocyte network embedded in bone tissues plays a central role in the control of bone adaptation to mechanical loads and micro-damage repair. However, much remains to be understood about the precise mechanisms by which the osteocyte network regulates bone formation and bone resorption based on the propagation of biochemical signals emitted in response to mechanical stimulus. In this work, we propose a simple one-dimensional computational model of bone mechanical adaptation based on the propagation of signalling molecules through a dynamic osteocyte network. The osteocyte network is extended during bone formation, and reduced during bone resorption, which affects the generation and propagation of the signalling molecules to the bone surface. We explore how this osteocyte-based model of bone mechanosensation and mechanoresponse gives rise to effective Wolff's laws, in which overloaded bone is consolidated and underloaded bone is removed. We find that the pointwise addition and removal of osteocytes significantly affects signalling molecules propagating to the bone surface, which in turn affects the dynamics of bone formation and bone resorption. The explicit consideration of signal propagation through a dynamic network leads to new behaviours compared to previous models, such as partial bone recovery after an unloading and reloading cycle, and a minimum loading threshold below which all bone is resorbed when osteocytes are stimulated by mechanical stress (but not when they are stimulated by the strain energy density). While many extensions of this mathematical model are possible, it provides a first illustration of how the osteocyte network can act as a dynamic embedded control network for bone adaptation to mechanical loads.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681578v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:36:22.619265","language":"en","tags":["biology","cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Mehrpooya, A., Challis, V.
