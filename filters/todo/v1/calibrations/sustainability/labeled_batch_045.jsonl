The proposed system integrates a monocular camera, an infrared laser distance sensor with a galvanometer scanner, and a customized deep learning detector based on an improved YOLOv11 model. In operation, the vision subsystem first detects the approximate image location of the torch tip using the YOLOv11-based model. Guided by this detection, the galvanometer steers the IR laser beam to that point and measures the distance to the torch tip. The distance feedback is then fused with the vision coordinates to compute the precise 3D position of the torch tip in real-time. Under complex illumination, the proposed YLGS system exhibits superior robustness compared with color-marker and ArUco baselines. Experimental evaluation shows that the system outperforms traditional color-marker and ArUco-based methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and processing speed. This marker-free method provides high-precision torch positioning without requiring structured lighting or artificial markers. Its pedagogical implications in engineering education are also discussed. Potential future work includes extending the method to full 6-DOF pose estimation and integrating additional sensors for enhanced performance.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6279","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.927509","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Wei Wei","raw_content_length":1391,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["YOLO","LaserGalvo"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["ArUco"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1381,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["YOLO","LaserGalvo","Sensors","Pages","A Vision","Laser","YLGS","precise localization","torch tips","industrial welding automation"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["industrial welding automation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"YOLO":3.0,"LaserGalvo":3.0,"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Vision":2.0,"Laser":2.0,"YLGS":1.0,"precise localization":1.0,"torch tips":1.0,"industrial welding automation":1.0}},"age_hours":18.727541653333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9042,"joy":0.0129,"surprise":0.0464,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.0118,"anger":0.0129,"disgust":0.008},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel system for precise welding torch tip localization, potentially improving automation and efficiency in industrial welding.

To enhance the accuracy of soil parameter selection in finite element simulation and improve the precision of finite element analysis, an inversion method for soil parameters based on a PSO-SVM model is proposed. In this method, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to optimize the penalty parameter C and kernel function parameter g of the support vector machine (SVM) model. The optimized PSO-SVM model is employed to establish a nonlinear mapping relationship between the horizontal displacements of retaining structures in deep excavations and soil parameters through orthogonal experimental design and finite element simulation analysis. Subsequently, soil parameters are inverted from monitoring data of horizontal displacements of retaining structures, and the reliability of the parameters is verified. The deformation of the retaining structures during subsequent cases is then predicted. The results demonstrate that the absolute error of the peak maximum horizontal displacements of the retaining structures after inversion is maintained within 1 mm. The maximum relative error is reduced from 18.96% before inversion to 7.63%, indicating that the inverted soil parameters for the deep excavation possess high accuracy. The precision of the finite element simulation for deep excavation is significantly improved, effectively reflecting the actual mechanical properties of the soil during the construction stage. The inverted parameters can be used for the prediction of subsequent retaining structure deformation. During subsequent construction conditions, the predicted maximum horizontal displacement (deformation) of the retaining structure at monitoring point CX1 is 15.66 mm, and that at monitoring point CX2 is predicted to be 14.22 mm. Neither value exceeds the project warning threshold of 30.00 mm.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6281","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.927833","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":270,"author":"Hongyou Cao","raw_content_length":1906,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.35,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PSO"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1906,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PSO","Sensors","Pages","Inversion","Soil Parameters","Deformation Prediction","Deep Excavation","deep excavation","actual soil parameters","changes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PSO":3.0,"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Inversion":2.0,"Soil Parameters":2.0,"Deformation Prediction":2.0,"Deep Excavation":2.0,"deep excavation":1.0,"actual soil parameters":1.0,"changes":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72755780611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.453999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6908,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9026,"joy":0.0074,"surprise":0.0178,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0126,"anger":0.0243,"disgust":0.0281},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a method to improve the accuracy of soil parameter selection for deep excavation projects, leading to more precise finite element simulations.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_ca20659edb49","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6282: Estimating Sleep","content":"Accurate assessment of sleep architecture is critical for diagnosing and managing sleep disorders, which significantly impact global health and well-being. While polysomnography (PSG) remains the clinical gold standard, its inherent intrusiveness, high cost, and logistical complexity limit its utility for routine or home-based monitoring. Recent advances highlight that subtle variations in respiratory dynamics, such as respiratory rate and cycle regularity, exhibit meaningful correlations with distinct sleep stages and could serve as valuable non-invasive biomarkers. In this work, we propose a framework for estimating sleep stage distribution—specifically Wake, Light (N1+N2), Deep (N3), and REM—based on respiratory audio captured over a single sleep episode. The framework comprises three principal components: (1) a segmentation module that identifies distinct respiratory cycles in respiratory sounds using a fine-tuned Transformer-based architecture; (2) a feature extraction module that derives a suite of statistical, spectral, and distributional descriptors from these segmented respiratory patterns; and (3) stage-specific regression models that predict the proportion of time spent in each sleep stage. Experiments on the public PSG-Audio dataset (287 subjects; mean 5.3 h per subject), using subject-wise cross-validation, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The segmentation model achieved lower RMSE and MAE in predicting respiratory rate and cycle duration, outperforming classical signal-processing baselines. For sleep stage proportion prediction, the proposed method yielded favorable RMSE and MAE across all stages, with the TabPFN model consistently delivering the best results. By quantifying interpretable respiratory features and intentionally avoiding black-box end-to-end modeling, our system may support transparent, contact-free sleep monitoring using passive audio.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6282","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.928227","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Minsam Ko","raw_content_length":1935,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Transformer","REM"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1915,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Sleep","Accurate assessment","sleep architecture","sleep disorders","which","global health","well-being","polysomnography"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Sleep":2.0,"Accurate assessment":1.0,"sleep architecture":1.0,"sleep disorders":1.0,"which":1.0,"global health":1.0,"well-being":1.0,"polysomnography":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72757338138889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9256,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0156,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0241,"anger":0.0082,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework for estimating sleep stage distribution using respiratory audio.

This study presents a fast, objective, and non-invasive method for detecting OSA severity by analyzing tracheal breathing sounds (TBS) recorded during wakefulness in supine position. Features were extracted from six binary (1-vs-1) severity comparisons—Non-OSA, Mild, Moderate, and Severe—and combined with anthropometric characteristics for classification. The data of 199 subjects (74 Non-OSA, 35 Mild, 50 Moderate, and 40 Severe) were analyzed, the data of 169 and 30 was used for training and blind testing, respectively, and the training dataset was shuffled 10 times to avoid any bias during training. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated, and the best-performing model for each was saved. Across six experimental models comparing OSA severity levels, the most balanced performance was achieved by the Base Model of Non-OSA vs. Severe-OSA using the support vector machine algorithm, with 88.2% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity, and 90.9% specificity. While Random Forests in the Base Model of Non-OSA vs. Mild-OSA achieved 100% sensitivity, its accuracy was lower (81.2%).

Perkins Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process orchestrated by diverse cell populations within a dynamic niche. In response to muscle damage and intercellular signaling, these cells undergo cell fate and migration decisions including quiescence, activation, proliferation, differentiation, infiltration, apoptosis, and exfiltration. The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies of muscle regeneration offers a significant opportunity to refine models of regeneration and enhance our understanding of cellular interactions. To better understand how crosstalk between cell types governs cell fate decisions and cell population dynamics, we developed a novel non-linear ordinary differential equation model guided by scRNA-seq data. Our model consists of 9 variables and 17 parameters, capturing the dynamics of key myogenic lineage and immune cell types. We calibrated time-series scRNA-seq data to units of cells per cubic millimeter of tissue and fit our model’s parameters to capture the observed dynamics, validating on an independent time series. The model successfully captures key features of regeneration dynamics, particularly after incorporating a novel regulatory interaction between M2 macrophages and satellite cells that has been hypothesized in the literature.

Goodman The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change throughout our lifetime. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate our sound localisation circuit. This is often thought of as a “supervised” learning process where a “teacher” (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your localiser. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range sound localiser. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and provide examples in which these mechanisms can interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signals. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial hearing.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013543","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:54.621397","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Dan F.

Tachyplesin I (TP-I), a β-sheet antimicrobial peptide isolated from horseshoe crab hemocytes, is known for its broad-spectrum activity but is limited by the presence of cysteine-rich disulfide bonds. In this study, we evaluated two synthetic analogs: CDT (Cysteine-Deleted Tachyplesin I) and CRDT (Cysteine- and Arginine-Deleted Tachyplesin Analog), designed to simplify the structure and reduce production cost while maintaining or enhancing bioactivity. The antimicrobial efficacy of CDT and CRDT was assessed against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa through minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays. CRDT demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity, with enhanced membrane-disruptive effects visualized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), especially in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between CRDT and key QS regulators—SarA in S. aureus, and LasR in P. aeruginosa—supporting its ability to interfere with bacterial communication systems, while qRT-PCR analysis showed significant downregulation of QS-related genes (agrA, sarA, hla, algD and pelA). These findings suggest that CRDT not only exhibits direct bactericidal activity but also interferes with QS-mediated communication, making it a promising candidate for the development of dual-action antimicrobial therapeutics targeting both bacterial viability and virulence.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334547","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.929938","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Nitaya Indrawattana","raw_content_length":1851,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Antimicrobial","CDT","Staphylococcus","Nitaya Indrawattana","MIC","CRDT"],"persons":["CDT","Pisinee Aiumurai","Sirijan Santajit","Pseudomonas","Nawannaporn Saelim","Tachyplesin","Thapani Srisai"],"locations":["Chaicumpa","Thavorasak","Thida Kong-Ngoen"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1759,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Antimicrobial and quorum sensing interference","a cysteine","Sirijan Santajit","Techit Thavorasak","Thida Kong-Ngoen","Nawannaporn Saelim","Thapani Srisai","Pisinee Aiumurai","Wanpen Chaicumpa","The rise"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Thapani Srisai"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Antimicrobial and quorum sensing interference":2.0,"a cysteine":2.0,"Sirijan Santajit":1.0,"Techit Thavorasak":1.0,"Thida Kong-Ngoen":1.0,"Nawannaporn Saelim":1.0,"Thapani Srisai":1.0,"Pisinee Aiumurai":1.0,"Wanpen Chaicumpa":1.0,"The rise":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734569598888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8094,"joy":0.0279,"surprise":0.0135,"sadness":0.0133,"fear":0.0418,"anger":0.0257,"disgust":0.0683},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents research on a novel antimicrobial peptide analog (CRDT) with demonstrated efficacy against drug-resistant bacteria.

This research uses machine learning models to examine the main causes of obesity, in contrast to standard information that typically rely on a single chance. The important fat-related steps were identified and ranked in this assessment to provide information on the effectiveness of the expected solutions. Methods Data from the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) were used in a cross-sectional analysis of adolescents aged 12–18 years. Random Forest and XGBoost models were implemented to investigate behavioral, dietary, sleep, and substance use factors. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Results Breakfast frequency, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) days, sleep duration, fruit intake, and screen time emerged as the most important predictors of obesity, with vaping also contributing to risk. Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 66.4% and XGBoost 66.3%, both with modest discriminative ability (AUC ~ 0.58). Fewer MVPA days, lower breakfast frequency, shorter sleep duration, lower fruit intake, and longer screen time were associated with increased obesity risk. SHAP analysis confirmed breakfast frequency and MVPA days as the top-ranked factors. Conclusion Machine learning models identified key predictors of adolescent obesity, providing insights into the complex interplay of behavioral and lifestyle factors. Public health strategies should prioritize daily breakfast and fruit consumption, regular physical activity, sufficient sleep, reduced screen time, and vaping prevention to mitigate rising obesity rates among adolescents.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334502","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.930528","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Jin Yan","raw_content_length":1831,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["XGBoost","SHapley Additive exPlanations (","Random Forest","Methods Data","MVPA"],"persons":["Tianyuan Hou","Yuhai Peng","Songjian Du","Zehan Xu","Jin Yan Background"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1796,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SHAP","obesity","Yuhai Peng","Zehan Xu","Songjian Du","Tianyuan Hou","Jin Yan Background","The growing prevalence","adolescents","the world"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Yuhai Peng"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SHAP":2.0,"obesity":2.0,"Yuhai Peng":1.0,"Zehan Xu":1.0,"Songjian Du":1.0,"Tianyuan Hou":1.0,"Jin Yan Background":1.0,"The growing prevalence":1.0,"adolescents":1.0,"the world":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734584909166666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.648999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1298,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8264,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0329,"sadness":0.0168,"fear":0.0766,"anger":0.0234,"disgust":0.018},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research uses machine learning to identify key predictors of adolescent obesity, focusing on modifiable lifestyle factors.

If left untreated, this condition may result in severe health consequences, including death. Accurate detection and classification are the essential steps toward understanding their mechanisms and ensuring effective treatment. Both tasks are challenging, with brain tumor detection being more complex due to variations in tumor size, structure, and location. Many scholars have employed machine learning and deep learning methods for brain tumor detection. Deep learning (DL) methods provide robust solutions for the detection and classification of brain tumors. Large volumes of healthcare imaging data can be analyzed using these techniques to identify and characterize tumors with high accuracy, often surpassing human performance. In this study, we propose two deep learning models, a novel customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an optimized ResNet101, to classify brain tumor images into four categories: gliomas, pituitary tumors, meningiomas, and no tumor. We used an MRI image dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 3,264 images. We performed five-fold cross-validation on the training and validation set, and a separate test set was used for final evaluation. The average training accuracy across the five-fold was 99.03±0.01% for the novel customized CNN and 99.87±0.03% for optimized ResNet101, and the average validation accuracy was 96.31±0.01% and 97.23±0.03%, respectively. After the cross-validation, the best-performing fold was then selected and evaluated on the test set, achieving training accuracies of 99.05%, 99.91% and testing accuracies of 97.72%, 98.73%, respectively.

{"id":"science_plos_one_6800a37ee8ea","title":"Incidence and predictors of chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients in Ethiopia: A Bayesian multivariate joint model","content":"by Dejen Kahsay Asgedom, Habtamu Wagnew Abuhay, Lemma Derseh Background Hypertension (HTN) is a major contributor to chronic kidney disease (CKD), a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. In low-resource settings such as Ethiopia, where CKD risk factors remain understudied, identifying predictors and longitudinal blood pressure (BP) patterns associated with CKD incidence is crucial for early intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of CKD, as well as its association with longitudinal BP changes, among hypertensive patients in Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital. Using a Bayesian joint modeling approach, we integrated Cox proportional hazard and linear mixed effects models to evaluate the effects of time-dependent BP trajectories on CKD risk. The data were entered into the Kobo toolbox and analyzed with R software (version 4.3.1). Results A total of 408 hypertensive patients were followed for 2322.83 person-years. At the end of the follow-up, 58/408 (14.22%) developed CKD, with an incidence density of 2.5 cases per 100 person‐years (95% CI: 1.89–3.14). Both the current values and longitudinal the quarterly rate of change in BP were significantly associated with increased CKD risk. For systolic BP, the adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) was 6.25 (95% CrI: 2.85–9.85) for the current values and 3.75 (95% CrI: 3.16–7.95) for the quarterly rate of change. Similarly, the diastolic BP had an AHR of 4.32 (95% CrI: 2.35–8.27) for the current values and 5.64 (95% CrI: 4.24–10.82) for the quarterly rate of change. Additionally, age ≥ 65 years (AHR = 4.62; 95% CrI: 1.83–12.21), HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (AHR = 3.32; 95% CrI: 1.73–7.86), diabetes mellitus (AHR = 3.08; 95% CrI: 2.01–9.54), and proteinuria positivity (AHR = 2.85; 95% CrI: 1.48–5.55) were significant predictors of the incidence of CKD. These findings highlight the importance of close BP monitoring in Ethiopian hypertension clinics. Conclusion The incidence of CKD in this study was relatively high compared with that reported in previous similar studies conducted in Ethiopia. Our findings confirm that time-dependent systolic BP and diastolic BP trajectories are strongly associated with an increased risk of CKD. Additionally, age, low HDL-C levels (<40 mg/dl), the presence of diabetes mellitus, and proteinuria were identified as significant predictors of CKD. Therefore, effective CKD prevention among hypertensive patients in Ethiopia hinges on regularly checking both their current blood pressure levels and how those levels change over time. We also need to keep a close eye on older patients (65 + years), low HDL‐C, diabetes, and proteinuria to catch those at highest risk early and step in with care.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334428","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.931652","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":432,"author":"Lemma Derseh","raw_content_length":2885,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":2.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital","Lemma Derseh Background Hypertension (HTN"],"persons":["Habtamu Wagnew Abuhay","Dejen Kahsay Asgedom"],"locations":["Ethiopia","Bayesian"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2850,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["predictors","chronic kidney disease","Ethiopia","Incidence","hypertensive patients","A Bayesian multivariate","joint model","CKD","Dejen Kahsay Asgedom","Habtamu Wagnew Abuhay"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"predictors":4.0,"chronic kidney disease":3.0,"Ethiopia":3.0,"Incidence":2.0,"hypertensive patients":2.0,"A Bayesian multivariate":2.0,"joint model":2.0,"CKD":2.0,"Dejen Kahsay Asgedom":1.0,"Habtamu Wagnew Abuhay":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734615436388888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.4469999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5106,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.488,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0468,"sadness":0.1834,"fear":0.197,"anger":0.014,"disgust":0.0638},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies predictors of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients in Ethiopia.

Alsa’d, Maysoon Raed Alnajdawi The combination of ABT-199, a BCL-2 inhibitor, and Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, holds great potential in colorectal cancer therapy due to their synergistic effects. However, their poor solubility and bioavailability present challenges for effective treatment. This study aimed to co-encapsulate these drugs in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles to enhance stability, control drug release, and preserve their synergistic anti-proliferative effects in colorectal cancer cells. This study initially focused on evaluating the anti-proliferative activity of free ABT-199 and Vorinostat in HT-29 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. The drugs demonstrated potent cytotoxic effects, with Vorinostat exhibiting IC50 values of 1.32 µM in HT-29 cells and 2.04 µM in HCT116 cells, while ABT-199 displayed IC50 values of 4.04 µM and 5.49 µM, respectively. To investigate the interaction between ABT-199 and Vorinostat, the combination index was calculated using the Chou-Talalay method. The analysis revealed strong synergism between the drugs in both cell lines, with CI values consistently below 1 across all tested molar ratios. The most pronounced synergy was observed at a 1:1 molar ratio, which exhibited the lowest CI values. Building on these results, ABT-199-loaded nanoparticles (ABT-NPs), Vorinostat-loaded nanoparticles (VOR-NPs), and dual-loaded nanoparticles (DLNPs) were formulated using the nanoprecipitation method. ABT-NPs and VOR-NPs had sizes of 210.6 ± 6.2 nm and 202.5 ± 5.6 nm, with encapsulation efficiencies of 73.2 ± 4.81% and 86.4 ± 5.5%, respectively. The DLNPs, which co-encapsulated both drugs at a 1:2 molar ratio, exhibited a size of 210 ± 7.3 nm and maintained good stability. Cytotoxicity studies revealed that both ABT-NPs and VOR-NPs retained comparable anti-proliferative effects to the free drugs, with IC50 values close to those of their unencapsulated counterparts. Furthermore, DLNPs enhanced the anti-proliferative effect, significantly increased the apoptotic cells as measured by flow cytometry which was coincided with an increasing caspase-3 activity in both HT-29 and HCT116 cells, indicating an enhanced apoptotic response.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334427","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.932216","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":323,"author":"Maysoon Raed Alnajdawi","raw_content_length":2326,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.615,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Vorinostat","HT-29","HCT116","Maysoon Raed Alnajdawi","ABT"],"persons":["Zainab Zaki Zakaraya","Alhareth A.

Methods A cross-section study was conducted from June 1,2024 to May 31, 2025, including 10,409 residents aged 18–64 in Beijing. Logistic regression was applied to examine demographic, behavioral, and knowledge-related factors associated SSB consumption. Results The overall prevalence of SSB consumption was 38.7%. After adjusting for demographic factors, infrequent checking nutrition labels when purchasing food (ORs ranging from 1.348 to 1.570), infrequent active weight monitoring (ORs ranging from 1.290 to 1.428), dining out/taking out food >1 day/week (ORs ranging from3.495 to6.692), moderate-intensity physical activity less than 300 minutes a week (ORs ranging from 1.237 to 1.326), lack of knowledge about SSB (ORs ranging from 1.240 to 1.361), and awareness of the health risks of SSB (OR=1.198) were the risk factors for SSB consumption.

{"id":"science_plos_one_dcc7b0ae87e0","title":"Improving Parkinson’s disease management through wearable technology: A cost","content":"by Daniel Rodriguez-Martin, Andreu Català, Joan Cabestany Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, with significant economic and social implications. The increasing prevalence of PD, coupled with rising healthcare costs, necessitates cost-effective solutions for patient management. Wearable medical devices, such as STAT-ON™, an inertial sensor with AI processing capability, offer an opportunity to enhance symptom monitoring, optimize therapy adjustments, and improve patient quality of life (QoL). However, their cost-effectiveness in routine clinical practice remains insufficiently explored. This study conducts a cost-benefit analysis of integrating STAT-ON™ into European healthcare systems (Spain, Sweden, Germany, Italy, and the UK). Using validated clinical data, we assess the economic impact of early symptom detection facilitated by continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that improved symptom assessment can lead to optimized medication regimens, reducing hospitalizations and institutional care costs. While medication costs may increase, overall direct healthcare expenses decrease, leading to net savings. As an example, the study estimates potential cost reductions of up to €137.8 million in Germany and €19 million in Sweden when STAT-ON™ is used to detect advanced PD symptoms. Despite these promising results, limitations exist, including variations in healthcare costs, reimbursement policies, and real-world adoption rates across the different countries. Additionally, indirect costs such as caregiver burden were not fully analyzed. Future longitudinal studies are needed to further validate the economic and clinical benefits of wearable monitoring devices in PD management. This study highlights the potential of STAT-ON™ as a valuable tool for reducing healthcare costs and enhancing patient outcomes, supporting its adoption as a complementary solution for objective PD assessment in clinical practice.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334413","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.933187","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":267,"author":"Joan Cabestany","raw_content_length":2015,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.335,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["STAT-ON"],"persons":["Daniel Rodriguez-Martin"],"locations":["Italy","Germany","Sweden","Spain"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2007,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Parkinsons disease management","wearable technology","Daniel Rodriguez-Martin","Andreu Català","Joan Cabestany Parkinsons Disease","a progressive neurodegenerative disorder","millions","patients","significant economic and social implications","The increasing prevalence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Parkinsons disease management":2.0,"wearable technology":2.0,"Daniel Rodriguez-Martin":1.0,"Andreu Català":1.0,"Joan Cabestany Parkinsons Disease":1.0,"a progressive neurodegenerative disorder":1.0,"millions":1.0,"patients":1.0,"significant economic and social implications":1.0,"The increasing prevalence":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734663531111112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6197,"joy":0.0169,"surprise":0.0357,"sadness":0.1882,"fear":0.0428,"anger":0.0407,"disgust":0.0559},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a cost-benefit analysis of a wearable device (STAT-ON™) for Parkinson's disease management, showing potential cost reductions in healthcare expenses due to optimized medication regimens and reduced hospitalizations.

{"id":"science_plos_one_52ace98324be","title":"On the effectiveness of network metrics on key class prediction: An empirical study","content":"by Shiyuan Zhou, Wei Wu, Jiale Wang, Hongbing Liu, Chenxiang Yuan Key classes are the most important classes in a software system, which provide an excellent foundation for developers—especially those new to the field—to understand unfamiliar software systems. In the past decade, several key class prediction (KCP) approaches have been proposed. They used design metrics extracted from source code and unweighted network metrics computed on class coupling networks as features and built machine-learning models to predict whether a class is a key class or not. However, previous studies mainly focused on improving the performance of KCP models in the within-project (i.e., KCP in the same project) context, and the network metrics they used are unweighted and inaccurate, as they are computed on unweighted and incomplete class coupling networks. These limitations lead to a lack of thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of network metrics for KCP, especially in the cross-project (KCP across diverse projects) context, which in turn results in uncertainty about how to choose suitable metrics as features when building KCP models. To fill this gap, in this paper, we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of network metrics for KCP. Specifically, we build weighted and more complete class coupling networks for software, and introduce a set of weighted network metrics to characterize class complexity. Then, we build different KCP models using the Random Forest learner and the Naive Bayes model for two KCP contexts (i.e., within-project and cross-project), respectively, with design metrics, unweighted/weighted network metrics, and their combinations being features. Finally, through an empirical study on 18 open-source Java projects, we thoroughly investigate the relative effectiveness of network metrics over design metrics across the two KCP contexts. Our results suggest that when building KCP models, to achieve better performance, researchers and practitioners should consider using unweighted (or weighted) network metrics alone or along with design metrics in the within-project KCP context, using design metrics alone or along with unweighted (or weighted) network metrics in the cross-project KCP context, and using unweighted (or weighted) network metrics along with design metrics across the two KCP contexts.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334408","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.934456","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":343,"author":"Chenxiang Yuan","raw_content_length":2530,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.715,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Hongbing Liu","Chenxiang Yuan","Wei Wu","Jiale Wang"],"locations":["Shiyuan Zhou"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2333,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the effectiveness","network metrics","key class prediction","Shiyuan Zhou","Wei Wu","Jiale Wang","Hongbing Liu","Key classes","the most important classes","a software system"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the effectiveness":2.0,"network metrics":2.0,"key class prediction":2.0,"Shiyuan Zhou":1.0,"Wei Wu":1.0,"Jiale Wang":1.0,"Hongbing Liu":1.0,"Key classes":1.0,"the most important classes":1.0,"a software system":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734679658611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.4985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6997,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8314,"joy":0.0445,"surprise":0.064,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.027,"anger":0.0156,"disgust":0.0143},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article focuses on improving software understanding, which has an indirect link to sustainability.

King, Enoch Ng’oma Developmental conditions, including temperature, diet, and parasite exposure, can shape adult fitness phenotypes across species. While studies often examine the independent effects of early-life and adult conditions on life history traits, fewer have focused on their interactive effects, particularly in genetically diverse populations. Here, we investigate how larval and adult diet interact to influence lifespan and fecundity in a genetically diverse population of Drosophila melanogaster. We manipulated protein availability across larval and adult stages and found significant larval-adult diet interactions affecting both traits, though in different ways. Several key patterns emerged, including age- and sex-specific effects, survival differences in the post-median life phase, shifts in the timing of peak fecundity, and sustained egg production in older stages. Protein reduction increased male maximum lifespan and female lifetime fecundity, while lower adult protein intake delayed egg-laying by approximately two weeks, particularly in flies that also experienced low developmental protein. These findings underscore the importance of assessing life history traits dynamically over time, as interactions between developmental and adult environments may drive complex, non-additive effects that are not apparent in cross-sectional measurements. Considering both additive and interactive effects in diverse genetic backgrounds will be critical for understanding the evolutionary and ecological consequences of nutritional variation.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334341","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.934879","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Enoch Ng’oma","raw_content_length":1624,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Drosophila"],"persons":["De’anne Donnell","Elizabeth G.

The catalyst was prepared via an eco-friendly hydrothermal method using Laurus nobilis leaf extract as a bio-reducing agent, emphasizing sustainability. Structural characterization revealed significant enhancement in surface properties, with the modified catalyst exhibiting a high surface area (214.7 ± 3.5 m2/g) and optimized pore architecture (0.36 cm3/g volume, 6.7 nm average diameter) featuring 80% mesopores and 20% micropores. Under mild conditions (pH 7, 25°C, 0.5 g/L catalyst dose, 10 mM peroxymonosulfate), the system achieved 92.3% COD and 93.5% BOD5 removal within 3 hours for wastewater laden with the beta-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin (50 mg/L). LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the complete degradation of the target pollutants, with no toxic intermediate byproducts detected. The catalyst exhibited exceptional stability, retaining >86% efficiency after five reuse cycles, with minimal metal leaching (Fe/Mn < 0.3 mg/L, within WHO limits).

This study aimed to assess the magnitude and factors associated with timely ANC initiation among pregnant women attending their first ANC visit during their most recent pregnancy in Ethiopia. Methods We analysed weighted data from 2,037 pregnant women who attended their first ANC visit during their most recent pregnancy, extracted from the 2021/2022 Ethiopian Service Provision Assessment. We fitted a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model to examine individual and facility level factors influencing timely ANC initiation, which was calculated in weeks. We reported descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages, and regression results using adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted all analyses using STATA version 16 software. Results The magnitude of timely ANC initiation in Ethiopia was 14.9%, with a mean gestational age at initiation of 22 weeks. Primary education (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.08, 2.82), partner involvement (AOR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.96), and attending non-public facilities (AOR = 2.49, 95% CI: 1.45, 4.28) were associated with higher odds of timely ANC initiation. Conversely, bypassing nearby facilities (AOR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.64) and attending facilities in large central regions (AOR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.40) or small peripheral regions (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.52) were associated with lower odds of timely ANC initiation. Conclusion One in seven pregnant women in Ethiopia initiated ANC within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, far below the World Health Organization recommendation that all pregnant women should begin ANC within this period.

This research aimed to identify significant and unexpected adverse events (AEs) associated with obinutuzumab by utilizing data from the US Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) databases, with the intention of providing a reference for the safe and rational clinical use of the drug. Research design and methods The reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), and empirical Bayesian geometric average (EBGM) were employed to analyze the AEs of obinutuzumab using the registration data from the FAERS and JADER databases spanning from 2013 to 2025. Results The study screened 7,868 and 1,584 AE reports related to obinutuzumab from the FAERS and JADER databases, respectively. These AEs involved 198 and 39 risk signals, respectively, and were associated with 16 and 8 system organ classes. In the analysis of the top 30 preferred terms, 19 and 15 risk signals in the FAERS and JADER databases, respectively, were not documented in the drug instruction. Moreover, when obinutuzumab is used for tumor indications, the frequency and signal strength of AEs related to infection and infusion-related reaction (IRR) are higher than those when it is used for non-tumor indications. Conclusion The results of signal mining indicate that more attention should be paid to the risks of obinutuzumab-related AEs. Strengthening clinical medication monitoring is necessary to mitigate the impact of AEs on patients’ prognosis and quality of life.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334317","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.937679","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Zhanqi Cao","raw_content_length":1834,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.345,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report","ROR","JADER","EBGM","PRR","BCPNN","the US Food and Drug Administration’s Adverse Event Reporting System"],"persons":["Haonan Liang","FAERS","Ping Leng","Cao Background Obinutuzumab","Xiangpeng Li"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1799,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["obinutuzumab","Safety assessment","Xiangpeng Li","Haonan Liang","Ping Leng","Zhanqi Cao Background Obinutuzumab","the treatment","lymphocytic leukemia","follicular lymphoma","This research"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"obinutuzumab":3.0,"Safety assessment":2.0,"Xiangpeng Li":1.0,"Haonan Liang":1.0,"Ping Leng":1.0,"Zhanqi Cao Background Obinutuzumab":1.0,"the treatment":1.0,"lymphocytic leukemia":1.0,"follicular lymphoma":1.0,"This research":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734752558888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.582,"joy":0.0337,"surprise":0.0249,"sadness":0.0144,"fear":0.3237,"anger":0.0136,"disgust":0.0076},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article analyzes adverse events related to a drug, obinutuzumab, using data from FAERS and JADER databases.

Mugavero, Latesha Elopre Young, Black Gay, and Bisexual men who have sex with men (YBGBM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV, especially in Southern United States. We conducted a cross-sectional survey (Feb19-Mar20). Eligibility criteria were self-reported age 16–29 years, HIV-negative, Black race, and cis-gender male. We assessed associations between demographics, religiosity, intersectional stigma, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use (never, previous or current) among YBGBM in Alabama. Univariate and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were fit with factors selected a priori, guided by a conceptual framework including individual-, interpersonal- and structural-level barriers to PrEP. 305 participants completed surveys (median age 24, 75% employed, 32% lacked personal transportation, and 41% reported annual incomes < $15,000). Compared to never PrEP use (n = 219), factors associated with current PrEP use (n = 51) included: ≥ college degree [AOR (95% CI): 5.48 (2.05, 14.62)], friends’ social support [AOR (95% CI): 1.33 (1.00, 1.52)], perceived HIV risk [AOR (95% CI): 1.27 (1.14, 1.42)], and PrEP knowledge [AOR (95% CI): 1.42 (1.23, 1.65)] AND factors associated with previous PrEP use (n = 35) included: depression [AOR (95% CI): 3.08 (1.34, 7.09)], condom use less than all the time [AOR (95% CI): 11.98 (1.52, 94.41)], intrinsic religiosity [AOR (95% CI): 0.77 (0.68, 0.88)], stable housing [AOR (95% CI): 0.30 (0.11, 0.81)], perceived sexual stigma [AOR (95% CI): 0.84 (0.75, 0.94)], and perceived HIV risk [AOR (95% CI): 1.18 (1.05, 1.33)].

Bains, Rashi Chamadia, Dennis Robert, Preetham Putha, Adnan I. Qureshi Background Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) eligibility for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients depends upon clinical and advanced imaging assessments like CT perfusion (CTP). Assessment complexities and limited access to advanced imaging investigations are known challenges. We developed machine-learning models using routinely collected clinical and imaging data to predict MT eligibility. Methods Age, National-Institutes-of-Health-Stroke-Scale-Score (NIHSS), last-known-well-time (LKWT), noncontrast-CT (NCCT) scan and CT-angiography (CTA) report from consecutive cohort of 260 AIS-suspected patients treated at a stroke centre during Apr’20 to Dec’23 were retrospectively collected. 160 underwent MT for anterior-circulation large vessel occlusion (LVOa); rest were MT ineligible. MT eligibility was determined based on clinical and imaging investigations including CTP during routine-care. The dataset was split into train:test sets (50:50 split). A commercially available artificial-intelligence algorithm calculated infarct volume and ASPECT score (ASPECTSq) from the NCCTs. We developed two supervised models using Gradient-Boosting-Machines. MODEL1 utilized age, NIHSS, LKWT, ASPECTSq and infarct volume as inputs; MODEL2 additionally included the presence/absence of LVOa as input. The target/response variable used for our supervised learning methods was whether the patients were MT eligible or not as determined during routine-care. Performance of the models were investigated using the test set. Results Among 130 patients (mean age ± standard-deviation: 67.4 ± 14.2 years; 61 males) in test set, 80 (61.5%) were MT eligible; rest were ineligible. The area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristics-curve, sensitivity and specificity of MODEL1 were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67–0.85), 85% (75.6–91.2) and 60% (46.2–72.4), respectively. They were 0.92 (0.88–0.96), 82.5% (72.7–89.3) and 82% (69.2–90.2), respectively, for MODEL2. Conclusions The models showed promising results, demonstrating that NCCT, potentially with CTA, could be sufficient for MT eligibility determination. Such models can enable faster referrals of patients to higher centers.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334242","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.940099","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":297,"author":"Adnan I.

{"id":"science_plos_one_54cba4b144f9","title":"Single","content":"by Yun Zhang, Zhenyu Tang, Fenghui Xu, Kaichen Zhou, Kun Yang This paper proposes that the control process of the single-phase full bridge inverter circuit is equivalent to two buck circuits, and the control strategy of the DC-DC circuit is adopted to enable the output voltage to track the given sine wave target value in real time, realizing the control of the inverter circuit, simplifying the control process, and enhancing the anti-interference ability of the system. On the basis of traditional discrete sliding mode control, a new adaptive approach rate is introduced, which can dynamically adjust the control gain according to the distance between the sliding surface and the sliding band. When the state variable is far from the sliding surface, it accelerates the approach speed, and when the state variable approaches the sliding surface, it reduces the approach speed, which can effectively reduce chattering. As a result, the width level of the sliding mode band is reduced from the traditional O(T) to the same level O (T3), and the width of the sliding mode band is significantly reduced, significantly improving the control accuracy and jitter suppression ability. The proposed control method was rigorously mathematically proven in terms of sliding mode bandwidth, jitter range, and convergence steps, and the advantages of the improved method in voltage tracking speed, steady-state error, and disturbance rejection performance were verified through multiple simulation experiments.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334233","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.940632","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Kun Yang","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Zhenyu Tang","Kaichen Zhou","Fenghui Xu","Yun Zhang","Kun Yang"],"locations":["the DC-DC"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1500,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the control process","Yun Zhang","Zhenyu Tang","Fenghui Xu","Kaichen Zhou","Kun Yang","This paper","the single-phase full bridge inverter circuit","two buck circuits","the control strategy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Kaichen Zhou"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the control process":2.0,"Yun Zhang":1.0,"Zhenyu Tang":1.0,"Fenghui Xu":1.0,"Kaichen Zhou":1.0,"Kun Yang":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the single-phase full bridge inverter circuit":1.0,"two buck circuits":1.0,"the control strategy":1.0}},"age_hours":4.734821299166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8913,"joy":0.039,"surprise":0.0364,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0141,"disgust":0.008},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel control method for single-phase full bridge inverter circuits, aiming to improve control accuracy and jitter suppression.

Methods Total CO₂ was measured in patient samples using enzymatic assays. Stability was assessed over time, and CO₂ loss was examined in different blood collection tubes. Method comparison was conducted between the Snibe and the Roche CO₂ assays in various diseases. Results The Snibe CO₂ assay showed excellent linearity (r = 0.9997) and maintained stability for 42 days without recalibration, with control material deviations within ±5% of the target. CO₂ loss was observed in uncapped non-anticoagulant tubes (24.0% decline over 48 hours), but was less in EP tubes (9.4% decline). Significant differences of median CO₂ measurements were observed in only the renal group (Snibe: 13.35 mmol/L, Roche: 12.80 mmol/L) and the cardiovascular disease group (Snibe: 25.90 mmol/L, Roche: 26.40 mmol/L) versus the healthy group (Snibe: 22.70 mmol/L, Roche: 22.90 mmol/L) for both the Snibe and Roche assays. Conclusions The Snibe CO₂ assay demonstrated superior stability and comparable accuracy compared with the Roche reagent.

Bardaweel, Baraa Abu Sneineh, Rima Hajjo, Reema Abu Khalaf Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite advances in treatment, drug resistance remains a critical challenge. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a multifunctional cell surface protein, shows variable expression across malignancies and plays a role in cancer biology. DPP4 inhibitors, initially developed as antidiabetic agents, have demonstrated anticancer properties in several cancer types. In this study, network pharmacology analysis revealed that DPP4 inhibitors modulate critical cancer-associated pathways, such as proteoglycans in cancer, ECM(extracellular matrix)-receptor interaction, and PI3K-AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–protein kinase B) signaling. Experimental data showed dose-dependent growth inhibition in four CRC cell lines treated with FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved and novel DPP4 inhibitors. Combination treatments with doxorubicin yielded synergistic effects, whereas those with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) were either synergistic or additive. The examined DPP4 inhibitors effectively suppressed colony formation in HCT-116 cells and induced apoptosis. Additionally, the inhibitors resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and significantly reduced the expression of CD26 (Cluster of Differentiation 26), Bcl-2(B-cell lymphoma 2), and VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) in HCT-116 cells. Our findings highlight the potential therapeutic utility of DPP4 inhibitors in CRC treatment, either as standalone agents or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics. Moreover, the computational insights provided herein enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DPP4 inhibitors, paving the way for their potential clinical application.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334223","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.941681","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Reema Abu Khalaf","raw_content_length":1908,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DPP4","PI3K-AKT","CRC"],"persons":["Reema Abu Khalaf Colorectal","DPP4","Rima Hajjo","Sanaa K.

The clinical outcomes of these two groups differ significantly, yet the underlying reasons remain unclear, with limited studies addressing this issue. This study investigates the alterations in the pulmonary microbiota of HIV-positive and non-HIV patients following pneumocystis jirovecii infection.Collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with HIV and non HIV infected Pneumocystis jirovecii, and compare the differences in pulmonary microbiota between the two groups.In total, 77 patients with pulmonary infection that had next generation sequencing performed on their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and confirmed pneumocystis jirovecii infection were recruited in our study. Of the 77 patients with pneumocystis jirovecii infection, 52 were infected with HIV, and 25 were uninfected.Our findings indicate that HIV-positive patients exhibit a more diverse microbiota, predominantly characterized by viral co-infections. Specifically, 88.5% of HIV-positive patients experienced viral co-infections, primarily involving herpes viruses, followed by bacterial (61.5%) and fungal (40.4%) co-infections. In contrast, non-HIV patients predominantly exhibited bacterial co-infections (72%), followed by viral (52%) and fungal (36%) co-infections. By analyzing the next generation sequencing data of both groups, we identified statistically significant differences in viral infections (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were observed for bacterial or fungal infections. Furthermore, among the background bacteria detected via next generation sequencing in both patient groups, 22 microbial species were commonly present. Notably, Leptospiral virus, Rosette fungus, and Actinomycetes were detected at higher frequencies in HIV-infected pneumocystis jirovecii patients, with statistically significant differences.Through comparing the pulmonary microbiota profiles of HIV-positive and non-HIV patients post-pneumocystis jirovecii infection, we uncovered distinct differences between the two groups, which may hold implications for guiding subsequent treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334220","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.942418","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":301,"author":"Qing-Guo Wu","raw_content_length":2433,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.505,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Chang-Run Zhang","Li Liu","Mei Wang","Lei Wang","Yi-Dan Shen","Shuai Ren","Hai-Cheng Tang","Wei-Zhong Jin","Rui-Fang Chen"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2355,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Differential composition","the pulmonary microbiome","HIV","Chang-Run Zhang","Mei Wang","Lei Wang","Li Liu","Yi-Dan Shen","Rui-Fang Chen","Shuai Ren"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Shuai Ren"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Differential composition":2.0,"the pulmonary microbiome":2.0,"HIV":2.0,"Chang-Run Zhang":1.0,"Mei Wang":1.0,"Lei Wang":1.0,"Li Liu":1.0,"Yi-Dan Shen":1.0,"Rui-Fang Chen":1.0,"Shuai Ren":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7348704066666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.1105,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8242,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.0473,"sadness":0.0416,"fear":0.03,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0395},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies differences in pulmonary microbiota between HIV-positive and non-HIV patients post-pneumocystis jirovecii infection, potentially guiding treatment strategies.

We aimed to understand the effects of hospitalization for COVID-19 on mobility, cognition, and daily activities over 24-months of follow up. Materials and methods This was a 24-month extension of the COREG-FR prospective cohort study (NCT04602260). We enrolled consecutive adult patients (≥18 years) with lab confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection who were admitted to five Ontario, Canada hospitals between August 21, 2020, and December 21, 2021. Patients were excluded if they resided in an institution (e.g., long term care facility), had severe premorbid physical function limitations (e.g., unable to stand independently) or had cognitive impairment which limited their ability to complete follow-up assessment. We assessed mobility and cognitive status using the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) Basic Mobility Domain and Cognitive Domain, respectively. Deficits from premorbid status were determined using the minimal clinically important differences in mobility (≥ 3.3) and cognition (≥ 5.5). We also asked participants how much their COVID-19 recovery affected their daily activities within the preceding week with response options from ‘not at all’ to ‘all the time’. Results Among the 215 participants who participated 12-months after hospital discharge, 170 (79%) consented to the 24-month follow-up. The mean (standard deviation) age was 61.2 (12.7) years and 54% (n = 91) of participants who were male. Compared to pre-morbid function, mobility and cognitive deficits were present in 57% and 41% of participants, respectively. Furthermore, 59% of participants reported COVID-19 continued to impact their daily activities. Conclusion At 24-months after hospitalization for COVID-19, many participants experience persistent mobility and cognitive deficits. Future work should aim to develop comprehensive rehabilitation strategies for those recovering from COVID-19 which target mobility and cognitive function.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334212","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.942958","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":312,"author":"Jinhui Ma","raw_content_length":2258,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.56,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COREG-FR"],"persons":["MyLinh Duong","COVID","Jinhui Ma Introduction COVID-19","Marla Beauchamp","Aaron Jones","Terence Ho","Christopher Farley"],"locations":["Canada","Renata Kirkwood","Ontario"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2223,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hospitalization","Functional recovery","COVID","Marla Beauchamp","Christopher Farley","Renata Kirkwood","Aaron Jones","Terence Ho","MyLinh Duong","Parminder Raina"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Parminder Raina"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hospitalization":3.0,"Functional recovery":2.0,"COVID":2.0,"Marla Beauchamp":1.0,"Christopher Farley":1.0,"Renata Kirkwood":1.0,"Aaron Jones":1.0,"Terence Ho":1.0,"MyLinh Duong":1.0,"Parminder Raina":1.0}},"age_hours":4.73488695,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.671,"joy":0.0241,"surprise":0.035,"sadness":0.1589,"fear":0.0829,"anger":0.0063,"disgust":0.0217},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents data on the long-term effects of COVID-19 hospitalization on patient recovery.

Individuals with G6PDd are at risk of severe complications, including acute haemolytic anaemia, when exposed to oxidative triggers. In Malaysia, the Proto-Malay Orang Asli (PMOA), the second largest indigenous group in Peninsular Malaysia, represents a vulnerable population. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and mutation spectrum of G6PDd in this community. A total of 258 peripheral blood samples (91 males, 167 females) were screened using a quantitative G6PD assay (OSMMR2000-D). DNA from 73 samples was genotyped with the Hybribio G6PD GenoArray test, and 39 underwent targeted sequencing. The adjusted male median (AMM) of G6PD activity was 9.6 U/gHb (95% CI: 8.9–10.3 U/gHb), with 30% and 80% thresholds corresponding to 2.9 and 7.7 U/gHb, respectively. At the 30% cut-off threshold, the overall estimated prevalence of G6PDd was 6.8% (16/237; 12 males and 4 females). A total of 21 subjects were G6PD-intermediate (7 males and 14 females), and the remaining 221 subjects were G6PD-normal (72 males and 150 females). Genotyping identified 18 hemizygous males, 13 heterozygous females, and 3 homozygous females. Five G6PD variants were detected: G6PD Viangchan (39.5%), G6PD Coimbra (28.9%), G6PD Union (23.7%), G6PD Kaiping (5.3%), and rs782038151 (2.6%). This study demonstrates that G6PDd is common in the PMOA population, with notable molecular diversity. These findings have important implications for malaria control and the safe use of antimalarial drugs in this high-risk community.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334185","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.943388","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":278,"author":"Ainoon Othman","raw_content_length":1942,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.39,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Proto-Malay Orang Asli"],"persons":["Hafiza Alauddin","Aishah Sulaiman","Muhammad Ziqrill Mohd","Najiah Ajlaa Ayub","Othman Glucose-6-phosphate","Muhammad-Redha Abdullah-Zawawi","Muhammad Dinie Afif Jamaludin","Mohamed Afiq Hidayat Zailani","Azma Raja Sabudin","Azlin Ithnin","Raja Zahratul"],"locations":["Malaysia","Peninsular","G6PDd"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1934,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["G6PD deficiency","Malaysias Proto","G6PDd","Mohamed Afiq Hidayat Zailani","Raja Zahratul Azma Raja Sabudin","Muhammad-Redha Abdullah-Zawawi","Azlin Ithnin","Hafiza Alauddin","Siti Aishah Sulaiman","Najiah Ajlaa Ayub"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Mohamed Afiq Hidayat Zailani"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"G6PD deficiency":2.0,"Malaysias Proto":2.0,"G6PDd":2.0,"Mohamed Afiq Hidayat Zailani":1.0,"Raja Zahratul Azma Raja Sabudin":1.0,"Muhammad-Redha Abdullah-Zawawi":1.0,"Azlin Ithnin":1.0,"Hafiza Alauddin":1.0,"Siti Aishah Sulaiman":1.0,"Najiah Ajlaa Ayub":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7349034011111115,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1454,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.02,"sadness":0.2237,"fear":0.5751,"anger":0.0155,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies the prevalence and genetic diversity of G6PD deficiency in the Proto-Malay Orang Asli population.

{"id":"science_plos_one_47ec484dc9e9","title":"Exploring Nurse Dyads’ experiences of scope of practice in nursing homes: A qualitative descriptive study from the FLORENCE project","content":"by Ole Martin Nordaunet, Hanne Aagaard, Cecilia Olsson, Edith Roth Gjevjon, Gunilla Borglin Background A nurse’s scope of practice includes the full range of roles, functions, responsibilities, and decision-making authority. However, how this scope—particularly in relation to the fundamentals of care—is experienced by registered nurses and non-registered nurses in nursing homes remains underexplored. This study aimed to explore the experiences of nurses regarding their mutual general scope of practice, the differences in their individual scope of practice, and their respective scopes in relation to the fundamentals of care in the context of nursing homes. Methods This qualitative study included eight nursing dyads (n = 16) from four nursing homes in south-east Norway. Data were collected through individual, focused interviews, i.e., non-dyadic data, and analysed using the framework method for dyadic analysis. The study followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR). Results Registered nurses described emotional strain due to a gap between professional ideals and the realities of high-pressure, understaffed environments. The contrast between being perceived as “too posh to wash” and “too busy” highlighted how systemic factors, rather than personal attitudes, shaped role perceptions. These constraints influenced care delivery and undermined their professional identity. Registered nurses tended to focus on indirect care and physical needs, while non-registered nurses took on more direct care, particularly the fundamentals of care—physical, relational, and psychosocial. Although the registered nurses valued holistic care, frequent delegation to the non-registered nurses raised concerns about care quality and role clarity. Conclusion Registered nurses’ scope of practice was shaped more by workload demands than by reluctance to engage in the fundamentals of care. The dyadic approach provided new insights into how professional responsibilities and activities are co-constructed in complex care settings. Findings highlight the need for organisational and clinical strategies to clarify role boundaries, strengthen registered nurses’ professional identity, reinforce the delivery of the fundamentals of care, and support effective and safe delegation practices.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334124","published_date":"2025-10-10T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:57.944319","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","multidisciplinary","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":316,"author":"Gunilla Borglin","raw_content_length":2340,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.58,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hanne Aagaard","FLORENCE"],"persons":["Gunilla Borglin Background","Ole Martin Nordaunet","Cecilia Olsson"],"locations":["Norway"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2305,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["practice","nursing homes","Nurse Dyads experiences","scope","the FLORENCE project","Ole Martin Nordaunet","Hanne Aagaard","Cecilia Olsson","Edith Roth Gjevjon","Gunilla Borglin Background A nurses scope"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"practice":3.0,"nursing homes":3.0,"Nurse Dyads experiences":2.0,"scope":2.0,"the FLORENCE project":2.0,"Ole Martin Nordaunet":1.0,"Hanne Aagaard":1.0,"Cecilia Olsson":1.0,"Edith Roth Gjevjon":1.0,"Gunilla Borglin Background A nurses scope":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7349353574999995,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8337,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.1064,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0155,"anger":0.0108,"disgust":0.0204},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study explores the experiences of nurses in nursing homes, highlighting systemic issues affecting their scope of practice.

Understanding the molecular basis of this phenotypic diversity remains a key challenge. Building on prior evidence of gene regulatory network (GRN) rewiring underpinning adaptive traits, we profiled chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and matched transcriptomes across brain, eye, liver, and testis tissues in five representative cichlid species using optimised protocols. We show extensive divergence in chromatin accessibility corresponding to phylogenetic lineages and tissue identity, with many regulatory regions exhibiting accelerated nucleotide evolution. Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) variation correlates with both chromatin accessibility and differential gene expression, particularly in genes linked to sensory systems. By integrating TF footprinting with regulatory motif turnover analyses, we demonstrate that dynamic nucleotide changes drive GRN rewiring, concordant with ecological niche and lineage-specific adaptations. Our findings highlight regulatory variation at conserved and novel TFBSs as critical drivers of phenotypic innovation across radiating and non-radiating East African cichlids. This study provides foundational epigenomic evidence establishing GRN divergence as a key mechanism facilitating rapid adaptive diversification in this iconic vertebrate radiation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681187v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.316709","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Mehta, T.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_9208b955895d","title":"Methylglyoxal alters C-fibre Activity","content":"Introduction: Raised plasma levels of the glycolytic metabolite methylglyoxal are associated with pain symptoms in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Methylglyoxal can regulate the function of NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 ion channels that are involved in the phenomenon of activity-dependent slowing (ADS) in C-fibre nociceptors. C-fibre ADS differs between the sexes and can regulate spinal network function. Objective: Explore the impact of methylglyoxal upon C-fibre ADS and pain sensitivity in both sexes. In addition, investigate the influence of ADS upon the processing of C-fibre inputs, in noxious heat responsive spinal neurons. Results: Compound action potential recording of isolated dorsal roots incubated with methylglyoxal (100M, 3 hr) revealed a sex-dependent impact upon C-fibre ADS. In male roots, C-fibre ADS was reduced whereas in female roots it was increased. Acute methylglyoxal application (100M/1mM, 10 min) did not modify C-fibre ADS. Systemic methylglyoxal administration (5g, 3h prior) induced heat hyperalgesia in male but not female juvenile rats. Patch-clamp recording in spinal slices with attached dorsal roots revealed that length-dependent manipulation of ADS altered action potential firing to stimulus trains in noxious heat responsive Fos-EGFP+ spinal neurons. Conclusion: We propose that methylglyoxal sex-dependent regulation of C-fibre ADS influences the spinal processing of noxious heat inputs that may contribute to the male specific induction of heat hyperalgesia following systemic methylglyoxal treatment.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.680671v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.317091","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Velichkova, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_4b06f3058dad","title":"Integrating Mutation and Stop Signals for Improved RNA Structure Analysis and Insight Discovery","content":"Background: Understanding RNA structures is essential for exploring its diverse cellular roles. Chemical modification-based RNA structure probing remains a key approach to revealing RNA structures in complex in vivo conditions. Practically, chemical modifications generate both mutation and stop signals during reverse transcription within a single experiment. However, traditional analysis pipelines often rely on only one of the two signals without fully leveraging both. Results: To address this, we developed a machine learning-based approach, STONE, that integrates both signals from a single experiment. STONE improved RNA structure analysis across multiple independent validation regions, notably 28S rRNA, viral RNA and regulatory RNAs. In genome-wide datasets, especially single-cell data, STONE significantly increased nucleotide coverage per transcript and improved gene detection reliability. In genome-wide datasets, especially single-cell data, STONE substantially enhanced structural information coverage at both transcript and nucleotide levels. This maximized signal utilization, yielding RNA structures in single-cell data comparable to those from bulk datasets. Furthermore, STONE-derived structural scores allow direct identification of RNA-binding protein binding sites directly from a single probing experiment, with results on RNAs such as U1 snRNA, RNase P RNA, and XIST lncRNA closely matching established techniques like CLIP-seq and RNP-MaP. Conclusions: By integrating mutation and stop signals from one single experiment, STONE advances RNA structure analysis accuracy, extends nucleotide coverage, and facilitates complex RNA-protein interaction studies, broadening the method's applications in RNA-based research.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681285v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.317691","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Zhou, T., Zhao, R., Yin, S., Hong, Y., Wang, J., Liu, X., Chen, Q., Wang, Y., Liu, C., Sun, L.","raw_content_length":1744,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["STONE","RNA","Chemical"],"persons":["RNA"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1744,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Integrating","Mutation","Signals","Improved RNA Structure Analysis","Insight Discovery","RNA structures","its diverse cellular roles","Chemical modification-based RNA structure","a key approach","complex"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Insight Discovery"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Integrating":2.0,"Mutation":2.0,"Signals":2.0,"Improved RNA Structure Analysis":2.0,"Insight Discovery":2.0,"RNA structures":2.0,"its diverse cellular roles":1.0,"Chemical modification-based RNA structure":1.0,"a key approach":1.0,"complex":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73644062416667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8195,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.008,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0737,"anger":0.0306,"disgust":0.0574},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a machine learning approach (STONE) that improves RNA structure analysis by integrating mutation and stop signals.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_80b4cad99ecc","title":"Chronic kidney disease exacerbates hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis via miR","content":"Background: Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), hyperlipidemia is a common sequela of CKD, which is linked to increased lipid synthesis, impaired lipoprotein clearance, and maladapted reverse cholesterol transport. Because exosomes can transport miRNAs to modulate intercellular and tissue communication, we hypothesized that exosomal miRNAs can act as endocrine-like molecules to modulate the CKD-associated hyperlipidemia and ASCVD. Methods: Small RNA-seq and qPCR were used to determine the differential plasma level of exosomal miR-148a-3p in ASCVD patients with and without CKD. RNA-seq and in silico analysis were used to establish the regulation of lipid metabolism via miR-148a-3p/salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1)/AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 1 subunit (AMPK?1) in the liver. Inhibition of miR-148a-3p or overexpression of SIK1/AMPK1 in ApoE-/- mice with 5/6 nephrectomy was used to elucidate the role of the miR-148a-3p/SIK1/AMPK1 axis in CKD-related hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Results: The plasma level of exosomal miR-148a-3p was significantly elevated in patients with ASCVD and CKD (ASCVD/CKD) and ApoE-/- mice with 5/6 nephrectomy. Via circulating exosomes, kidney-generated miR-148a-3p was delivered to the liver, where it targeted SIK1/AMPK1 transcripts, thereby upregulating SREBP2/PCSK9 and reciprocally downregulating LDLR. Levels of SIK1 and AMPK1 were decreased in hepatocytes transfected with miR-148a-3p or treated with plasma exosomes from ASCVD/CKD patients, with attendant SREBP2 activation and attenuated LDL-C binding. The decreased LDL-C binding was rectified by SIK1/AMPK1 or LNA-miR-148a-3p overexpression. LNA-miR-148a-3p or AAV8-SIK1/AMPK administration in 5/6 nephrectomy/ApoE-/- mice significantly ameliorated hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Conclusion: In ASCVD/CKD patients and nephrectomy/ApoE-/- mice, kidney-originating miR-148a-3p targeted hepatic SIK1/AMPK1 mRNA. This exosome-mediated endocrine effect upregulated SREBP2/PCSK9 and reciprocally reduced LDLR level, which elevated plasma LDL-C level and exacerbated ASCVD. These findings underscore a kidney-liver-artery axis involved in cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome.

In this study, we found that only tigecycline and minocycline reduce the antibacterial activity in light, and this inferiority has severely hindered their scope of clinical use. By strategically regulating the photolysis pathway, we identified chalcanthite, which primarily contains Cu2+. By conducting antibiotic susceptibility test and electron microscopy analysis, Cu2+ salts (including copper sulfate, copper chloride, and copper gluconate) were confirmed to restore the antibacterial activity of tigecycline under light exposure against all tested bacterial strains. Spectroscopic characterization combined with quantum chemical calculations elucidated the molecular mechanism by which Cu2+ selectively modulates the photolytic degradation pathway of tigecycline and structural determinants (dimethylamino groups on the D ring). Multi-omics technologies revealed the mechanism underlying the Cu2+-mediated (non-antibacterial) inhibition of bacterial ferric citrate transporter. Animal infection models were developed using diverse drug-resistant pathogens to validate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of copper gluconate-tigecycline combination therapy under photic conditions. These findings revealed effective adjuvants that facilitate the development of topical tigecycline formulations, and the establishment of a scientific foundation for synthesizing photostable tetracycline-based antibiotics through structural optimization.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681327v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.318860","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Xue, J., Zhou, Q., Liu, Y., Ma, L., Liu, H., Lv, Q., Gu, K., Wang, J., Zhou, Y.","raw_content_length":1587,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tetracyclines"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1587,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The role","medicinal Cu2","salts","the multi","Tetracyclines","photolysis","pollution","water","land","other ecosystems"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The role":2.0,"medicinal Cu2":2.0,"salts":2.0,"the multi":2.0,"Tetracyclines":1.0,"photolysis":1.0,"pollution":1.0,"water":1.0,"land":1.0,"other ecosystems":1.0}},"age_hours":18.73650059,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.376,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7248,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5016,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.0053,"sadness":0.045,"fear":0.0238,"anger":0.0561,"disgust":0.3642},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents research on using Cu2+ salts to restore the antibacterial activity of tigecycline under light exposure, addressing the photolysis issue that causes pollution.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_388afcc561c4","title":"Translation regulation of ATF4 by the termination complex Hbs1","content":"Inherited retinal diseases are a class of genetically heterogenous disorders characterized by mutations in genes required for retinal function, resulting in progressive loss of vision in human patients. One such deletion mutation in the translation termination factor, HBS1L, results in a suite of developmental anomalies in human patients, including progressive vision loss defects. HBS1L and its interaction partner Pelota (Pelo), are required for recycling stalled ribosomes on mRNAs, but the specific mRNA target causative of vision defects seen with HBS1L deletion remains unknown. Further, the specific cell types in the visual system that require HBS1L for proper development and function are also unknown. Here, we discover that loss of the Drosophila HBS1L homolog, Hbs1, results in reduced expression of the stress responsive Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) which is encoded by an mRNA containing multiple upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5' leader. We corroborate these results in cultured human cells, where we find that HBS1L and Pelo promote translation reinitiation at the ATF4 ORF by facilitating proper translation termination at the preceding uORFs. Like human HBS1L deficiency patients, loss of function Drosophila mutants for Hbs1, pelo, and ATF4 show vision defects as measured by electroretinograms (ERG). Depleting Hbs1 in lamina neurons replicated the ERG defects seen in Hbs1 mutants, suggesting that Hbs1-Pelo is required for proper lamina neuron function. Further confocal analysis of Hbs1 mutants revealed vacuolization defects in the lamina layer, which are indicative of defective synapse formation between lamina neurons and photoreceptors. Strikingly, restoring ATF4 expression in the lamina partially rescued ERG defects in Hbs1 mutants, indicating that ATF4 is likely a relevant mRNA target regulated by Hbs1-Pelo in these cells. Together, our data support a model wherein Hbs1-Pelo mediated translation regulation of ATF4 in lamina neurons underlies the inherited retinal disease caused by HBS1L deletion.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681214v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.319208","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":300,"author":"Querry, K., Lago-Baldaia, I., Nampoothiri V.P., N., Garbark, C., Carney, A.

We demonstrate that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and pericytes isolated from peripheral blood represent superior alternatives for biobanking across three mammalian genera (Canis, Bison, and Equus). Blood-derived cells exhibited 2-3 fold faster doubling rates (15-20 hours versus >35 hours for fibroblasts) and reduced time to generate banked lines from 3-4 weeks to 1.5-2 weeks. Proteomic profiling of 32 canonical markers confirmed EPCs and pericytes represent distinct populations with lineage-specific molecular signatures. Optical genome mapping demonstrated equivalent genomic stability across all cell types with no detectable structural variants or aneuploidies. Critically, interspecific somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) experiments confirmed both EPCs and pericytes generate viable embryos with efficiency meeting or exceeding fibroblasts. Gray wolf blood-derived cells produced six viable fetuses with 15% implantation rate, while bison EPCs showed higher blastocyst formation (7%) than fibroblasts (3%) from the same individual. Blood collection during routine veterinary procedures offers minimally invasive sampling with reduced contamination compared to skin biopsies. These findings support integrating blood-derived cell banking into conservation programs, enabling opportunistic genetic preservation during standard management activities and expanding options for genetic rescue through assisted reproductive technologies.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.680978v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.319517","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Knecht, L., Mastracci, A., Miyawaki, T., Charles, F., Gedman, G.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_8a47cc9b3f46","title":"Acoustic Coupling for Double","content":"Objective: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with the potential for precise targeting of small and deep human brain circuitry. To ensure rigorous and reproducible effects, it is necessary to implement double-blinding to mitigate potential experimental biases. This study innovates on previous ultrasound coupling methods by embedding a 3D-printed thermoplastic disc in a high-density gel-polymer matrix to create identical gel-plastic coupling devices that either transmit (verum) or block (sham) ultrasound. Methods: We evaluated varying thicknesses (1.5 mm, 2,0 mm, 2.5 mm) and infill densities (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) for insertion loss and effects on beam characteristics across relevant human neuromodulation frequencies from 0.2 - 1 MHz. Results: ABS at 1.5mm thickness and 50% infill had the lowest insertion loss at 0.50MHz of 0.9 +/- 0.04dB demonstrating acoustic transparency suitable for a verum device. For the sham device, we introduced an internal air gap that produced 31 dB insertion loss at 0.50MHz. The verum device demonstrated minimal effects on the beam shape with a radial peak shift of 0.3 +/- 0.2mm and an average axial shift of 0.5 mm. Discussion: This novel gel-plastic coupling device can be tailored to most LIFU transducer shapes and is designed to support double-blind protocols by maintaining visual and tactile indistinguishability while controlling transmitted energy. This method provides a cost-effective and easily implementable solution for double-blinding in human LIFU studies to improve the reliability and rigor of experimental outcomes.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.02.680055v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.320096","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Kapoor, A., Strohman, A., Ni, Y., Isaac, G., Raymond, J., Legon, W.","raw_content_length":1671,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Acoustic Coupling for Double","Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene","sham"],"persons":[],"locations":["LIFU"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1671,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Acoustic Coupling","Objective","Low-intensity focused ultrasound","LIFU","a non-invasive neuromodulation technique","the potential","precise targeting","small and deep human brain circuitry","rigorous and reproducible effects","double-blinding"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["small and deep human brain circuitry"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Acoustic Coupling":2.0,"Objective":1.0,"Low-intensity focused ultrasound":1.0,"LIFU":1.0,"a non-invasive neuromodulation technique":1.0,"the potential":1.0,"precise targeting":1.0,"small and deep human brain circuitry":1.0,"rigorous and reproducible effects":1.0,"double-blinding":1.0}},"age_hours":18.736563202777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.01,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.802,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9052,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.0194,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0261,"anger":0.0127,"disgust":0.0221},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel method for double-blinding in low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) studies.

We systematically investigated the effects of PMI on relaxation times, depending on tissue characteristics, in both unfixed and fixed pig brains. Methods: Twelve pig brains (n = 12) were scanned in both unfixed and fixed states at three PMI windows ({approx}12, 24, 48 h). Quantitative T1, T2, and T2* maps were acquired with identical protocols at controlled room temperature (~24 {degrees}C). We assessed the PMI effects on relaxation times in the gray matter (GM) and the white matter (WM) at both group and sample levels, while fixation-induced effects and inter-sample variability were evaluated using pairwise rank correlation and coefficient of variation (CV) visualization. Results: In unfixed tissues, T1 significantly differed among PMI groups in GM (p = 0.0141) and WM (p = 0.0315) in the early window ([≤] 24 h). In the same window, PMIT1 correlations were observed in both GM (r = 0.921, p = 0.007) and WM (r = 0.876, p = 0.013). T2 showed no group differences but exhibited an inverse correlation with PMI in WM (r = -0.849, p = 0.015). No significant PMI-T2* relationships were detected (all p > 0.05). At later PMI (20-50 h), PMI-qMRI correlations diminished. Fixation processes altered all qMRI parameters. Notably, the PMI effects on T1 in the unfixed brains were preserved even after fixation at an ordinal level, although fixation introduced substantial inter-sample variability. Conclusions: PMI exerts the most robust effects on T1. Fixation has a significant impact on qMRI values, mitigating the apparent PMI effect and increasing the inter-sample variability. However, it is still possible to retrieve the PMI effects from fixed brain at the level of rank order, providing practical guidance for further ex vivo qMRI studies on PMI.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681281v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.320437","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":295,"author":"Wang, L., Oishi, N., Urayama, S.-i., Hanakawa, T.","raw_content_length":1868,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.475,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PMI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1865,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Effects","Postmortem Intervals","Quantitative MRI","Unfixed and Fixed Swine Brain","Implications","Ex Vivo MRI Applications","PMI","The postmortem interval","alters","properties"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Unfixed and Fixed Swine Brain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Effects":2.0,"Postmortem Intervals":2.0,"Quantitative MRI":2.0,"Unfixed and Fixed Swine Brain":2.0,"Implications":2.0,"Ex Vivo MRI Applications":2.0,"PMI":2.0,"The postmortem interval":1.0,"alters":1.0,"properties":1.0}},"age_hours":18.736580791944448,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8224,"joy":0.0069,"surprise":0.0472,"sadness":0.0186,"fear":0.0375,"anger":0.011,"disgust":0.0564},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the effects of postmortem intervals on quantitative MRI in pig brains.

Treg therapy for AAA is potentially beneficial but its specific mechanism requires further investigation for clinical applications. Methods: After identifying the critical role of T-cells in AAA using human and mouse AAA single-cell RNA sequencing data, we investigated the influence of Tregs on immune cell infiltration within mouse AAA-specifically CD3+ T cells-using congenic transfer of Thy1.1 allelic donor mice Tregs into AAA-induced wild-type C57BL/6J mice. AAA progression was quantified with ultrasound and image micrometry. Tissues obtained on postoperative days 7-42 were analyzed with flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, Verhoeff-van Gieson staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results: CD3+ T cell population was profoundly elevated in the elastase induced AAA mouse model which was further used in the study. The AAA mice that received Treg cell therapy had less elastin degradation and aortic wall enlargement than their control counterparts. Donor Tregs were detected in draining lymph nodes even after five weeks, with characteristic expression of FOXP3 and CD25. Although donor Tregs were not detected in the aortic microenvironment, the pro-inflammatory cell population including CD4 and CD8 cells was reduced, compared to control mice. Conclusion: Elevated T cell population aggravates inflammation and promotes AAA progression. Treg therapy impedes the recruitment of T cells into AAA tissue by colonizing the draining lymph nodes, thereby mitigating AAA progression. This study deepens our understanding of Treg stability, function, and potential as a promising therapy for early-stage aneurysms.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681290v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:38:25.320737","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Dasari, C., Lopez, J.

{"id":"ai_engadget_e25805e3058a","title":"Ford is cutting the price of the 2026 F","content":"Ford is cutting the price of the 2026 F-150 Lightning by up to $4,000, as confirmed by the automaker to CarsDirect. The price cuts vary by trim, however, and will only apply to more expensive packages for the electric pickup truck. This comes as the $7,500 EV tax credit expired at the end of September. The 2026 model has a starting price of $63,345 for the STX trim, which is the same price as the previous year's entry-level XLT. The STX replaces the XLT and delivers 536 horsepower, up from the XLT's 452, and 290 miles of range, up from 240. The Flash edition will receive the full $4,000 price cut, giving it a new price of $65,995. The Lariat, originally priced at $76,995, will get just a $2,000 haircut and will sell for $74,995. The Platinum edition will be priced at $84,995 and will not cost less. This summer, Ford announced that it would release an affordable midsize all-electric pickup with a starting price of around $30,000 in 2027. The truck would be built on the company's upcoming Ford Universal EV Platform that will be shared by a new family of products. These models would use Ford's upcoming prismatic LFP batteries. As EV-related tax incentives continue to expire, manufacturers will need to reach into their own pockets to deliver value to consumers. This week Tesla announced the Model 3 and Model Y 'Standard' editions, which give up some luxury touches in exchange for price, with both starting at under $40,000. Inflation has also played a large role in car pricing over the last five years, as $40,000 has roughly the same purchasing power as $32,000 in 2020. Ford recently walked back a program that would have enabled dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases even after the expiration of federal subsidies on September 30, as first reported by Reuters. The plan involved having the company’s lending arm purchase new EVs out of the brand’s dealers’ inventory, after which Ford would apply for the tax credit on the vehicles. That credit would then have been considered in the EV lease terms for customers, passing on the savings. GM was set to have a similar program before canceling it earlier this week. According to Reuters sources, GM killed the program after Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio raised concerns about it. It is unclear why Ford followed suit.
