To minimize magnetic Johnson noise from metals, the design features ceramic electric field plates housed in a glass vacuum chamber. To suppress external magnetic noise the apparatus is enclosed within a cylindrical four-layer mu-metal shield with a shielding factor exceeding $10^6$ in one radial direction and $10^5$ in the other. Finite element modelling shows that the difference between these shielding factors is due to imperfect joints between sections of mu-metal. Using atomic magnetometers to monitor the magnetic field inside the shield, we measure noise below 40 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and above, rising to 500 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$ at 0.1 Hz. Analytical and numerical studies show that residual magnetic Johnson noise contributes approximately 13 fT/$\\sqrt{{\\rm Hz}}$. The background magnetic field averaged along the beamline is maintained below 3 pT, with typical gradients of a few nT/m. An electric field of 20 kV/cm is applied without discharges and with leakage currents below 1 nA. Each magnetometer measures the magnetic field correlated with the direction of the applied electric field with a precision of 0.11 fT in 104 hours of data. These results demonstrate that the apparatus is suitable for measuring the electron EDM with precision at the $10^{-31}$ e cm level. The design principles and characterization techniques presented here are broadly applicable to precision measurements probing fundamental symmetries in molecules, atoms, and neutrons.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21725","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.744204","language":"en","tags":["physics","research","preprints","physicsatom-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"F.

In computer vision, a common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10753","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.781903","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Kagan Ozturk, Aman Bhatta, Haiyu Wu, Patrick Flynn, Kevin W.

However, coping with such environments cannot be done through the current network approach of compartmentalizing data as distinct from network operations. Instead, we envision a computing continuum where the content of the transmitted data is considered as an essential element in the transmission of that data, with data sources and streams analyzed and distilled to their essential elements, based on their semantic context, and then processed and transmitted over dedicated slices of network resources. By exploiting the rich content and semantics within data for dynamic and autonomous optimization of the computing continuum, this article opens the door to integrating communication, computing, cyber-physical systems, data flow, and AI, presenting new and exciting opportunities for cross-layer design. We propose semantic slicing, a two-pronged approach that builds multiple virtual divisions within a single physical and data infrastructure, each with its own distinct characteristics and needs. We view semantic slicing as a novel shift from current static slicing techniques, extending existing slicing approaches such that it can be applied dynamically at different levels and categories of resources in the computing continuum. Further it propels the advancement of semantic communication via the proposed architectural framework.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10756","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.782422","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csni","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Mayukh Roy Chowdhury, Eman Hammad, Lauri Loven, Susanna Pirttikangas, Aloizio P da Silva, Walid Saad","raw_content_length":1635,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1634,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Framework","arXiv251010756v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the ensuing ultra-dense and diverse environment","future ac6G communication networks","network resources","mechanisms","the diversity","density","dynamicity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Framework":2.0,"arXiv251010756v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the ensuing ultra-dense and diverse environment":1.0,"future ac6G communication networks":1.0,"network resources":1.0,"mechanisms":1.0,"the diversity":1.0,"density":1.0,"dynamicity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7535892613888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9218,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.0249,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0194,"anger":0.0125,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a new framework for AI-driven network optimization, which could potentially reduce energy consumption in communication networks by dynamically allocating resources.

Thus, this work aims to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty) gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot, ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks, including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10759","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.782854","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Arthicha Srisuchinnawong, Poramate Manoonpong","raw_content_length":1604,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Embodied Regulation"],"persons":["ROGER"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1603,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gain Tuning","What","You","Gain Adaptation","Constrained Locomotion Learning","arXiv251010759v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Existing robot locomotion learning techniques","the offline selection","proper reward"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Gain Tuning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gain Tuning":2.0,"What":2.0,"You":2.0,"Gain Adaptation":2.0,"Constrained Locomotion Learning":2.0,"arXiv251010759v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Existing robot locomotion learning techniques":1.0,"the offline selection":1.0,"proper reward":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753604282777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.605,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.921,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9398,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0153,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0066,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0075},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach (ROGER) to robot locomotion learning, achieving near-zero constraint violation and up to 50% more primary reward compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

On Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs). However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no protocol-level support for content moderation. We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD, where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.

Here, using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180 full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently misinterpreted keywords like \"longitudinal\" or \"sensitivity\" as automatic evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence synthesis across diverse scientific fields.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10762","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.783663","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","statap","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Wenqing Zhang, Trang Nguyen, Elizabeth A.

Specific morphological lesion characteristics were observed to contribute to the occurrence of in-stent restenosis. Local mechanical factors, such as stresses and strains, are known to influence tissue adaptation after stent implantation. However, the influence of morphological features on those local mechanical states and, hence, on the occurrence of in-stent restenosis remains understudied. This work investigates the correlation between local mechanical quantities and in-stent restenosis by evaluating the stress distributions in the artery wall during and after stent implantation for informative lesion morphologies. We perform computational simulations of the stenting procedure with physics-based patient-specific coronary artery models. Different morphologies are assessed using the spatial plaque composition information from high-resolution coronary computed tomography angiography data. We quantify the correlation between in-stent restenosis and local tensional stresses. We found that specific morphological characteristics like circumferential or asymmetric block calcifications result in higher stresses in the surrounding tissue.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_73d77023c3ea","title":"Optimally Deep Networks -","content":"arXiv:2510.10764v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10764","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.784469","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen, Filza Khan Tareen","raw_content_length":1560,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NAS","Optimally Deep Networks"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1559,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimally Deep Networks","arXiv251010764v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Deep neural networks","DNNs","brilliant performance","various tasks","this success","the cost","unnecessarily large model sizes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimally Deep Networks":2.0,"arXiv251010764v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Deep neural networks":1.0,"DNNs":1.0,"brilliant performance":1.0,"various tasks":1.0,"this success":1.0,"the cost":1.0,"unnecessarily large model sizes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753664221111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.964,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7928,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8933,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0633,"sadness":0.008,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0056},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel training strategy (progressive depth expansion) for deep neural networks that reduces computational demands and memory footprint.

This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\\epsilon}) in real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning. To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%, 99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively.

In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout. Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated using higher-stochasticity SDE training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10767","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.785671","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","mathoc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Jiayuan Sheng, Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, David D.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8f6facde5837","title":"Preconditioned Norms: A Unified Framework for Steepest Descent, Quasi","content":"arXiv:2510.10777v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order, whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and sufficient conditions under generalized norms.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ecdfd2dbd992","title":"Real2USD: Scene Representations in Universal Scene Description Language","content":"arXiv:2510.10778v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2 quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d2240c500a06","title":"Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.10779v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.\\\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10779","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.788172","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Theo Di Piazza, Carole Lazarus, Olivier Nempont, Loic Boussel","raw_content_length":1691,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Vision Transformers","3D Chest CT","Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Multi arXiv:2510.10779v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1690,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Structured Spectral Graph Learning","Multi","Announce Type","new Abstract","the growing volume","CT examinations","an increasing demand","automated tools","organ segmentation","abnormality detection"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Structured Spectral Graph Learning":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the growing volume":1.0,"CT examinations":1.0,"an increasing demand":1.0,"automated tools":1.0,"organ segmentation":1.0,"abnormality detection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753801106944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.36,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8573,"joy":0.0076,"surprise":0.0637,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0436,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the efficiency of medical image analysis using a novel graph-based framework.

We proposed the two-dimensional graph bi-fractional Fourier transform (2D-GBFRFT), which assigns independent fractional orders to the factor graphs of a Cartesian product while preserving separability. We established invertibility, unitarity, and index additivity, and developed two filtering schemes: a Wiener-style design through grid search and a differentiable framework that jointly optimizes transform orders and diagonal spectral filters. We further introduced a hybrid interpolation with the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRFT), controlled by a tunable parameter that balances the two methods. In the domains of synthetic Cartesian product graph signals, authentic temporal graph datasets, and dynamic image deblurring, 2D-GBFRFT consistently surpasses 2D-GFRFT and enhances JFRFT.

The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains. We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics.

Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies, including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO), and model ensemble methods.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2d690466761b","title":"BioOSS: A Bio","content":"arXiv:2510.10790v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models, which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS) designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity.

However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead, we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation, allowing the user to make localized edits.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10793","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.790590","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Rolandos Alexandros Potamias, Stathis Galanakis, Jiankang Deng, Athanasios Papaioannou, Stefanos Zafeiriou","raw_content_length":1302,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1301,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ImHead","Announce Type","new Abstract","the last years","3D morphable models","the-art","modeling","expressive 3D avatars","their reliance","a strict topology"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ImHead":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the last years":1.0,"3D morphable models":1.0,"the-art":1.0,"modeling":1.0,"expressive 3D avatars":1.0,"their reliance":1.0,"a strict topology":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7538873441666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8662,"joy":0.0328,"surprise":0.0727,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0104,"disgust":0.0051},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel 3D morphable model (imHead) for generating expressive 3D head avatars.

In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells (Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC). This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better represent the complexity of the input images.

However, their superiority in predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when developing and evaluating deep learning models.

This limitation is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical validation.

Instead of applying explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e95d20ba00f9","title":"Representing Data in Robotic Tactile Perception -","content":"arXiv:2510.10804v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision, which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware, representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the task at hand.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10804","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.794724","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Alessandro Albini, Mohsen Kaboli, Giorgio Cannata, Perla Maiolino","raw_content_length":1487,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Representing Data","Data Representation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1486,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Data","Robotic Tactile Perception","Announce Type","new Abstract","Robotic tactile perception","a complex process","several computational steps","different levels","Tactile information","the interplay"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Data":2.0,"Robotic Tactile Perception":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Robotic tactile perception":1.0,"a complex process":1.0,"several computational steps":1.0,"different levels":1.0,"Tactile information":1.0,"the interplay":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7539785769444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.805,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.561,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8976,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0569,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.008,"anger":0.0114,"disgust":0.0093},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper is a survey of data representation methods in robotic tactile perception.

While these systems increase accessibility, scalability, and personalization, their integration into mental health care brings privacy and safety challenges that have not been well-examined. Unlike traditional clinical interactions, LLM-mediated therapy often lacks a clear structure for what information is collected, how it is processed, and how it is stored or reused. Users without clinical guidance may over-disclose personal information, which is sometimes irrelevant to their presenting concern, due to misplaced trust, lack of awareness of data risks, or the conversational design of the system. This overexposure raises privacy concerns and also increases the potential for LLM bias, misinterpretation, and long-term data misuse.

A RAG Approach for Tree","content":"arXiv:2510.10806v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.795553","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","preprints","research","cscl","csir","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Mihir Gupte, Paolo Giusto, Ramesh S","raw_content_length":1322,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG"],"persons":["RAG","RAG Approach"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1321,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Knowledge Enough","A RAG Approach","Tree","responses","structured data","arXiv251010806v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"Knowledge Enough":2.0,"A RAG Approach":2.0,"Tree":2.0,"responses":2.0,"structured data":2.0,"arXiv251010806v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.754009583333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.664,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9328,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9267,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0285,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.0064,"anger":0.0107,"disgust":0.0149},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel method for improving the efficiency of RAG systems when dealing with hierarchical data, showing a 68% reduction in the number of documents retrieved.

In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator.

Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility. Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms) or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks that is on par with baseline approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10810","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.796385","language":"en","tags":["cslg","preprints","research","csdb","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Omar Islam Laskar, Fatemeh Ramezani Khozestani, Ishika Nankani, Sohrab Namazi Nia, Senjuti Basu Roy, Kaustubh Beedkar","raw_content_length":1623,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1622,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Aegis","A Correlation","arXiv251010810v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Data-sharing ecosystems","entities","providers","consumers","intermediaries","access"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Aegis":2.0,"A Correlation":2.0,"arXiv251010810v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Data-sharing ecosystems":1.0,"entities":1.0,"providers":1.0,"consumers":1.0,"intermediaries":1.0,"access":1.0}},"age_hours":2.754041016388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9372,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0145,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.0145,"disgust":0.0105},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a middleware framework (AEGIS) for optimizing data masking configurations to maximize dataset utility while preserving privacy.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9905416247cc","title":"LLMs as Strategic Agents: Beliefs, Best Response Behavior, and Emergent Heuristics","content":"arXiv:2510.10813v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents, revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity, explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10813","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.796938","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csgt","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Enric Junque de Fortuny, Veronica Roberta Cappelli","raw_content_length":1602,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1601,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Strategic Agents","Beliefs","Best Response Behavior","Emergent Heuristics","reasoning","arXiv251010813v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","domains"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"Strategic Agents":2.0,"Beliefs":2.0,"Best Response Behavior":2.0,"Emergent Heuristics":2.0,"reasoning":2.0,"arXiv251010813v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"domains":1.0}},"age_hours":2.754056053611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.91,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.047,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0066,"anger":0.0163,"disgust":0.0089},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the strategic thinking capabilities of LLMs, showing they can exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_4b8486301e26","title":"DRIFT: Decompose, Retrieve, Illustrate, then Formalize Theorems","content":"arXiv:2510.10815v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10815","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.797362","language":"en","tags":["csai","preprints","research","cscl","csir","cssc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Meiru Zhang, Philipp Borchert, Milan Gritta, Gerasimos Lampouras","raw_content_length":1607,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models","Mathlib","DRIFT","Formalize Theorems arXiv:2510.10815v1 Announce Type:"],"persons":[],"locations":["Lean"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1606,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DRIFT","Decompose","Retrieve","Illustrate","Formalize Theorems","LLMs","arXiv251010815v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the formalization","mathematical statements"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DRIFT":2.0,"Decompose":2.0,"Retrieve":2.0,"Illustrate":2.0,"Formalize Theorems":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv251010815v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the formalization":1.0,"mathematical statements":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7540701183333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.003,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2006,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9216,"joy":0.0029,"surprise":0.0287,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0138,"anger":0.0145,"disgust":0.0091},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel framework (DRIFT) for improving the autoformalization of mathematical statements using LLMs. The concrete action is the development and evaluation of this framework on benchmark datasets, with measurable outcomes such as improved F1 score and BEq+@10.

In this work, we present a comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques, including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10822","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.799460","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Clemence Mottez, Louisa Fay, Maya Varma, Sophie Ostmeier, Curtis Langlotz","raw_content_length":1638,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1637,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Detection","Mitigation","Addressing Bias","Deep Learning Models","Chest X","chest X","rays","arXiv251010822v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Deep learning models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Learning Models","Deep learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Detection":2.0,"Mitigation":2.0,"Addressing Bias":2.0,"Deep Learning Models":2.0,"Chest X":2.0,"chest X":2.0,"rays":2.0,"arXiv251010822v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Deep learning models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7541318219444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3225,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0064,"sadness":0.0131,"fear":0.5752,"anger":0.0407,"disgust":0.0372},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a method to reduce bias in deep learning models for chest X-rays, improving fairness across demographic groups.

For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10823","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.799899","language":"en","tags":["csai","preprints","research","csne","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Daniel Howard","raw_content_length":1414,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Irrational Machine: Neurosis","the Limits of Algorithmic Safety"],"persons":["Announce Type","metric mismatch"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1413,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Irrational Machine","Neurosis","the Limits","Algorithmic Safety","arXiv251010823v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a framework","neurosis","embodied AI","behaviors"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Algorithmic Safety"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Irrational Machine":2.0,"Neurosis":2.0,"the Limits":2.0,"Algorithmic Safety":2.0,"arXiv251010823v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a framework":1.0,"neurosis":1.0,"embodied AI":1.0,"behaviors":1.0}},"age_hours":2.754146908055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2105,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7579,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6712,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0284,"sadness":0.0211,"fear":0.2274,"anger":0.025,"disgust":0.0209},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a framework for characterizing and detecting neurosis in AI, but it is theoretical and at the basic research stage.

However, existing financial RAG systems face two significant challenges: (1) they struggle to process heterogeneous data formats, such as text, tables, and figures; and (2) they encounter difficulties in balancing general-domain applicability with company-specific adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we present VeritasFi, an innovative hybrid RAG framework that incorporates a multi-modal preprocessing pipeline alongside a cutting-edge two-stage training strategy for its re-ranking component. VeritasFi enhances financial QA through three key innovations: (1) A multi-modal preprocessing pipeline that seamlessly transforms heterogeneous data into a coherent, machine-readable format. (2) A tripartite hybrid retrieval engine that operates in parallel, combining deep multi-path retrieval over a semantically indexed document corpus, real-time data acquisition through tool utilization, and an expert-curated memory bank for high-frequency questions, ensuring comprehensive scope, accuracy, and efficiency. (3) A two-stage training strategy for the document re-ranker, which initially constructs a general, domain-specific model using anonymized data, followed by rapid fine-tuning on company-specific data for targeted applications. By integrating our proposed designs, VeritasFi presents a groundbreaking framework that greatly enhances the adaptability and robustness of financial RAG systems, providing a scalable solution for both general-domain and company-specific QA tasks.

This paper investigates an application of PAs to enable physical-layer security (PLS) by enlarging the channel condition diversity between legitimate users (LUs) and eavesdroppers (Eves). Particularly, we focus on the dual-waveguide scenario, where the two waveguides employs multiple PAs to serve multiple LUs in the presence of an Eve. Specifically, we consider two waveguide placement strategies, i.e., parallel placement and orthogonal placement. Meanwhile, we incorporate two channel models, i.e., in-waveguide phase shifts, and in-waveguide phase shifts and attenuation. We formulate the secure sum rate (SSR) and secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problems, and propose a two-stage algorithm to solve them. The first stage adopts a particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with an improved feasibility module, termed FeaPSO, for PA placement, and the second stage employs the successive convex approximate (SCA) method to optimize beamforming and artificial noise vectors. Furthermore, we conduct numerical comparisons between the two placement strategies in terms of average performance and a special case where an Eve is positioned in front of LUs. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that PAs can significantly improve both SSR and SEE. Additionally, the necessity of orthogonal waveguide placement is explicitly verified.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11044","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.696447","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Yang Lu, Xinke Xie, Yanqing Xu, Bo Ai, Octavia A.

However, most fusion strategies are applied uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up to $+13\\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures, where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs without incurring high computational costs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10849","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.804979","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Donald Loveland, Yao-An Yang, Danai Koutra","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.09,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models","LLM-GNN","LLM","Node arXiv:2510.10849v1 Announce Type","GNN"],"persons":["Neighbor-"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1546,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Glance","Context","Node","arXiv251010849v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","text-attributed graphs","the use","Large Language Models","graph learning"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":4.0,"Glance":2.0,"Context":2.0,"Node":2.0,"arXiv251010849v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"text-attributed graphs":1.0,"the use":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"graph learning":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7543323175,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8477,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.021,"sadness":0.0126,"fear":0.0188,"anger":0.0529,"disgust":0.0389},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (GLANCE) for improving graph neural network performance by selectively leveraging large language models.

The primary goal is to identify and mitigate potential sampling biases attributed to orbit selection during pre-Phase A mission studies. This methodology supports current incubation activities for a future Planetary Boundary Layer observing system by incorporating a sampling effectiveness measure into a broader architectural study. The study evaluates the effectiveness of 20 satellite configurations for observing convective storm activity in the Southwestern U.S. during the North American Monsoon (NAM) season. The primary design variables are the number of satellites, orbit type (sun-synchronous or inclined), and Local Time of Ascending Node (LTAN). Using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to assess observational representativeness and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to estimate probability density functions, the study quantifies the discrepancy between observed and ground truth storm features. Results indicate that a two-satellite sun-synchronous system with an 8:00 PM LTAN, achieved the lowest KL divergence, signifying the most representative observation of storm clusters. In contrast, single-satellite configurations, particularly those with late-night LTANs (e.g., 12:00 AM), demonstrated significantly higher KL divergence. The study concludes that dual-satellite configurations in sun-synchronous orbits with evening LTANs outperform single-satellite and inclined configurations in capturing representative convective storm activity.

By leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching -- for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these.

Most existing works adopt a simplified approach - using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing.

Existing methods often rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and grid-conditioned control.

Traditional processors struggle to handle this data volume efficiently, making in-storage computing (ISP) a promising alternative. This work introduces an ISP architecture leveraging a 3D Ferroelectric NAND (FeNAND) structure, providing significantly higher density, faster speeds, and lower voltage requirements compared to traditional NAND flash. Despite its superior density, the NAND structure has not been widely utilized in ISP applications due to limited throughput associated with row-by-row reads from serially connected cells. To overcome these limitations, we integrate hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a brain-inspired paradigm that enables highly parallel processing with simple operations and strong error tolerance. By combining HDC with the proposed dual-bound approximate matching (D-BAM) distance metric, tailored to the FeNAND structure, we parallelize vector computations to enable efficient MS spectral library search, achieving 43x speedup and 21x higher energy efficiency over state-of-the-art 3D NAND methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10872","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.809054","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csar","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Sumukh Pinge, Ashkan Moradifirouzabadi, Keming Fan, Prasanna Venkatesan Ravindran, Tanvir H.

The algorithm integrates a multilevel correction framework with an optimized implementation strategy. Within this framework, a series of linearized boundary value problems are solved, and their approximate solutions are corrected by solving small-scale Hartree--Fock equations in low-dimensional correction spaces. The correction space comprises a coarse space and the solution to the linearized boundary value problem, enabling high accuracy while preserving low-dimensional characteristics. The proposed algorithm efficiently addresses the inherent computational complexity of the Hartree--Fock equation. Innovative correction strategies eliminate the need for direct computation of large-scale nonlinear eigenvalue systems and dense matrix operations. Furthermore, optimization techniques based on precomputations within the correction space render the total computational workload nearly independent of the number of self-consistent field iterations. This approach significantly accelerates the solution process of the Hartree--Fock equation, effectively mitigating the traditional exponential scaling demands on computational resources while maintaining precision.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10879","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.810265","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Fei Xu","raw_content_length":1416,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hartree arXiv:2510.10879v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1415,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Multilevel correction type","adaptive finite element method","Hartree","arXiv251010879v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","an efficient algorithm","the Hartree--Fock equation","a multilevel correction scheme","an adaptive refinement technique"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["an efficient algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Multilevel correction type":2.0,"adaptive finite element method":2.0,"Hartree":2.0,"arXiv251010879v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"an efficient algorithm":1.0,"the Hartree--Fock equation":1.0,"a multilevel correction scheme":1.0,"an adaptive refinement technique":1.0}},"age_hours":2.754510104722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.623,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9246,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.448,"joy":0.4411,"surprise":0.0772,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0173,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes an algorithm to improve the computational efficiency of solving the Hartree-Fock equation, which is used in quantum chemistry and materials science.

A Vision","content":"arXiv:2510.10880v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches 34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases, achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization.

A standard autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights, specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10886","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.811504","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Yashom Dighe, Youngjin Kim, Karthik Dantu","raw_content_length":1347,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1346,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["QuayPoints","A Reasoning Framework","Bridge","the Information Gap","Global","Local Planning","Autonomous Racing","arXiv251010886v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Autonomous racing"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"QuayPoints":2.0,"A Reasoning Framework":2.0,"Bridge":2.0,"the Information Gap":2.0,"Global":2.0,"Local Planning":2.0,"Autonomous Racing":2.0,"arXiv251010886v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Autonomous racing":1.0}},"age_hours":2.754556126388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.742,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8805,"joy":0.0068,"surprise":0.0601,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.017,"anger":0.0238,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a reasoning framework (QuayPoints) to improve autonomous racing.
