{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_3f8740d7550c","title":"Doden in Mexico door overstromingen en aardverschuivingen","content":"In Mexico zijn zeker 24 mensen om het leven gekomen door noodweer. Op verschillende plekken in het land zijn overstromingen en aardverschuivingen ontstaan door aanhoudende regen. In de centrale deelstaat Hidalgo zijn zestien mensen om het leven gekomen door aardverschuivingen. Zeker duizend huizen, 59 ziekenhuizen en klinieken en ruim 300 scholen hebben schade opgeholpen. Zeventien van de 84 gemeenten zitten zonder stroom. In de aangrenzende deelstaat Puebla vielen zeker vijf doden en worden nog elf mensen vermist. Vijftien mensen, onder wie enkele kinderen, zitten vast op daken. In Querétaro werd een zesjarig kind bedolven onder een rots en modder bij een aardverschuiving. In het oosten van het land, in de deelstraat Veracruz, trad de rivier Cazones buiten haar oevers, waardoor de stad Poza Rica te maken kreeg met hoogwater. Ook hier wachten mensen op daken en in bomen om gered te worden. Volgens de gouverneur van de deelstaat is 35 procent van de 190.000 inwoners van Poza Rica getroffen door het water. Honderden mensen zijn opgevangen op noodlocaties. Naar verwachting houdt de regen in Mexico nog een paar dagen aan. Het regenseizoen in Mexico duurt nog tot begin november.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586023","published_date":"2025-10-10T23:41:10","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:43:29.312895","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":189,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1274,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Cazones","Puebla","Veracruz"],"locations":["Hidalgo","Querétaro","Mexico"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1192,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["aardverschuivingen","overstromingen","Doden","leven","zeker 24 mensen","noodweer","verschillende plekken","het land","aanhoudende regen","de centrale deelstaat"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"aardverschuivingen":4.0,"overstromingen":3.0,"Doden":2.0,"leven":2.0,"zeker 24 mensen":1.0,"noodweer":1.0,"verschillende plekken":1.0,"het land":1.0,"aanhoudende regen":1.0,"de centrale deelstaat":1.0}},"age_hours":2.1422386688888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.605,"joy":0.0329,"surprise":0.2182,"sadness":0.0422,"fear":0.0316,"anger":0.0362,"disgust":0.0339},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reports on the impact of extreme weather events, specifically overflooding and landslides, resulting in casualties and damage to infrastructure.

Acht kinderen zijn de afgelopen 24 uur herenigd met hun families, zei ze op een persconferentie in het Witte Huis. Melania Trump vertelde dat ze haar man in augustus een brief had meegegeven naar zijn ontmoeting met de Russische president Poetin in Alaska. In die brief, die president Trump persoonlijk aan Poetin zou hebben overhandigd, riep ze op tot vrede en bescherming van kinderen. Ze deed een beroep op de verantwoordelijkheid van de Russische president om hun onschuld te beschermen. Directe lijn Poetin stuurde haar een brief terug, zei ze op de persconferentie. Daarin liet hij volgens haar zien \"dat hij bereid was om direct met mij te communiceren en hij deelde details over de Oekraïense kinderen in Rusland. Sindsdien hebben we een directe lijn om het te hebben over het welbevinden van deze kinderen\". \"De afgelopen drie maanden hebben beide partijen deelgenomen aan verschillende geheime bijeenkomsten en telefoongesprekken, allemaal in goed vertrouwen\", zei ze. \"We hebben afgesproken om met elkaar samen te werken ten behoeve van alle mensen die bij deze oorlog betrokken zijn.\" Een van haar vertegenwoordigers werkte direct samen met Poetins team om de veilige hereniging met de kinderen te garanderen, liet ze weten. Volgens de first lady is er nog steeds contact en zijn er plannen om nog meer Oekraïense kinderen met hun ouders te herenigen. Arrestatiebevel Tegen Poetin is door het Internationaal Strafhof (ICC) in Den Haag een arrestatiebevel uitgevaardigd vanwege Russische oorlogsmisdaden in Oekraïne. Het ICC noemt de deportatie van kinderen uit Oekraïne naar Rusland daarbij als hoofdreden. Onafhankelijke onderzoekers stelden vast dat minstens 6000 kinderen daarheen zijn gebracht.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586012","published_date":"2025-10-10T20:59:50","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:43:29.314336","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":295,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2290,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.475,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Melania Trump","Trump","Poetin","Rusla"],"locations":["Rusland","Alaska","Oekraïne"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1915,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Oekraïense kinderen terug","familie","brief","hun families","De Amerikaanse first","de terugkeer","enkele Oekraïense kinderen","die","de oorlog","kinderen"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Oekraïense kinderen terug":2.0,"familie":2.0,"brief":2.0,"hun families":2.0,"De Amerikaanse first":1.0,"de terugkeer":1.0,"enkele Oekraïense kinderen":1.0,"die":1.0,"de oorlog":1.0,"kinderen":1.0}},"age_hours":4.831157993888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5848,"joy":0.0171,"surprise":0.0476,"sadness":0.0378,"fear":0.1681,"anger":0.084,"disgust":0.0606},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the return of eight Ukrainian children to their families, facilitated by diplomatic efforts.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_9f92b18e2441","title":"Lecornu dagen na eigen ontslag opnieuw benoemd tot premier van Frankrijk","content":"De Franse president Macron heeft Sébastien Lecornu opnieuw benoemd tot premier van Frankrijk. Dat meldt het Élysée, het presidentieel paleis. Eerder deze week had Lecornu zelf nog zijn ontslag ingediend, nog geen maand na zijn benoeming. Lecornu heeft nu opnieuw de taak gekregen een nieuw kabinet te vormen, zo staat in de verklaring van president Macron. \"We moeten de politieke crisis beëindigen\", reageerde Lecornu. Frankrijk verkeert al enige tijd in een politieke crisis. Sinds het aantreden van president Macron in 2017 zijn al zeven premiers de revue gepasseerd. President Macron heeft met zijn regering een minderheid in het parlement. Kritische reacties Het was de bedoeling dat met Lecornu de rust weder zou keren, maar dat gebeurde niet. Lecornu volgde ex-premier Bayrou vorige maand op, die na negen maanden door het parlement werd weggestuurd omdat hij onvoldoende steun kreeg voor zijn voorgestelde miljardenbezuinigingen. Lecornu was nog geen maand bezig en had net de ministersposten opnieuw toebedeeld toen hij opstapte. Partijen waren ontevreden over de invulling van de posten, er kwam veel kritiek vanuit het parlement en er hing een motie van wantrouwen in de lucht. Of het Lecornu nu wel gaat lukken de crisis af te wenden, valt nog te bezien. Verschillende partijen reageren nu al kritisch op zijn nieuwe aantreden. Jordan Bardella, van de radicaal-rechtse partij Rassemblement National, reageert dat zijn partij een nieuwe regering-Lecornu zal wegstemmen. Begroting De voornaamste taak van Lecornu was om de parlementsbegroting rond te krijgen. In een toespraak bij zijn ontslag zei hij dat hij daarvoor compromissen wilde sluiten, maar dat de partijen met wie hij samenwerkte die compromissen niet zagen zitten. Na zijn ontslag vroeg president Macron aan Lecornu om een laatste poging te wagen de politieke crisis op te lossen, zodat nieuwe verkiezingen uit zouden blijven. Hiervoor voerde Lecornu woensdag gesprekken met partijleiders, in de hoop toch een begroting rond te krijgen. De gesprekken waren volgens Lecornu positief. Woensdag zei hij dat de partijen bereid waren tot het sluiten van een overeenkomst. De nu opnieuw benoemde premier ziet de hervorming van het Franse pensioenstelsel als de grootste uitdaging. Veel partijen willen dat de verhoging van de pensioengerechtigde leeftijd wordt teruggedraaid, maar volgens Lecornu zou dat alleen in 2027 al 3 miljard euro gaan kosten. Onjuiste informatie op cv Bij zijn aantreden in september was er ook andere kritiek op Lecornu. De politicus had jarenlang onjuiste informatie op zijn cv staan. Zo zei hij een masterdiploma in de rechten te hebben behaald aan een universiteit in Parijs, terwijl hij er slechts een jaar had gestudeerd en de opleiding niet afrondde.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586008","published_date":"2025-10-10T20:42:35","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:43:29.315656","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":426,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3676,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Lecornu"],"persons":["President Macron","Lecornu de rust","Lecornu","Bayrou","Sébastien Lecornu"],"locations":["Frankrijk"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2749,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["premier","Lecornu dagen","eigen ontslag","De Franse president","het presidentieel paleis","Eerder deze week","zijn ontslag","nog geen maand","zijn benoeming","de taak"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"premier":3.0,"Lecornu dagen":2.0,"eigen ontslag":2.0,"De Franse president":1.0,"het presidentieel paleis":1.0,"Eerder deze week":1.0,"zijn ontslag":1.0,"nog geen maand":1.0,"zijn benoeming":1.0,"de taak":1.0}},"age_hours":5.118673032777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6696,"joy":0.0228,"surprise":0.1069,"sadness":0.0494,"fear":0.0415,"anger":0.0486,"disgust":0.0611},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a political crisis in France related to budget negotiations and pension reform.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_572431fe3371","title":"Gardisten op straat in Memphis, rechter blokkeert inzet in Chicago en Portland","content":"De Nationale Garde is begonnen met patrouilleren in Memphis, in de Amerikaanse staat Tennessee. De militairen worden begeleid door de lokale politie, schrijven Amerikaanse media. De komst van de gardisten is onderdeel van een plan van de Amerikaanse president Trump, die zo misdaad zegt te willen aanpakken en protesten tegen zijn immigratiebeleid de kop in wil drukken. De inzet van de Nationale Garde in steden met een Democratisch bestuur wordt momenteel in federale rechtbanken aangevochten. Het is nog niet duidelijk hoeveel gardisten er in Memphis zijn en hoeveel troepen er op korte termijn bij zullen komen. De Democratische burgemeester van de stad heeft gezegd dat hij nooit om de Nationale Garde heeft gevraagd, maar de Republikeinse gouverneur van Tennessee ging akkoord met de inzet van ordetroepen. Verkeer regelen Nadien zei burgemeester Young dat hij wil dat gardisten zich richten op het bestrijden van geweldsmisdrijven in de stad en niet op intimidatie van burgers. \"We willen er zeker van zijn dat de federale inzet in Memphis en die vanuit de staat maar één doel heeft: het verheffen van onze gemeenschap en het bespoedigen van een veiligere, betere toekomst\", aldus Young. In Memphis is het al jaren relatief onveilig. De lokale korpschef van de politie zei te hopen dat de militairen het verkeer gaan regelen, aanwezig zullen zijn in winkelgebieden en vooral geen \"checkpoints\" zullen oprichten. Gardisten zullen ongewapend zijn en mogen geen mensen arresteren, tenzij de politie hen dat vraagt, benadrukte de gouverneur eerder. 'Onnodig en illegaal' In Chicago mag de Nationale Garde voorlopig de straat niet meer op, oordeelde een federale rechter gisteren. Volgens de rechter is er onvoldoende bewijs dat er in de staat Illinois, waarin Chicago ligt, gevaar dreigt van een opstand tegen het immigratiebeleid van Trump. Een president mag volgens een Amerikaanse wet uit 1807 alleen militairen naar een staat sturen als een opstand daar niet gestopt kan worden door de staat zelf, of als het bestuur van de staat de federale wetten niet in acht neemt. Het Democratische bestuur van Illinois en dat van Chicago noemden de komst van de Nationale Garde eerder al onnodig en illegaal. De gardisten mogen van de rechter in ieder geval tot en met 23 oktober niet meer worden ingezet in de stad. Het is nog niet bekend wat de 500 troepen, die op een legerbasis ten zuidwesten van Chicago verblijven, tot die tijd zullen doen. De regering van president Trump gaat in hoger beroep tegen de uitspraak. Portland Ook in Portland in de staat Oregon zijn er op dit moment geen gardisten op straat. Een door Trump aangestelde federale rechter verbood vorige week zaterdag de inzet van troepen uit de staat zelf. Maandag blokkeerde ze ook Trumps manier om dat bevel te omzeilen; de president was van plan om gardisten uit Californië naar Portland te sturen. Het ging om troepen die eerder in Los Angeles waren ingezet. Volgens Trump zijn de betogingen in Portland tegen het immigratiebeleid uit de hand gelopen. Hij noemde de stad eerder \"verscheurd door oorlog\". Het lokale bestuur benadrukt dat daar helemaal geen sprake van is; inwoners van de stad maken de claims van de president op sociale media belachelijk. In onder meer deze steden wil Trump de Nationale Garde op straat hebben:","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586004","published_date":"2025-10-10T19:56:27","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:43:29.317200","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":537,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3880,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.685,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nationale Garde"],"persons":["Trump","Memphis","Tennessee","Young"],"locations":["Memphis","Chicago","Portland","Tennessee"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3295,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gardisten","straat","rechter","Garde","patrouilleren","de Amerikaanse staat","De militairen","de lokale politie","Amerikaanse media","De komst"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["De militairen"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gardisten":2.0,"straat":2.0,"rechter":2.0,"Garde":2.0,"patrouilleren":1.0,"de Amerikaanse staat":1.0,"De militairen":1.0,"de lokale politie":1.0,"Amerikaanse media":1.0,"De komst":1.0}},"age_hours":5.887576589722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5389,"joy":0.0066,"surprise":0.0473,"sadness":0.0254,"fear":0.0532,"anger":0.2699,"disgust":0.0586},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the deployment of the National Guard in several US cities.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_5ec10435b2d1","title":"Wethouder in gesprek met man die haar met de dood bedreigde: 'Gaf rust'","content":"Wethouder Shalandra Hitipeuw van de gemeente Vijfheerenlanden is onlangs in gesprek gegaan met een man die haar met de dood bedreigde. De 39-jarige man moest vandaag voor de rechter verschijnen. De man schreef onder meer op Facebook dat de wethouder publiekelijk moest worden opgehangen. Hij schreef dat in aanloop naar een bewonersbijeenkomst over een nieuwe asielopvang in Vianen, dat in de gemeente Vijfheerenlanden ligt. De man werd aangehouden wegens opruiing en bedreiging. De bedreigingen maakten indruk, zegt Hitipeuw tegen RTV Utrecht. \"Het heeft niet alleen impact op mij, maar ook op mijn familie. Het geeft een heel onrustig gevoel. Je weet niet waar iemand toe in staat is. Zeker in deze tijd.\" 'Echt berouw' De wethouder wilde daarom met haar bedreiger in gesprek. \"Zolang diegene voor mij geen gezicht heeft, kan het iedereen zijn die mij iets kan aandoen.\" Het gesprek heeft ze als zeer positief ervaren. \"Het was een heel nette meneer die vanaf moment één echt berouw toonde. Hij keek me recht in de ogen en zei: 'Weet dat ik je nooit wat zou aandoen'. Dat gaf rust.\" Ook de 39-jarige man waardeerde het gesprek. \"Ik was blij dat ik haar in de ogen kon kijken en kon melden: dit was niet de bedoeling, ik ben geen slecht persoon. We hebben elkaar de hand geschud en zijn samen naar buiten gelopen.\" 'Niet te zware straf' Hitipeuw vroeg de rechtbank na het gesprek om de man een \"niet te zware\" straf op te leggen.
