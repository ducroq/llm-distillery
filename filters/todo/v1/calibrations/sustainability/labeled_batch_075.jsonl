Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08981","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.643700","language":"en","tags":["research","csse","csai","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Mandira Roy, Novarun Deb, Nabendu Chaki, Agostino Cortesi","raw_content_length":1405,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Sustainability Enhanced Engineering of","the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1404,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SEER","Sustainability Enhanced Engineering","Software Requirements","arXiv251008981v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The rapid expansion","software development","the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","developers","sustainable practices"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability Enhanced Engineering"],"engineering":["software development","the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SEER":2.0,"Sustainability Enhanced Engineering":2.0,"Software Requirements":2.0,"arXiv251008981v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The rapid expansion":1.0,"software development":1.0,"the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals":1.0,"developers":1.0,"sustainable practices":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7634316372222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9447,"joy":0.0172,"surprise":0.0117,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework (SEER) for identifying and optimizing sustainability requirements in software development.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f0ecd79acb61","title":"FedL2T: Personalized Federated Learning with Two","content":"arXiv:2510.08984v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client. Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition, a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08984","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.644118","language":"en","tags":["csne","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Jionghao Lou, Jian Zhang, Zhongmei Li, Lanlan Chen, Enbo Feng","raw_content_length":1802,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Federated Learning","EEG"],"persons":[],"locations":["FedL2"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1801,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FedL2T","Personalized Federated Learning","arXiv251008984v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The training","deep learning models","seizure prediction","large amounts","Electroencephalogram EEG data","sufficient labeled EEG data"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["The training","deep learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FedL2T":2.0,"Personalized Federated Learning":2.0,"arXiv251008984v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The training":1.0,"deep learning models":1.0,"seizure prediction":1.0,"large amounts":1.0,"Electroencephalogram EEG data":1.0,"sufficient labeled EEG data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7634467127777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9335,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0236,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0154,"anger":0.0075,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel federated learning framework (FedL2T) for seizure prediction using EEG data.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_540d1a898d6f","title":"Rethinking Reasoning in Document Ranking: Why Chain","content":"arXiv:2510.08985v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Document reranking is a key component in information retrieval (IR), aimed at refining initial retrieval results to improve ranking quality for downstream tasks. Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun incorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based rerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of reasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks, including reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks (BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform their direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite substantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core limitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and biases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which inflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii) in listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance and fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning shortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain more stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption that explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by highlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for pointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to mitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08985","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.644551","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csir","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Xuan Lu, Haohang Huang, Rui Meng, Yaohui Jin, Wenjun Zeng, Xiaoyu Shen","raw_content_length":1778,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","CoT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1777,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reasoning","Document Ranking","arXiv251008985v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Document reranking","a key component","information retrieval","initial retrieval results","ranking quality","downstream tasks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reasoning":2.0,"Document Ranking":2.0,"arXiv251008985v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Document reranking":1.0,"a key component":1.0,"information retrieval":1.0,"initial retrieval results":1.0,"ranking quality":1.0,"downstream tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763462118611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8504,"joy":0.0148,"surprise":0.079,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0128,"anger":0.0249,"disgust":0.0107},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in document reranking for information retrieval.

However, research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking. To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them. Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08987","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.645351","language":"en","tags":["csai","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Qixiang Yin, Huanjin Yao, Jianghao Chen, Jiaxing Huang, Zhicheng Zhao, Fei Su","raw_content_length":1676,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tiny-R1V","LIPO"],"persons":["Length-Informed"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1675,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008987v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Multimodal Large Language Models","MLLMs","remarkable capabilities","diverse tasks","numerous challenges","terms","reasoning efficiency","large model size"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008987v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multimodal Large Language Models":1.0,"MLLMs":1.0,"remarkable capabilities":1.0,"diverse tasks":1.0,"numerous challenges":1.0,"terms":1.0,"reasoning efficiency":1.0,"large model size":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7634935516666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.1355,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8271,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8743,"joy":0.0202,"surprise":0.0687,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0112,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel lightweight MLLM, Tiny-R1V, that aims to improve reasoning efficiency and accuracy using fewer tokens.

Existing reasoning approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint) pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity. Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search toward feasible and meaningful plans.

However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations, enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and (iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency.

To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08994","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.647715","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Yao Teng, Fuyun Wang, Xian Liu, Zhekai Chen, Han Shi, Yu Wang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Difan Zou, Xihui Liu","raw_content_length":1294,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SJD2"],"persons":["Jacobi","Gaussian","Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1293,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding","Accelerating Autoregressive Text","arXiv251008994v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a new paradigm","visual content generation","image","slow inference","their sequential token-by-token decoding process","thousands"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding":3.0,"Accelerating Autoregressive Text":2.0,"arXiv251008994v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a new paradigm":1.0,"visual content generation":1.0,"image":1.0,"slow inference":1.0,"their sequential token-by-token decoding process":1.0,"thousands":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7635849755555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8277,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0393,"sadness":0.0599,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0327,"disgust":0.0293},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a new method for accelerating autoregressive text-to-image models, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption by decreasing the computational resources needed for image generation.

It is a crucial technology that transforms wireless connections into ubiquitous sensors. ISAC unlocks transformative new capabilities, powering autonomous systems, augmented human sensing, and next-generation immersive applications, such as digital twins. However, this new reality fundamentally reshapes the security landscape. The primary security concern shifts from the traditional focus on data protection to a new priority: safeguarding the integrity of the system's perception of physical reality itself. This perception can be perilously manipulated by sophisticated attacks such as sensing eavesdropping, phantom dangers, and invisible threats, potentially resulting in direct and catastrophic physical harm.

These risks have spurred interest in LLM unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean, well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets. By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow lexical patterns.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09007","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.650701","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Changsheng Wang, Yihua Zhang, Dennis Wei, Jinghan Jia, Pin-Yu Chen, Sijia Liu","raw_content_length":1300,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","Watermarked Data arXiv:2510.09007v1 Announce Type","NPO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1299,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Noisy Forget Sets","A Study","Incomplete","Rewritten","Watermarked Data","arXiv251009007v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language models","LLMs","remarkable generative capabilities"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A Study"],"ai_ml":["Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Noisy Forget Sets":2.0,"A Study":2.0,"Incomplete":2.0,"Rewritten":2.0,"Watermarked Data":2.0,"arXiv251009007v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"remarkable generative capabilities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763694375833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7615,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2751,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0076,"sadness":0.0291,"fear":0.3795,"anger":0.1979,"disgust":0.1043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the robustness of LLM unlearning methods when dealing with noisy data.

However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09008","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.651132","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Hoigi Seo, Dong Un Kang, Hyunjin Cho, Joohoon Lee, Se Young Chun","raw_content_length":1439,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Epistemic Uncertainty of Visual Tokens for Object Hallucinations in Large Vision arXiv:2510.09008v1 Announce"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1438,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Epistemic Uncertainty","Visual Tokens","Object Hallucinations","Large Vision","LVLMs","object hallucination","arXiv251009008v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large vision-language models","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Epistemic Uncertainty"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Epistemic Uncertainty":2.0,"Visual Tokens":2.0,"Object Hallucinations":2.0,"Large Vision":2.0,"LVLMs":2.0,"object hallucination":2.0,"arXiv251009008v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large vision-language models":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763709884166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.119,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0155,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.8355,"anger":0.0083,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a method to mitigate object hallucination in large vision-language models by masking uncertain visual tokens.

Current quantization methods operate without considering hardware architecture, resulting in sub-optimal solutions within the vast design space encompassing accuracy, latency, and model size.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e6f0c1cb786f","title":"Value","content":"arXiv:2510.09017v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09017","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.654813","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Rui Bu, Haofeng Zhong, Wenzheng Chen, Yangyan Li","raw_content_length":1377,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Transformer","VGA","Value-State Gated Attention"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1376,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Value","arXiv251009017v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large models","the Transformer architecture","extreme-token phenomena","attention sinks","value-state drains","These issues","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["value-state drains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Value":2.0,"arXiv251009017v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large models":1.0,"the Transformer architecture":1.0,"extreme-token phenomena":1.0,"attention sinks":1.0,"value-state drains":1.0,"These issues":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763846552222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.75,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.25,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6934,"joy":0.0052,"surprise":0.0243,"sadness":0.0368,"fear":0.0213,"anger":0.0934,"disgust":0.1256},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new architectural mechanism (VGA) to improve the efficiency and stability of large language models.

We present Slim Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio, and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline, Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A 96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09018","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.655216","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Ian Harshbarger, Calvin Chidambaram","raw_content_length":1381,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PPO"],"persons":["Slim Scheduler"],"locations":["VRAM"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1380,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Slim Scheduler","A Runtime","arXiv251009018v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Most neural network scheduling research","end","fixed width","dynamic approaches","heterogeneous hardware","runtime conditions"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Most neural network scheduling research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Slim Scheduler":3.0,"A Runtime":2.0,"arXiv251009018v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Most neural network scheduling research":1.0,"end":1.0,"fixed width":1.0,"dynamic approaches":1.0,"heterogeneous hardware":1.0,"runtime conditions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763861138333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8603,"joy":0.0191,"surprise":0.0884,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel scheduling framework (Slim Scheduler) that reduces energy usage and latency for neural network inference.

It holds paramount significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most existing studies are constrained by the \\textbf{Pseudo De Novo}, \\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \\textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1) We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\\% and 11.7\\% over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09020","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.655655","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Zekai Chen, Xunkai Li, Sirui Zhang, Henan Sun, Jia Li, Zhenjun Li, Bing Zhou, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang","raw_content_length":1726,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MagicDock","Ligand Type","Docking Modeling"],"persons":["Toward Docking","De novo","Announce Type"],"locations":["De Novo"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1725,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MagicDock","Docking","arXiv251009020v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","De novo ligand design","a fundamental task","protein or molecule candidates","protein receptors","strong binding affinity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MagicDock":2.0,"Docking":2.0,"arXiv251009020v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"De novo ligand design":1.0,"a fundamental task":1.0,"protein or molecule candidates":1.0,"protein receptors":1.0,"strong binding affinity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763876205,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.9225,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7845,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.886,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0166,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0495,"anger":0.023,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel framework (MagicDock) for de novo ligand design, which could potentially accelerate the discovery of new drugs and materials with improved sustainability profiles.

Given this progress, we assess how well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process. We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows, and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Hardware, algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact shifting.

Current defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation process is flawed. Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass 12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally reported near-zero attack success rates.

However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs. In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall, demonstrating that \"LLMs don't really know what they don't know\".","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09033","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.659314","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Chi Seng Cheang, Hou Pong Chan, Wenxuan Zhang, Yang Deng","raw_content_length":1327,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1326,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Large Language Models","What","arXiv251009033v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent work","large language models","encode factuality signals","their internal representations","hidden states"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"What":2.0,"arXiv251009033v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent work":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"encode factuality signals":1.0,"their internal representations":1.0,"hidden states":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764013153333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9007,"joy":0.003,"surprise":0.0339,"sadness":0.0116,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0198,"disgust":0.0247},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the limitations of LLMs in discerning truthfulness, which has an indirect impact on sustainability.

In this article, we adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption. From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions, without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz bound assumptions.

To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

While extensive progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions. To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d18d396da742","title":"Repairing Regex Vulnerabilities via Localization","content":"arXiv:2510.09037v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however, are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR), designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern, creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment.

Prior GUI agents compress past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \\$4000 and fine-tune only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\\% parameters) with 1,500 samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts.

Conventional iterative detectors, such as the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and the traditional information geometry algorithm (IGA), suffer from a per iteration complexity that scales with the number of base station (BS) antennas, creating a computational bottleneck. To overcome this, CS-IGA introduces a novel cross matrix splitting of the natural parameter in the a posteriori distribution. This factorization allows the iterative detection based on the matched filter, which reduces per iteration computational complexity. Furthermore, we extend this framework to nonlinear detection and propose nonlinear CSIGA (NCS-IGA) by seamlessly embedding discrete constellation constraints, enabling symbol-wise processing without external interference cancellation loops. Comprehensive simulations under realistic channel conditions demonstrate that CS-IGA matches or surpasses the bit error rate (BER) performance of Bayes optimal AMP and IGA for both linear and nonlinear detection, while achieving this with fewer iterations and a substantially lower computational cost. These results establish CS-IGA as a practical and powerful solution for high-throughput signal detection in next generation XL-MIMO systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09039","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.661796","language":"en","tags":["research","mathit","preprints","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Wenjun Zhang, An-An Lu, Xiqi Gao","raw_content_length":1483,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CSIGA","IGA","CS-IGA","AMP","XL arXiv:2510.09039v1 Announce Type","NCS-IGA"],"persons":["antennas"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1482,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Low Complexity Detector","arXiv251009039v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","this paper","the cross","based information geometry approach","CS-IGA","uplink signal recovery","extralarge-scale MIMO XL-MIMO systems","Conventional iterative detectors"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Low Complexity Detector":2.0,"arXiv251009039v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"the cross":1.0,"based information geometry approach":1.0,"CS-IGA":1.0,"uplink signal recovery":1.0,"extralarge-scale MIMO XL-MIMO systems":1.0,"Conventional iterative detectors":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764106209444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8442,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0171,"sadness":0.0219,"fear":0.0295,"anger":0.0222,"disgust":0.0542},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel algorithm (CS-IGA) for signal detection in XL-MIMO systems, which could reduce computational complexity and energy consumption compared to existing methods.

However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09041","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.662209","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Junchao Fan, Xiaolin Chang","raw_content_length":1800,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Intelligent General","Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning","DRL"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1799,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robust Driving Control","Autonomous Vehicles","An Intelligent General","Announce Type","new Abstract","DRL","remarkable success","autonomous driving policies","its vulnerability","adversarial attacks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robust Driving Control":2.0,"Autonomous Vehicles":2.0,"An Intelligent General":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"DRL":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"autonomous driving policies":1.0,"its vulnerability":1.0,"adversarial attacks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764121336111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.545,"joy":0.0103,"surprise":0.0305,"sadness":0.1828,"fear":0.166,"anger":0.0405,"disgust":0.0249},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach (IGCARL) to improve the robustness of autonomous driving systems against adversarial attacks, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by increasing the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant advancements across various domains including translation and summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore, proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09043","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.665072","language":"en","tags":["csai","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Sang Hun Kim, Jongmin Lee, Dongkyu Park, So Young Lee, Yosep Chong","raw_content_length":1849,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MBTI","Large Language Models","Humanoid Artificial Consciousness Designed"],"persons":["Language Model Based"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1848,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Humanoid Artificial Consciousness","Large Language Model","Psychoanalysis and Personality Theory","arXiv251009043v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Human consciousness","a concept","current scientific understanding","Large Language Models","LLMs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Model","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Humanoid Artificial Consciousness":2.0,"Large Language Model":2.0,"Psychoanalysis and Personality Theory":2.0,"arXiv251009043v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Human consciousness":1.0,"a concept":1.0,"current scientific understanding":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7641504452777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.892,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0579,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.013,"anger":0.0128,"disgust":0.0123},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to AI consciousness using psychoanalysis and personality theory.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3867f30d954e","title":"MEC$^3$O: Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.09049v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0ba9fe2cc5d9","title":"Alif: Advancing Urdu Large Language Models via Multilingual Synthetic Data Distillation","content":"arXiv:2510.09051v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset (Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool, this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning, bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct approach.

To address this, this paper proposes a cooperative radio-frequency (RF) detection and localization framework that leverages existing cellular base stations. The proposed approach features a robust scheme for LSS target identification, integrating a cell averaging-constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector with a micro-Doppler signature (MDS) based recognition method. Multi-station measurements are fused through a grid-based probabilistic algorithm combined with clustering techniques, effectively mitigating ghost targets and improving localization accuracy in multi-UAV scenarios. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived as a performance benchmark and reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization is employed to balance localization accuracy against station resource usage. Simulations demonstrate that increasing from one to multiple BSs reduces the positioning error to near the CRLB, while practical experiments further verify the framework's effectiveness. Furthermore, our RL-based optimization can find solutions that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource usage, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for ensuring airspace safety in the emerging low-altitude economy.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09055","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.667823","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","eesssy","cssy","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Tianhao Liang, Mu Jia, Tingting Zhang, Junting Chen, Longyu Zhou, Tony Q.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a1cbc1328c26","title":"Lesion","content":"arXiv:2510.09056v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817 patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models. Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09056","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.668262","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Junhyeok Lee, Hyunwoong Kim, Hyungjin Chung, Heeseong Eom, Joon Jang, Chul-Ho Sohn, Kyu Sung Choi","raw_content_length":1839,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1838,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Lesion","arXiv251009056v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Image","various challenges","medical image acquisition","Latent diffusion models","LDMs","leverage efficient learning","compressed latent space"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["medical image acquisition"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Lesion":2.0,"arXiv251009056v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Image":1.0,"various challenges":1.0,"medical image acquisition":1.0,"Latent diffusion models":1.0,"LDMs":1.0,"leverage efficient learning":1.0,"compressed latent space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7642579425,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.7735,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5547,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8168,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.01,"sadness":0.0115,"fear":0.0933,"anger":0.0364,"disgust":0.0227},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel post-training framework for latent diffusion models to improve medical image translation, specifically focusing on lesion delineation.

We present a training-free, inference-time control mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation. Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints, approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained.

In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages synthetic speech data generated by a high-quality, pretrained multispeaker text-to-speech (TTS) model.

We argue that usable reasoning systems must be trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales (1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.

To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point, respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific scene.

During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring accurate sample generation. Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques. A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection (CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points, combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09079","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.673023","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Emilio Mastriani, Alessandro Costa, Federico Incardona, Kevin Munari, Sebastiano Spinello","raw_content_length":1385,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ChangeFinder","Improving Anomaly Detection","CPD","Change Point Detection"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["0.8599"]},"char_count":1384,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Anomaly Detection","Industrial Time Series","The Role","Segmentation","Heterogeneous Ensemble","Announce Type","new Abstract","machine learning","segmentation models","state changes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["machine learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Anomaly Detection":2.0,"Industrial Time Series":2.0,"The Role":2.0,"Segmentation":2.0,"Heterogeneous Ensemble":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"machine learning":1.0,"segmentation models":1.0,"state changes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7644256633333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.464,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8928,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9256,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0328,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0095,"anger":0.0104,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes research improving anomaly detection in industrial time series, potentially leading to more efficient industrial processes and reduced waste.

When a robot fails repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users. The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for classifying successive failures.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_53202e963175","title":"Physics-Informed High","content":"arXiv:2510.09082v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.674247","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","csai","research","preprints","cscy","cssi","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Bicheng Wang, Jinping Wang, Yibo Sue","raw_content_length":1881,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1880,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Physics-Informed High","complex networks","arXiv251009082v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Learning complex network dynamics","understanding","real-world complex systems","two main problems","the task","the dynamic evolution"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["two main problems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Physics-Informed High":2.0,"complex networks":2.0,"arXiv251009082v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Learning complex network dynamics":1.0,"understanding":1.0,"real-world complex systems":1.0,"two main problems":1.0,"the task":1.0,"the dynamic evolution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7644709597222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.158,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8316,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9108,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0131,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0264,"anger":0.022,"disgust":0.016},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a method for improving the accuracy and interpretability of predicting complex network dynamics.
