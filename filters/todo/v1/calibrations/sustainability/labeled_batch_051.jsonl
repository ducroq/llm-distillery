In a cell, the MG state has functional significance compared to the native or unfolded states owing to its enhanced side-chain dynamics. In this study, we re-examined the acid-denatured state of the metalloprotein azurin and also investigated whether circular permutation (CP) of azurin can lead to modulation of the energy landscape to yield intermediate or MG states. CP is a protein engineering tool that allows the rearrangement of the secondary structural elements without perturbing the overall three-dimensional protein structure. We carried out comprehensive thermal, chemical, and pH denaturation studies to examine possible MG states in azurin WT. We additionally examined two CPs of azurin, whose energy landscapes in the metal-free and metal-bound forms have been previously characterized. One of the positions of CP is near the metal-binding loop (cpN42) and the other is within the active site of the protein (cpF114). We used thermal denaturation monitored by far-UV and near-UV CD, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of a buried Trp, and solvent accessibility of the same Trp residue to evaluate the presence of MG states in these proteins. WT azurin shows binding with ANS at a low pH due to ionic interaction with the fluorophore at this pH. We find that though WT azurin does not adopt an MG state, CP of azurin(s) exhibited an MG state. Our findings highlight the potential of CP to modulate protein energy landscapes and consequently the physiological functions of proteins.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681544v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.350797","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Das, D., Ainavarapu, S.

These dynamic assemblies often contain several components such as proteins and RNAs. Experimental methods to study biological condensates commonly involve fluorophore-labelling of the biomolecules, which may affect phase separation behavior and in addition cannot access dilute-phase components due to low dye concentrations. Here we introduce a non-invasive, multiplexed NMR approach that enables selective observation of multiple components in hydrogel-stabilized biphasic condensates without using tags. The introduced multiplexing filter combines enhanced spin-spin cross-relaxation in the condensed phase with diffusion and isotope filters to resolve signals from distinct protein pools from both dilute and condensed phases. We demonstrate the robust performance of this 1D 1H NMR experiment using biphasic samples containing condensates of FUS N-terminal domain, FUS full-length, and the multicomponent condensate formed by two intrinsically disordered regions of hnRNPC1 protein with highly overlapping resonances. Integrating the multiplexing filter into multidimensional experiments enables site-specific structural and dynamic insights from diverse protein populations, extending NMR applications in LLPS.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681607v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.351086","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Palfy, G., Schmoll, J., Perez, M.

Prior benchmarks of avidity sequencing have not included the latest Illumina NovaSeq X/X Plus instruments with XLEAP chemistry. Here, we have run PCR-free whole genome sequencing on four human tumor cell lines using both Illumina NovaSeq X Plus and Element AVITI instruments. AVITI showed low duplication rates and reported higher base qualities, the latter contributed to improved mapping confidence and fewer spurious variant candidates. Both platforms were found to be highly comparable when benchmarking variant calling, with AVITI only providing a minor improvement on INDELs at lower coverages. Stratifying by genomic context revealed further differences, where AVITI genome coverage and variant calls were superior in high GC regions while being inferior in GC homopolymers. Error rate analysis highlighted further differences between the platforms, in particular AVITI in some instances displayed an increased error rate on read 2 related to short fragments. AVITI error rate was also found to be more stable downstream of repetitive regions, except for GC homopolymers. We further found that AVITI sequencing was sensitive to G-quadruplex motifs.

Using an insect model of traumatic brain injury, we examined variation in the risk of mortality using quantitative genetic approaches applied previously for life history traits in Drosophila melanogaster. We quantified additive genetic variance for mortality risk using a controlled breeding design and found levels of variation consistent with existing data on major fitness components. We found no evidence for inbreeding effects on mortality risk, suggesting that dominance genetic variance makes little contribution to this trait. To explain the high level of standing genetic variation, we considered whether mortality risk depends on the metabolic resources available to an individual, also known as \"condition\". We manipulated condition by inducing random mutations and by restricting calories during larval development. We found that reduced condition due to both random mutations and resource limitation significantly increased the risk of mortality following trauma. Among inbred lines, greater mortality risk was associated with lower viability, fecundity and longevity, consistent with an effect of genome-wide genetic quality. Our results suggest that further consideration of individual condition would be valuable for understanding and predicting variation in the outcomes of traumatic brain injury.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681457v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.352034","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Yun, G., Liu, R., Sharp, N.

Vector control operators, public health officers, and communities look for weather-based decision support systems to inform mosquito management policies. Despite an increasing number of entomological and modelling studies, our incomplete understanding of mosquito population response to weather drivers in natural conditions restricts the development of sound vector management policies. Here, we aim to clarify the role of weather conditions on Ae. albopictus presence and abundance in four sites in southwestern France. We rely on ovitrap longitudinal records collected on a 1-2 weeks basis and weather time series over 2023 and 2024 to model oviposition activity. Our analysis combines a mechanistic model from literature and a new machine learning model fitted on cross-correlated lagged weather predictors. Both models satisfactorily reproduce the observed oviposition dynamics, correctly predicting the onset and the end of the activity - periods that existing models have often inadequately captured. Temperature plays a major role in triggering the presence of Ae. albopictus, explaining the interannual variation of oviposition in all sites, especially in spring and autumn. In fact, warm springs and autumns extend the periods in which Ae. albopictus life-history traits (fertility, development, survival) approach their thermal optima. In summer, a more prominent role of rain and humidity emerges among secondary drivers of oviposition intensity. This work contributes to the development of operational weather-driven forecasting tools for Ae. albopictus activity to support vector control operations in different biogeographical contexts.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681559v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.352368","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Taconet, P., Radici, A., Lacour, G., Mignotte, A., Hammami, P., Fontenille, D.","raw_content_length":1765,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ovitrap longitudinal"],"persons":[],"locations":["France","Europe"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1765,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Temperature","the key weather","Aedes","albopictus seasonal activity","southern France","The presence","the activity","Aedes albopictus","a growing concern","nuisance"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Temperature":2.0,"the key weather":2.0,"Aedes":2.0,"albopictus seasonal activity":2.0,"southern France":2.0,"The presence":1.0,"the activity":1.0,"Aedes albopictus":1.0,"a growing concern":1.0,"nuisance":1.0}},"age_hours":30.677142218611113,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6160000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5232,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3147,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0058,"sadness":0.029,"fear":0.5631,"anger":0.0446,"disgust":0.0395},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research develops a weather-driven forecasting tool for Aedes albopictus activity, using ovitrap data and weather time series from 2023 and 2024.

We standardised this data in a simple manner (i.e., species by relative abundance and site frequency) to examine if there were any stark changes over this time span. Though we recognise some limitations in our comparisons (i.e., spatial variation in sites and methods), the data indicated that the mammal fauna had generally not changed substantially in composition, relative abundance or frequency across sites. However, some species symptomatic of small mammal decline elsewhere (i.e., Rattus tunneyi) may have become less common, whereas other species were recorded for the first time in more recent years (2010-2017), particularly by camera traps (i.e., Trichosurus vulpecula, Isoodon macrourus, Melomys burtoni). We postulate that change in the mammal fauna on the semi-arid fringe of tropical savannas may have occurred prior to the 1980s, with a long history of cattle grazing likely a contributing factor.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ae04835dd062","title":"Predicting the cross","content":"Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a major threat to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where cassava is a staple crop. Caused by cassava brown streak ipomoviruses (CBSIs), CBSD has spread extensively since its detection in Uganda in 2004, raising concerns about ongoing spread through Southern and Central Africa and potential expansion to West Africa, home to the world's largest cassava producer, Nigeria. Building on a stochastic epidemiological model that predicts CBSD spread at the scale of Uganda, we incorporate extensive field surveillance records to extend the model to all thirty-two major cassava-producing countries in SSA. We then deploy the model to address key strategic questions such as estimating the present day CBSD distribution and predicting rates of ongoing spread towards West Africa. We also evaluate the risk of direct introductions resulting from long range movement of infected planting material, which could trigger outbreaks beyond predicted localised dispersal limits. Our model predicts the likely arrival of CBSD in Nigeria via cross-continental spread within 25 years, and if directly introduced anywhere in West Africa, spreading to most West African nations within 10 years. The risks of ongoing and future CBSD spread highlighted in this study underscore the need for proactive phytosanitation measures, including clean seed programs, vector control, and quarantine policies to curb CBSD spread. Moreover, the model described in this study not only provides estimates for arrival times across SSA, but also lays the foundations for a continental-scale quantitative framework wherein both surveillance and management options can be explored and optimised.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681618v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.352958","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Godding, D., Stutt, R.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_9a90ff4ad8e9","title":"Combining FRET and super","content":"Protein kinases are key regulators of intracellular signaling, showing activities in specific subcellular compartments and in micro- or nano-domains. Genetically encoded biosensors based on Forster's Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) are powerful tools to track kinase dynamics. Yet, they are typically limited by spatial resolution and remain challenging to implement with super-resolution microscopy approaches that require specific fluorophores or optical setups. Aurora kinase A (AURKA), a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, has recently emerged as a critical regulator of mitochondrial physiology. However, visualising AURKA activation and activity in living cells with sub-diffraction precision remains a challenge. Here, we introduce BioSenSRRF, a versatile approach that combines conventional FRET biosensors with Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations (SRRF) microscopy. BioSenSRRF requires no modification of existing probes, can be implemented using standard microscopy setups, and is supported by a publicly available ImageJ framework to streamline image processing and data analysis. Using this pipeline, we imaged AURKA activation at mitochondria and its activity in regulating mitochondrial ATP levels. We uncover that AURKA activation and activity are compartmentalised into distinct mitochondrial domains containing the mitochondrial ATP synthase. These subdomains depend on the catalytic activity of AURKA, and they can be altered using previously validated AURKA inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that the cancer-associated polymorphism F31I enhances AURKA activation and ATP production on ATP synthase-enriched subdomains, underscoring its pathological relevance. Altogether, BioSenSRRF provides a broadly accessible framework to enhance the spatial resolution of genetically encoded biosensors. This strategy opens new avenues for dissecting the subcellular organisation of protein complexes and their contribution to physiology and disease states.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681576v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.353514","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Jolivet, N.

These effects are widely believed to result in the acetylation of distinct histones that regulate specific genes, including at transcription starting sites (TSS) and enhancers. However, we show that this is not the case, as butyrate dose-dependently increases the acetylation of histones throughout the entire genome. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the RING-loop prevents the recruitment of p300 to acetylated histones through its bromodomain, and thereby cannot maintain the acetylation of specific histones through positive feedback. This was confirmed by showing that only catalytically inactive p300 stably binds to acetylated histones. Thus, the epigenetic regulation of specific genes by butyrate is limited, but butyrate instead increases histone acetylation globally resulting in opening of the entire chromatin structure.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681627v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.353868","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Jiang, M., Psoma, A., Lyu, J., Chiariello, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_faa6e28a610d","title":"Transposon targeting non","content":"Tetrahymena is a well-established ciliate model organism, known for its nuclear dualism and unique mechanism for transposon defense, wherein transposons are kept within the highly heterochromatinized micronucleus (MIC), which is transcriptionally inert except during meiosis. The discovery of preferential transcription in the meiotic MIC at regions enriched with transposons, and the identification of MIC transcription regulatory proteins, emphasizes the necessity to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving this process. In this study, we demonstrate that G/C-rich tracts are overrepresented in meiotic non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcription regions and that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is highly enriched at and around these tracts. Further analysis revealed that Pol II's association with G/C-rich tracts is not abolished in cells lacking Rib1, a Mediator complex-associated protein essential for MIC ncRNA biogenesis. Nevertheless, in the absence of Rib1, Pol II showed abnormal association with the meiotic MIC chromatin, suggesting that Rib1 is critical for maintaining Pol II's binding specificity. Through Rib1 truncation analysis, we found that the intrinsically disordered region, which contains putative phase-separating peptides, is crucial for its function. Disruption of phase-separation, either by deleting these peptides or by treating cells with a phase-separation disruption reagent, leads to aberrant localization of both Rib1 and Pol II on the MIC chromatin, implicating that Rib1 likely facilitates the MIC ncRNA transcription via phase-separation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681302v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.354432","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Cai, X., Liu, Y. k., Li, J. l., Zhao, Z. r., Yao, X. y., Zhai, Z. h., Liucong, M. m., Liu, Y. j., Wang, X., Mochizuki, K., Tian, M.","raw_content_length":1572,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MIC","Rib1","G/C-rich","Transposon"],"persons":["Pol II","Pol II's"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1572,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Transposon","non","transposons","Tetrahymena","a well-established ciliate model organism","its nuclear dualism","unique mechanism","transposon defense","the highly heterochromatinized micronucleus","MIC"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["MIC"],"research_academic":["MIC"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Transposon":2.0,"non":2.0,"transposons":2.0,"Tetrahymena":1.0,"a well-established ciliate model organism":1.0,"its nuclear dualism":1.0,"unique mechanism":1.0,"transposon defense":1.0,"the highly heterochromatinized micronucleus":1.0,"MIC":1.0}},"age_hours":30.67724850027778,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8879,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0129,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.009,"anger":0.0215,"disgust":0.0526},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes basic research into transposon defense mechanisms in Tetrahymena.

Recognising liver disease stages and elucidating the molecular underpinning of their progression are thus medically important. Methods Using data gathered from 300 patients with obesity of the ABOS cohort, we selected non-redundant clinical variables, gene expressions and CpGs methylation levels most associated with severity using unsupervised approaches to train a multi-module, multi-layer perceptron predicting patients liver status. Results The combination of five models trained on the three modalities reached an AUC of 0.945 on a validation set, with accuracies above 81% for simple steatosis and 88% for NASH, outperforming other machine learning models so far. The latent space of our clinical data module retrieved patient clusters identified previously, but not the gene expression and DNA methylation ones. While all three modules are needed to reach the best prediction accuracy in all classes, the gene expression module impacted the decision the most. Independently trained models put more weights on the same genes, underlying their importance. Impactful genes were linked to immune responses and extracellular matrix. Many of those genes were previously unassociated with MASLD onset or progression. Conclusions A multi-omics deep-learning model can recognise steatohepatitis from simple liver steatosis with an AUC of 0.945 and identify new genes potentially involved in NAFLD progression. Gene expressions profiles predicting disease severity are largely different from those specific of clinical variable clusters. Impact and implications: This study suggests that clinical variables are not sufficient to recognise the severity of steatotic liver disease with high accuracy, but model efficiency increases when used together with liver epigenetics and transcriptomics.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681581v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.354743","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Gambardella, N., Fettem, S., Boissel, M., Ning, L., Raverdy, V., Afnouch, M., Amanzougarene, S., Derhourhi, M., Toussaint, B., Vaillant, E., Khamis, A., Lefebvre, P., Staels, B., Pattou, F., Froguel, P., Bonnefond, A.","raw_content_length":1964,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NASH","ABOS","Background & Aims Metabolic","CpGs"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1964,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Deep learning models","clinical data","liver omics","NASH","steatosis","new genes","liver disease severity","obesity","MASLD","a frequent co"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Deep learning models":2.0,"clinical data":2.0,"liver omics":2.0,"NASH":2.0,"steatosis":2.0,"new genes":2.0,"liver disease severity":2.0,"obesity":2.0,"MASLD":1.0,"a frequent co":1.0}},"age_hours":30.67726386888889,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.633,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.027,"sadness":0.117,"fear":0.1405,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.0587},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on a deep learning model that can distinguish between liver disease stages with high accuracy (AUC of 0.945).

Though these fungal phytopathogens have been found to frequently cohabitate the same leaf, their interaction dynamics in the manifestation of disease remain poorly understood due to limitations in species-specific detection methods. We developed a digital PCR based model targeting conserved regions of the -tubulin gene, enabling biomass quantification of both pathogens during infection. Field surveys revealed up to two in three symptomatic infections involved both pathogens, with co-infected plants showing significantly higher individual pathogen biomass than single-species infections. Host plants in the field with moderate resistance to both pathogens were found to be significantly more necrotic under co-infection, with individual pathogen biomass up to twice that observed value for single infections. However, like fair-weather friends the partnership between these two pathogens seems to be conditional. When P. tritici-repentis established first, secondary P. nodorum colonisation led to a breakdown of host resistance. Conversely, when P. nodorum established on the host first, it suppressed P. tritici-repentis colonisation regardless of host resistance. To our knowledge this is the first description of asymmetric priority effects overcoming host resistance in a plant pathosystem.

Here, we uncover a highly conserved, co-located biosynthetic megacluster in Streptomyces, a striking \"cluster of clusters\", that encodes four distinct natural product families: acidomycin, stravidins, dapamycins, and -methyl-KAPA, and is flanked by genes that encode streptavidin, a high-affinity biotin-binding protein. Remarkably, all molecules target different steps in bacterial biotin metabolism, revealing a multi-pronged natural strategy for biotin starvation. This arrangement of four functionally convergent biosynthetic gene clusters at a single genomic locus is without precedent. Even more surprisingly, we find that this anti-biotin megacluster is widespread across Streptomyces bacteria, suggesting a deeply conserved evolutionary solution to microbial competition. Mechanistically, the compounds inhibit biotin biosynthesis through enzyme blockade, prodrug activation, covalent cofactor mimicry, and biotin sequestration via co-expressed streptavidin. Stravidin S2 and -methyl-KAPA are effective in a murine model of multidrug-resistant E. coli infection. These findings expose a coordinated biosynthetic logic in microbial secondary metabolites and point to higher-order biosynthetic architectures as promising reservoirs of antibiotic innovation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681295v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.355320","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Gordzevich, R., Xu, M., Wang, W., Cook, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_169ae72f81c7","title":"Scalable transcription factor mapping uncovers the regulatory dynamics of natural and synthetic transcription factors in human T cell states","content":"Heterogeneous T cell states are critical in immune responses and have been explored by CRISPR-based and synthetic domain-swapped transcription factor (TF) screens, yielding novel insights and immunotherapeutics. However, a scalable strategy to map TFs in primary human T cells is lacking, which limits our understanding of the functions of critical TFs. We therefore adapted a transposon-based TF mapping strategy termed Calling Cards for primary human CD8 T cells, applying it to five key TFs with undefined binding sites in this cell type: TOX, TOX2, TCF7, SOX4, and RBPJ. To derive biological insights from these data, we developed an analytical framework to integrate TF binding with multi-omic sequencing data, revealing convergence of TOX and TCF7 binding at dynamic enhancers of memory CD8 T cells. We then identified TF co-bound gene programs related to memory and exhaustion states in addition to putative gene targets of known and unappreciated TF roles, including TOX binding at critical genes of both exhaustion and terminal effector memory differentiation. To further scale our TF analysis platform, we modified Calling Cards to create TFlex: a method uniquely suited for multiplexed mapping of paralogous TFs. We applied TFlex to simultaneously map eight natural and domain-swapped TFs in primary human CD8 T cells, which demonstrated that domain-swapped TFs display emergent behavior in binding site selection and transcriptional effects on target genes that cannot be estimated as the sum of their constituent domains. Collectively, our data highlight the importance of scalable TF mapping in primary human T cells to elucidate TF function and the transcriptional regulation of cell states.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681414v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:36:46.355612","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Mullins, R.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c1aeec3c4c81","title":"Militaire parade voor 80 jaar Noord","content":"Met een militaire parade, \"grootse massa-gymnastiek\" en optredens heeft Noord-Korea stilgestaan bij het tachtigjarig bestaan van de regerende Arbeiderspartij. Leider Kim Jong-un pakte ondanks de regen in de hoofdstad Pyongyang flink uit. De parade bevatte ouderwets machtsvertoon, maar ook met de genodigden wilde het land een boodschap overbrengen. Tienduizenden militairen van allerlei divisies marcheerden gisteravond over het Kim Il-sung plein in Pyongyang. Ook werden nieuwe wapens, waaronder raketten en tanks, getoond voor een (verplicht) klappend en juichend publiek. Met hoge vertegenwoordigers uit China, Rusland en Vietnam aan zijn zij, is Kims propagandaboodschap duidelijk: Noord-Korea is uit het internationale verdomhoekje en met ons gaat het beter dan ooit. Toch kwam de speech van Kim niet zo agressief tegen buitenlandse landen over als in eerdere jaren. Ook leek de schaal van de militaire parade wat kleiner. De sancties, de coronapandemie en de daaruit volgende economische malaise hebben hun sporen achtergelaten, ondanks de hernieuwde banden en handel met Rusland. Nieuw wapentuig Het Noord-Koreaanse regime liet voor het eerst de nieuwe intercontinentale ballistische raket Hwasong-20 (planeet Mars) zien. Die kan duizenden kilometers afleggen om aan de andere kant van de wereld doelen te raken. Ook werden er nieuwe soorten lanceerinstallaties getoond en technologie die de baan van raketten onberekenbaarder zou moeten maken. Een deel van de nieuwe wapens en installaties is nooit getest, dus er kan niet met zekerheid worden gesproken over de kwaliteit. De Noord-Koreaanse staatsmedia refereerden naar de Hwasong-20 als 's lands \"krachtigste nucleaire strategische wapensysteem\". Eerdere types van de Hwasong-raket konden ook al heel ver komen. Maar deze zou meerdere kernkoppen kunnen dragen en dus meerdere doelen tegelijkertijd kunnen aanvallen. Bij de parade was geen luchtshow met vliegtuigen, zoals in eerdere jaren wel het geval was. Wel werden nieuwe drones getoond waar Noord-Korea al enkele jaren hard in aan het investeren is. De parade leek minder groot dan eerder. Joost Oliemans, die een boek schreef over het Noord-Koreaanse leger, analyseerde voor NK News (een Zuid-Koreaans nieuwsmedium) dat \"de ambitie voor deze parade toch wat ingetogener leek dan voorgaande parades\". Poetin als 'dierbaarste kameraad' Opvallend was een formatie van Noord-Koreaanse soldaten die het afgelopen jaar voor Rusland tegen Oekraïne hebben gevochten. Oud-president Dmitri Medvedev was de hoogste Russische afgevaardigde. Die reageerde enthousiast bij het zien van de formatie. Economisch levert de hernieuwde band met Rusland Noord-Korea veel op. De Zuid-Koreaanse Centrale Bank schat dat de Noord-Koreaanse economie in 2024 met bijna 4 procent is gegroeid. Die groei zit vooral in productie, de bouw en de mijnbouw en natuurlijk de defensie-industrie. Kim noemde Poetin deze dagen zijn \"dierbaarste kameraad\" en wenste het Russisch leiderschap \"succes in het verdedigen van (...) de territoriale integriteit en het bouwen van een machtig Rusland\". Toen de eerste berichten naar buiten kwamen over Noord-Koreaanse soldaten aan het front in Oekraïne, bleef het stil in Pyongyang. Kim erkende pas in april dat hij soldaten naar het Russische font had gestuurd en hield in augustus herdenkingen voor de gevallen soldaten. Sancties Tegen Noord-Korea zijn zware sancties van de VN-Veiligheidsraad van kracht, vanwege het nucleaire programma. In 2017 stemden China en Rusland allebei nog voor verzwaring van de sancties. Maar met beide landen lijkt de relatie op te warmen, hoewel de sancties nog van kracht zijn. De handel die er officieel wel gedreven wordt is voor 90 procent met China. Maar in de coronapandemie sloot Noord-Korea zich af van de wereld en heerste er hongersnood en grootschalige ondervoeding. Nu is die handel weer opgestart, zij het nog lang niet op het niveau van voor de pandemie. Vorige maand stond Kim Jong-un nog op het podium met Chinese leider Xi Jinping tijdens de militaire parade in Peking, waar toen het 75-jarig bestaan van de Volksrepubliek werd gevierd. Nu stond China's nummer twee, premier Li Qiang, naast Kim Jong-un. Allebei grote multilaterale evenementen waar Noord-Korea zij aan zij met wereldleiders staat. Hoewel het uniek is voor Noord-Korea hoeveel buitenlandse gasten van hoog niveau ze ontvangen voor deze militaire parade, is het, samen met flink wat afgevaardigden van de communistische partijen van andere landen, nog steeds maar een klein percentage van het totale aantal landen wereldwijd.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586071","published_date":"2025-10-11T11:48:28","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:44:31.577612","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":682,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4915,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.41,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Kim"],"locations":["Rusland","Noord-Korea","Arbeiderspartij","China","Pyongyang"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4561,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Militaire parade","jaar","een militaire parade","grootse massa-gymnastiek","optredens","de regerende Arbeiderspartij","Leider","Jong-un","de regen","de hoofdstad"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Militaire parade"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Militaire parade":2.0,"jaar":2.0,"een militaire parade":1.0,"grootse massa-gymnastiek":1.0,"optredens":1.0,"de regerende Arbeiderspartij":1.0,"Leider":1.0,"Jong-un":1.0,"de regen":1.0,"de hoofdstad":1.0}},"age_hours":1.0345471372222221,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7698,"joy":0.0314,"surprise":0.079,"sadness":0.0256,"fear":0.0224,"anger":0.0379,"disgust":0.0339},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"transition_delay","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article primarily discusses a military parade showcasing new weaponry, including intercontinental ballistic missiles.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_bf63b6690daa","title":"Britse vliegtuigen patrouilleerden 12 uur nabij de Russische grens","content":"Twee vliegtuigen van de Royal Air Force hebben eerder deze week een missie van twaalf uur uitgevoerd, samen met andere NAVO-bondgenoten. De missie was bedoeld om te patrouilleren langs de Russische grens. \"Dit was een omvangrijke gezamenlijke missie met onze Amerikaanse en NAVO-bondgenoten\", meldt de Britse minister van Defensie Healey vandaag. \"Dit levert niet alleen waardevolle informatie op om het operationele bewustzijn van onze strijdkrachten te vergroten, maar het stuurt ook een krachtig signaal van NAVO-eenheid naar Poetin en onze tegenstanders\", zegt hij. Een elektronisch surveillancevliegtuig RC-135 Rivet Joint en een P-8A Poseidon patrouillevliegtuig vlogen donderdag vanuit het Noordpoolgebied langs Belarus en Oekraïne, ondersteund door een KC-135 tankvliegtuig van de Amerikaanse luchtmacht. Eastern Sentry De NAVO-missie houdt volgens Healey verband met een reeks recente invallen binnen het NAVO-luchtruim door Russische drones en vliegtuigen. Zo schond Rusland meermaals het luchtruim van Estland op 19 september. Toen het voor de vierde keer gebeurde riep Estland artikel 4 in. De NAVO-landen hebben de Russische schending toen scherp veroordeeld. Rusland wordt volledig verantwoordelijk gehouden voor de actie en de NAVO waarschuwt dat het antwoord stevig zal zijn. \"De NAVO zal zijn capaciteit uitbreiden en zijn verdediging versterken, onder meer met doeltreffende luchtverdediging\", verklaarde de NAVO-landen toen. Eerder deze maand kondigde het militair bondgenootschap aan de oostflank van de NAVO-alliantie verder te versterken. Dat gebeurt op de grond en in de lucht. De operatie, Eastern Sentry genoemd, heeft speciale aandacht voor het onderscheppen van drones. Waakzaamheid Vandaag maakt het Nederlandse ministerie van Defensie bekend dat de marine een gehavende Russische onderzeeër door de Noordzee begeleid heeft. Een marineschip hield de Novorossiejsk en een ondersteunende sleepboot in de gaten tot ze de Nederlandse wateren weer verlieten. De onderzeeër had een brandstoflek en vaart daarom aan de oppervlakte. Voor de Nederlandse marine hield de Britse marine toezicht in het Engelse Kanaal. De Britten droegen dat in het Nederlandse deel van de Noordzee over aan de Nederlandse Zr.Ms. Luymes. \"Hoewel voor de Exclusief Economische Zone een internationaal recht van doorvaart geldt, escorteert Nederland alle Russische marineschepen. Nederland toont zo waakzaamheid en voorkomt dat Russische schepen onderzeese infrastructuur saboteren\", aldus het ministerie van Defensie.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586070","published_date":"2025-10-11T11:47:13","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:44:31.578648","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":355,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3043,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Rivet Joint","Royal Air Force"],"persons":["Healey"],"locations":["Poetin","Poseidon","Oekraïne"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2515,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["uur","de Russische grens","Britse vliegtuigen","Dit","vliegtuigen","eerder deze week","een missie","andere NAVO-bondgenoten","De missie","NAVO-bondgenoten"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"uur":3.0,"de Russische grens":3.0,"Britse vliegtuigen":2.0,"Dit":2.0,"vliegtuigen":1.0,"eerder deze week":1.0,"een missie":1.0,"andere NAVO-bondgenoten":1.0,"De missie":1.0,"NAVO-bondgenoten":1.0}},"age_hours":1.0553956516666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7749,"joy":0.0133,"surprise":0.0814,"sadness":0.0392,"fear":0.0296,"anger":0.0289,"disgust":0.0328},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes military actions (aircraft patrols and submarine monitoring) in response to geopolitical tensions.

Ook krijgt de man een werkstraf van 100 uur en moet hij het slachtoffer een schadevergoeding van 1600 euro betalen. De man randde het meisje aan tijdens rijlessen in Urk, in april en mei vorig jaar. Hij raakte haar bovenbenen, buik en borsten aan. Ook moest ze tegen wil en dank verregaande 'sekspraatjes' van hem aanhoren, schrijft Omroep Flevoland. Het meisje maakte stiekem geluidsopnames, waarin de rijinstructeur in geuren en kleuren beschreef wat hij met het meisje wilde doen. Ook gaf hij aan welk genot de leerling eraan zou beleven. Met de opnames stapte ze naar de politie. Schaamte De instructeur zei schaamte te voelen voor de seksuele gesprekken die hij met de leerling had, maar hij ontkende haar te hebben aangeraakt. Toch stelde de rechter geen reden te hebben om te twijfelen aan de verklaringen van het slachtoffer. De verklaringen zijn consistent, gedetailleerd en concreet, luidt het oordeel van de rechtbank. Bovendien ondersteunen de opnamen in de lesauto de aangifte van het meisje. Beroepsverbod De rechter legt een beroepsverbod op van twee jaar, een jaar minder dan het OM had geëist. De instructeur had in het najaar van 2023 al een waarschuwingsgesprek met de politie gehad. Dit gebeurde nadat de ouders van een ander meisje een melding over de man hadden gemaakt. Ook toen waren er tijdens de rijlessen ongewilde aanrakingen en werden seksuele vragen gesteld.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586069","published_date":"2025-10-11T11:44:05","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:44:31.579566","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":247,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1833,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ook"],"persons":["euro betalen"],"locations":["Omroep"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1526,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Rijinstructeur","beroepsverbod","werkstraf","aanranding","leerling","Een 44-jarige rijinstructeur","de komende twee jaar","geen rijlessen","de aanranding","een 17-jarige leerling"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Rijinstructeur":2.0,"beroepsverbod":2.0,"werkstraf":2.0,"aanranding":2.0,"leerling":2.0,"Een 44-jarige rijinstructeur":1.0,"de komende twee jaar":1.0,"geen rijlessen":1.0,"de aanranding":1.0,"een 17-jarige leerling":1.0}},"age_hours":1.1076339866666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6662,"joy":0.0251,"surprise":0.1183,"sadness":0.0438,"fear":0.0576,"anger":0.0466,"disgust":0.0425},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":10,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":8,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a legal action resulting in a driving instructor being banned from teaching for two years and ordered to pay damages.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_bc50599a8709","title":"VN","content":"Honger in het door bendegeweld geteisterde Haïti neemt toe. Zo'n 5,7 miljoen inwoners - meer dan de helft van de bevolking - kampen met acute voedselonzekerheid. Dat meldt VN-voedselwaakhond IPC, die de voedselsituatie in onder meer Haïti monitort. Het IPC hanteert vijf categorieën van voedselonzekerheid. Een op de vijf mensen, ongeveer 2 miljoen Haïtianen, verkeert in een noodtoestand. Dan zijn er grote voedseltekorten, waardoor mensen gevaar lopen voor hun leven en gezondheid. Bijna 9000 mensen zitten in de hoogste categorie, die als catastrofaal en levensbedreigend wordt aangeduid. In de derde categorie, een crisistoestand, zitten nog eens 3,6 miljoen mensen. Dan hebben mensen moeite om aan hun basisvoedselbehoeften te voldoen. Voedselonzekerheid en hongersnood Het IPC bestaat uit 19 wereldwijde organisaties en ngo's die voedselcrises wereldwijd monitoren. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) is opgezet met als doel wereldleiders te voorzien van grondige, op bewijs gebaseerde analyses van de voedselonzekerheid en acute hongersnoden in de wereld. Met de resultaten kunnen medewerkers en beleidsmakers van ngo's, regeringen en VN-organisaties noodmaatregelen nemen en beleid voor de lange termijn ontwikkelen. Voedselonzekerheid en honger in Haïti zal het komende jaar alleen maar toenemen, waarschuwt het IPC. Dit komt door het aanhoudende bendegeweld. Gewapende bendes in Haïti hebben nu de controle over zo'n 90 procent van de hoofdstad Port-au-Prince. Door het bendegeweld in bijna alle delen van het land zijn het afgelopen jaar duizenden doden gevallen en slaan burgers op de vlucht. Volgens cijfers van de Internationale Organisatie voor Migratie (IOM) waren eind vorig jaar ongeveer een miljoen mensen intern ontheemd, een verdubbeling vergeleken met een half jaar eerder. Dat aantal is toegenomen tot 1,3 miljoen mensen nu. Martine Villeneuve, directeur van de ngo Action Against Hunger in Haïti, zegt dat de ergste fase van hongersnood nog niet is bereikt, ook al zitten zo'n 200.000 Haïtianen niet meer in acute voedselonzekerheid. Die voorzichtige vooruitgang biedt volgens haar geen garanties voor de toekomst. \"Zonder duurzame investeringen in de onderliggende oorzaken van voedselonzekerheid, blijft de situatie wankel.\" De honger in Haïti behoort nog tot de vijf ergste voedselzekerheidscrises ter wereld, waarbij meer dan de helft van de bevolking afhankelijk is van hulp, voegt Villeneuve eraan toe. Ook economisch gaat het er zeer slecht. Haïti is een van de armste landen ter wereld. In gebieden die onder controle zijn van gewapende groepen worden boeren afgeperst en kleine bedrijven worden gedwongen hun deuren te sluiten en inkomsten af te staan. Ook worden handelsroutes geblokkeerd, waardoor voedsel nauwelijks de steden bereikt en de economie platligt. Volgens persbureau AP moeten ongeveer 6 miljoen Haïtianen rondkomen van minder dan 2,41 dollar per dag. Ondertussen zijn de voedselprijzen in juli met 33 procent gestegen vergeleken met een jaar eerder. Eind september gaf de Veiligheidsraad van de VN groen licht voor de uitbreiding van een internationale veiligheidsmissie in Haïti, die sinds 2024 onder leiding van Kenia aanwezig is.
