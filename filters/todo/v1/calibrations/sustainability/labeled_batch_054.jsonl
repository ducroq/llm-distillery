However, conventional frameworks often depend on transmitting and storing raw personal data on centralized servers, posing challenges related to privacy, security, ethical compliance, and long-term sustainability. This study proposes a privacy-preserving framework that avoids the exposure of true health-related data. Sensor nodes encrypt collected measurements and collaborate with a secure computation core to evaluate health indicators under homomorphic encryption, maintaining confidentiality. For example, the system can determine whether a patient’s heart rate within a monitoring window falls inside clinically recommended thresholds, while the framework remains general enough to support a wide range of encrypted computations. A compliance verification client generates zero-knowledge range proofs, allowing external parties to verify whether health indicators meet predefined conditions without accessing actual values. Simulation results confirm the correctness of encrypted computation, controllability of threshold-based compliance judgments, and resistance to inference attacks. The proposed framework provides a practical solution for secure, auditable, and sustainable real-time health assessment in IoT-enabled public healthcare systems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9020","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.870682","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Yingjun Jiao","raw_content_length":1410,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IoT"],"persons":["Trustworthy Digital"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1400,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Privacy","The integration","Internet","Things IoT technologies","public healthcare","continuous monitoring","sustainable health management","conventional frameworks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Internet","Things IoT technologies"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Privacy":2.0,"The integration":1.0,"Internet":1.0,"Things IoT technologies":1.0,"public healthcare":1.0,"continuous monitoring":1.0,"sustainable health management":1.0,"conventional frameworks":1.0}},"age_hours":12.851967413333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.18,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.836,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7687,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0057,"sadness":0.011,"fear":0.0936,"anger":0.0426,"disgust":0.0675},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a privacy-preserving framework for IoT-enabled healthcare using homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs.

Building on the literature about the intention–behaviour gap, we examine the combined effect of role activation and environmental risk on pro-environmental preferences. A scenario-based behavioural experiment, conducted via oTree, integrated within-subject role framing (citizen, consumer, neutral) with randomised environmental risk conditions. Participants completed repeated binary choice tasks, where Eco-Preference was defined as the frequency with which they chose the sustainable option. The results indicate that activating a citizen role significantly increased Eco-Preference compared to consumer or neutral framings, while high-risk contexts did not directly boost sustainable behaviour. Instead, risk cues had an indirect effect through motivational states, highlighting the mediating role of Eco-Preference. Theoretically, this study advances Eco-Preference as a latent behavioural construct linking identity-based theories of responsibility with decision-based models of sustainability. Practically, the findings underscore the potential of role-based communication strategies to enhance ecological responsibility, suggesting that both policy and organisational interventions can benefit from fostering civic identities. Ultimately, the framework is applicable across cultures by offering a behavioural measure less prone to survey bias, supporting future comparative research on environmental decision-making.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9019","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.871312","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Antoni Korcyl","raw_content_length":1540,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Eco-Preference"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1530,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Roles","Risks","Responsibility","Foundations","Pro","This study","contextual framings","sustainable decision-making"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability","Pro"],"hydrogen_energy":["Pro"],"engineering":["Pro"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Roles":2.0,"Risks":2.0,"Responsibility":2.0,"Foundations":2.0,"Pro":2.0,"This study":1.0,"contextual framings":1.0,"sustainable decision-making":1.0}},"age_hours":12.85198227138889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.5305,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8074,"joy":0.0438,"surprise":0.0223,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.0661,"anger":0.0262,"disgust":0.0244},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study uses a scenario-based behavioural experiment to understand how role framing affects pro-environmental preferences.

This paper proposes a decomposition–reconstruction prediction method integrating Sample Entropy (SampEn), variational mode decomposition (VMD), and a variant Long Short-Term Memory network (vLSTM). SampEn determines the optimal decomposition parameters, VMD extracts intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and vLSTM, with peephole connections and coupled gates, conducts synchronous multi-IMF prediction. To explicitly account for environmental influences, a support vector regression (SVR) model driven by dew point temperature and vapor pressure deficit is employed to estimate the surface temperature variation ΔT. This component enhances the adaptability of the framework to dynamic storage conditions. The environment-derived ΔT is then integrated with the VMD-SampEn-vLSTM output to obtain the final forecast. Experiments on real-granary data from Liaoning, China demonstrate that the proposed method reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) by 25% and 14%, respectively, compared with baseline models, thus achieving a significant improvement in prediction performance.

Accurately tracking steppe degradation using remote sensing technology has emerged as a crucial scientific concern. Prior research failed to integrate ecosystem structure and function and lacked reference baselines, relying only on individual indicators to quantify degradation. To resolve these gaps, this study established a novel degradation evaluation index system integrating ecosystem structure and function, incorporating vegetation community distribution and proportions of degradation-indicator species to define reference states and quantify degradation severity. Analyzed spatiotemporal evolution and drivers across the temperate typical steppe (2013–2022). Key findings reveal (1) non-degraded and slightly degraded areas dominated (75.57% mean coverage), showing an overall fluctuating improvement trend; (2) minimal transitions between degradation levels, with stable conditions prevailing (59.52% unchanged area), indicating progressive degradation reversal; and (3) natural factors predominated as degradation drivers.

Traditional single-component soil amendments have proven inadequate for ecological restoration, underscoring the need for integrated and sustainable strategies to restore soil fertility and vegetation. A pot experiment using alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) evaluated the effects of weathered coal, cow manure, and potassium polyacrylate combined in a three-factor three-level orthogonal design on plant growth, nutrient uptake, and soil properties. Results showed that compared with the control (C0O0P0), amendment treatments significantly increased alfalfa fresh weight (+47.57~107.38%), dry weight (+43.46~104.93%), plant height (+43.46~104.93%), and stem diameter (+12.62~31.52%), along with improved plant phosphorus and potassium concentrations (+15.41~46.65%). Soil fertility was also notably enhanced, with increases in soil organic matter, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) ranging from 4.25% to 777.78%. In contrast, soil pH and bulk density were significantly reduced. The optimal amendment combination was identified as 10 g·kg−1 weathered coal, 5 g·kg−1 cow manure, and 0.6 g·kg−1 potassium polyacrylate. Structural equation modeling revealed that the amendments promoted plant growth both directly by improving soil conditions and indirectly by enhancing nutrient uptake. However, high doses (30 g·kg−1) of weathered coal may inhibit plant growth, and the co-application of high-dose weathered coal or manure with potassium polyacrylate may lead to antagonistic effects. This study provides fundamental insights into soil–plant interactions and proposes a sustainable amendment strategy for improving aeolian sandy soils, which could support future ecological reclamation efforts in coal mining area.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9010","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.872395","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Ruihao Cui","raw_content_length":1992,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Coal","Coal Mining Subsidence"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1898,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Medicago sativa","Sustainability","Pages","Amendment Ratios","Sustainable Recovery","Aeolian Sandy Soils","Coal Mining Subsidence Areas","Coal mining","the aeolian sandy regions","western China"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Medicago sativa":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Amendment Ratios":2.0,"Sustainable Recovery":2.0,"Aeolian Sandy Soils":2.0,"Coal Mining Subsidence Areas":2.0,"Coal mining":1.0,"the aeolian sandy regions":1.0,"western China":1.0}},"age_hours":12.852028358888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7833,"joy":0.0294,"surprise":0.0243,"sadness":0.0365,"fear":0.0183,"anger":0.0342,"disgust":0.0739},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study presents a pot experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of specific amendment ratios for restoring degraded soil in coal mining areas.

Both policy types demonstrate adverse spatial spillover effects, with no support found for the “pollution haven” or “race to the bottom” hypotheses.

However, its construction and maintenance phases often result in substantial environmental impacts, which must be addressed to improve the overall sustainability of railways. This study aims to identify solutions that improve the performance of railway tracks, reduce maintenance requirements, and minimize environmental impact. With this objective, the potential of artificial inclusions and innovative composite materials in enhancing the sustainability of railway tracks is investigated through a comprehensive methodology, combining experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. A novel composite material, comprising soil, scrap tire aggregates and an adhesive, demonstrated strong potential as a sustainable base layer for ballastless railway tracks, exhibiting minimal strain accumulation (0.29–0.98%) under 50,000 load cycles and adequate damping. Incorporation of cellular artificial inclusions in the substructure layers of ballasted tracks reduced cumulative settlement by up to 33% and slowed track geometry deterioration. Use of planar artificial inclusions beneath a pile-supported railway embankment enhanced the load transfer efficiency and curtailed settlement, while also lowering environmental impact by reducing concrete usage.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_571cc148262a","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9009: Optimizing Spatial Scales for Evaluating High","content":"High-resolution CO2 fossil fuel emission data are critical for developing targeted mitigation policies. As a key approach for estimating spatial distributions of CO2 emissions, top–down methods typically rely upon spatial proxies to disaggregate administrative-level emission to finer spatial scales. However, conventional linear regression models may fail to capture complex non-linear relationships between proxies and emissions. Furthermore, methods relying on nighttime light data are mostly inadequate in representing emissions for both industrial and rural zones. To address these limitations, this study developed a multiple proxy framework integrating nighttime light, points of interest (POIs), population, road networks, and impervious surface area data. Seven machine learning algorithms—Extra-Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, LightGBM, and Support Vector Regression—were comprehensively incorporated to estimate high-resolution CO2 fossil fuel emissions. Comprehensive evaluation revealed that the multiple proxy Extra-Trees model significantly outperformed the single-proxy nighttime light linear regression model at the county scale, achieving R2 = 0.96 (RMSE = 0.52 MtCO2) in cross-validation and R2 = 0.92 (RMSE = 0.54 MtCO2) on the independent test set. Feature importance analysis identified brightness of nighttime light (40.70%) and heavy industrial density (21.11%) as the most critical spatial proxies. The proposed approach also showed strong spatial consistency with the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China, exhibiting correlation coefficients of 0.82–0.84. This study demonstrates that integrating local multiple proxy data with machine learning corrects spatial biases inherent in traditional top–down approaches, establishing a transferable framework for high-resolution emissions mapping.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9009","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.873439","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Jun Cao","raw_content_length":1918,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CatBoost","Extra-Trees","XGBoost","Random Forest"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1868,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Spatial Scales","High-resolution CO2 fossil fuel emission data","targeted mitigation policies","a key approach","spatial distributions","CO2 emissions","topdown methods","spatial proxies"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Spatial Scales":2.0,"High-resolution CO2 fossil fuel emission data":1.0,"targeted mitigation policies":1.0,"a key approach":1.0,"spatial distributions":1.0,"CO2 emissions":1.0,"topdown methods":1.0,"spatial proxies":1.0}},"age_hours":12.852075430277779,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9008,"joy":0.004,"surprise":0.0102,"sadness":0.0138,"fear":0.022,"anger":0.0206,"disgust":0.0285},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research develops a machine learning framework to improve the accuracy of CO2 emission mapping, achieving R2 = 0.96 (RMSE = 0.52 MtCO2) in cross-validation.

The retailer engages in green education targeted at non-green-conscious consumers, providing clear product explanations to improve their willingness to pay for sustainable products, though this education is motivated by profit maximization rather than altruistic environmental responsibility. Our analysis reveals that while retailer green education can boost product R&D and adoption under certain conditions, this creates a ‘consumer education paradox’—a situation where green education could further enhance product R&D and adoption, but the retailer forgoes it because doing so does not contribute to profit. This occurs because profit-driven retailers limit education to self-beneficial ranges, creating tension between individual profit maximization and overall environmental performance. We then propose two government subsidy solutions—green product quantity subsidies and product R&D subsidies—to resolve this paradox. Both effectively alleviate the tension, but green innovation subsidies, despite requiring greater government investment, consistently outperform in fostering innovation and adoption, offering superior environmental outcomes.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9008","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.873784","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Wei Yan","raw_content_length":1605,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Walmart"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1523,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Sustainable Marketing","Can Retailers Profit","who","non-green-conscious consumers","practices","Walmart","a supply chain","the manufacturer"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Sustainable Marketing":2.0,"Can Retailers Profit":2.0,"who":2.0,"non-green-conscious consumers":2.0,"practices":1.0,"Walmart":1.0,"a supply chain":1.0,"the manufacturer":1.0}},"age_hours":12.852090025555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6688,"joy":0.0096,"surprise":0.0082,"sadness":0.0146,"fear":0.1013,"anger":0.108,"disgust":0.0895},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article models the impact of retailer-driven green education and government subsidies on sustainable product adoption.

However, the applicability of existing change detection methodologies based on remote sensing within complex mining areas under diverse climatic conditions remains systematically unverified. To address this gap and reveal nationwide disturbance patterns, this study systematically evaluates the performance of two algorithms—Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) and Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr)—in identifying vegetation loss across three major climatic zones of China (the humid, semi-humid, and semi-arid zones). Based on the optimal algorithm, the vegetation loss year and loss magnitude across all of China’s surface coal mining areas from 1990 to 2020 were accurately identified, enabling the reconstruction of the comprehensive, nationwide spatio-temporal pattern of mining-induced vegetation loss over the past 30 years. The results show that: (1) CCDC demonstrated superior stability and significantly higher accuracy (OA = 0.82) than LandTrendr (OA = 0.31) in identifying loss years across all zones. (2) The cumulative vegetation loss area reached 1429.68 km2, with semi-arid zones accounting for 86.76%. Temporal analysis revealed a continuous expansion of the loss area from 2003 to 2013, followed by a distinct inflection point and decline during 2014–2016 attributable to policy-driven regulations. (3) Further analysis revealed significant variations in the average magnitude of loss across different climatic zones, namely semi-arid (0.11), semi-humid (0.21), and humid (0.25). These findings underscore the imperative for region-specific restoration strategies to ensure effective conservation outcomes. This study provides a systematic quantification and analysis of long-term, nationwide evolution patterns and regional differentiation characteristics of vegetation loss induced by surface coal mining in China, offering critical support for sustainable development decision-making in balancing energy development and ecological conservation.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9011","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.874153","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":283,"author":"Chengye Zhang","raw_content_length":2189,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.415,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Detection of Trends","CCDC"],"persons":["Landsat"],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2149,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Large-scale vegetation loss","surface coal mining","a critical driver","regional ecological degradation","the applicability","existing change detection methodologies","remote sensing","complex mining areas"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Large-scale vegetation loss":1.0,"surface coal mining":1.0,"a critical driver":1.0,"regional ecological degradation":1.0,"the applicability":1.0,"existing change detection methodologies":1.0,"remote sensing":1.0,"complex mining areas":1.0}},"age_hours":12.85210444722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.6874999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8625,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8627,"joy":0.0062,"surprise":0.0229,"sadness":0.0206,"fear":0.0275,"anger":0.0357,"disgust":0.0246},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study provides a systematic quantification of vegetation loss due to coal mining using remote sensing data and algorithms.

Employing a panel data framework, this investigation analyzes A-share listed firms in China from 2011 to 2023. In terms of supply chain perspectives, this study utilizes fixed effects models, mediation analysis, and moderation analysis to empirically examine how downstream enterprises’ digital transformation affects the sustainability of upstream enterprises’ green innovation, while deconstructing the “capability–motivation” dual pathway underlying such sustainability. The key findings are as follows: (1) downstream digital transformation significantly strengthens upstream green innovation persistence through both capability reinforcement and motivation amplification, with a notably stronger impact on the latter; (2) mechanism tests show that capability improvement primarily arises from knowledge spillovers and enhanced supply–demand coordination efficiency, while motivation enhancement stems from intensified market competition and greater responsiveness to tax incentives; and (3) supply chain structural characteristics exert critical moderating effects.

Territorial cohesion is the result of the interaction between two categories of forces: centripetal, which tends to maintain its cohesion, and centrifugal, which tends to break it up. These forces are the combined result of several categories of factors (ethnic, historical and geopolitical, demographic, and social–economic) which characterize each state and territory. The degree of accessibility is a composite indicator that accumulates the influence of natural and economic–social factors through the degree of development of the communications infrastructure on territorial cohesion. Accessibility is of crucial importance, especially in the case of relatively ethnically homogeneous states. Our study analyzes these aspects of territorial cohesion and administrative organization in the case of Romania, a state located in a European region of geopolitical interference and instability. By using a methodology on the critical analysis of data, documents, and bibliographic sources in Romania, the results of our study indicate changes in the relations between cities and subordinate human settlements that occurred in the last five decades, as well as the lack of financial viability of many administrative–territorial units.

An artificial neural network integrated with multi-objective particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) was employed to identify optimal operating parameters. The optimized configurations improved BTE and reduced NOx emissions across all loads; for example, at 75% load, BTE increased from 30.38% (average) to 32.13% (optimum), while simultaneously reducing the NOx emissions from 1322 ppm (average) to 1272 ppm (optimum). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed load as the most significant factor (p < 0.001), followed by injection timing and NP size. The model predictions closely matched experimental results, validating the optimization approach.

This study examined wood (WP), palm-pruning (PP), reed (RD), and daphne (DP) pellets. We present a compact framework linking composition (proximate/ultimate and lignocellulosic fractions) with TG/DTG, FTIR, TGA-derived indices (CPI, Ddev, Rw), Tpmax and Rav to predict product selectivity and temperature ranges. TG/DTG showed the following sequence: hemicellulose (≈200–315 °C) first, cellulose (≈315–400 °C) with a sharp maximum, and lignin ≈200–600 °C. Low-ash WP and DP had sharper, higher peaks, favoring concentrated devolatilization and condensables. Mineral-rich PP and RD began earlier and showed depressed peaks from AAEM catalysis, shifting toward gases and ash-richer chars. Composition shaped these patterns: higher cellulose increased Rav and CPI; links to Tpmax were moderated by ash. Lignin strengthened a high-T shoulder, while hemicellulose promoted early deacetylation (RD’s 1730 cm−1 acetyl C=O) and release of CO2 and acids. Correlations (|r| ≥ 0.70) supported these links: VM with total (m∞) and second stage mass loss; cellulose with Rav and CPI (Tpmax moderated by ash); lignin and O/C with Tf and last stage mass loss; ash negatively with Ti, Tpmax, and m∞.

Electric School Buses (ESBs) are a particular area of interest due to their environmental and financial potential benefits, including Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) synergies. Storing electricity in times of lower demand to supply the grid at optimal times can provide significant sustainability benefits, among them a reduction in new generation capacity and financial revenue for battery owners. ESBs, with their high-capacity batteries, have significant potential to supply the grid in V2G systems. There are more than half a million school buses in the US, with a wide geographical distribution, which have significant idle times during school days and holidays. This presents very attractive investment possibilities, providing school districts with additional revenue and supplying local communities with sustainable electricity at high-demand times. This study develops a framework to financially evaluate sustainability of ESB V2G schemes in the US. It applies data analytics, GIS, and Business Intelligence to integrate and assess publicly available data to provide stakeholders with decision-making tools in selecting optimal locations and operation times for these projects. Results indicate that revenue for these projects is significant in most schools, with some locations generating very high revenue potential. Geospatial analysis for most locations and time frames indicates very promising results, with schools potentially receiving significant income from these systems.

Its portfolio encompasses ecological, cultural, adventure, and rural modalities that contribute to local economies and community well-being. This study employs a mixed-methods design combining documentary analysis with fifty semi-structured interviews conducted across five provinces, engaging stakeholders such as hotel managers, travel agencies, restaurateurs, agroecological farmers, museum directors, café entrepreneurs, and ecotourism operators. The findings reveal that innovation, particularly through infrastructure, modernization, digital adoption, and service professionalization—is critical to strengthening competitiveness. However, persistent challenges include stakeholder fragmentation and the absence of a coordinated promotional strategy, both of which limit visibility and shared value generation. To address these challenges, the study proposes integrated innovation pathways, including thematic circuits (heritage, independence, and coffee routes), personalized tourism experiences, and the use of digital and experiential marketing tools. These approaches highlight the need for collaborative governance involving public, private, and community actors. The article contributes empirical evidence to the debate on tourism innovation and sustainability in emerging regions, underscoring Boyacá’s paradox: global recognition coexists with fragmented governance. It argues that innovation-driven strategies, aligned with sustainability principles, are essential for consolidating Boyacá as a competitive and regenerative tourism destination.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9000","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:20.876892","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Fabio Alonso Bonilla Gómez","raw_content_length":1839,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Value Chain"],"persons":["Boyacá Boyacá","café"],"locations":["the Colombian Andes"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1775,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Boyacá","Pages","Innovation","the Value Chain","the Tourism Sector","a department","the Colombian Andes","an emerging tourism destination","strong potential"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"business_innovation":["Innovation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":4.0,"Boyacá":3.0,"Pages":2.0,"Innovation":2.0,"the Value Chain":2.0,"the Tourism Sector":2.0,"a department":1.0,"the Colombian Andes":1.0,"an emerging tourism destination":1.0,"strong potential":1.0}},"age_hours":12.8522162025,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.701500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9403,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8328,"joy":0.0351,"surprise":0.0126,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0396,"anger":0.027,"disgust":0.0467},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes integrated innovation pathways for sustainable tourism in Boyacá, but it primarily focuses on strategies and recommendations rather than concrete actions with measurable outcomes.

{"id":"science_philosophy_technology_17a145f3a6f1","title":"A Network Approach to Public Trust in Generative AI","content":"As generative AI becomes more deeply integrated into society, building public trust in this technology has emerged as a key challenge for policymakers. Existing approaches, such as the European Commission’s Trustworthy AI framework, largely seek to tackle this issue by offering comprehensive technical and legal measures for promoting a more trustworthy AI industry. However, this paper argues that such approaches are limited in scope and do not fully account for the social complexity of generative AI. As these technologies can now replicate modes of human communication and contribute to our collective knowledge, they cannot be simply considered products to be regulated. Rather, they exist as active social actors and AI policy should reflect this. To better account for this social role, this paper develops a network approach to trust in AI inspired by philosophy of technology and Actor-Network Theory (ANT). This approach argues that trust emerges, first and foremost, from the material interactions between social actors involved in a vast and precarious network. In the context of generative AI, this material network extends far beyond the AI industry to include those various actors that are not directly involved in AI development but that nonetheless influence public trust. As such, this paper argues that the policy goal of establishing trustworthy AI, and thus promoting public trust in AI, is not solely a matter of promoting a more trustworthy AI industry. Rather, to achieve such a goal, more diverse policy solutions need to be devised on the basis of social interactions as part of a whole-of-society approach. Primarily, this paper highlights that public trust in generative AI is influenced by those actors that play a key role in socio-political discourse such as political figures, media organizations, academic institutions and government bodies, among others. As such, public trust in generative AI is linked to trust in our information environment more broadly. To conclude, the paper argues that policymakers seeking to promote trustworthy AI must first seek to combat the current post-truth political crisis and restore public trust in democratic institutions.","source":"science_philosophy_technology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-025-00974-6","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:46:26.555677","language":"en","tags":["society","technology","philosophy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Latest Results","source_category":"science","word_count":337,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2201,"priority":8,"update_frequency":168,"reading_time_minutes":1.685,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the European Commission’s Trustworthy AI","ANT","Actor-Network Theory"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2194,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Network Approach","Public Trust","Generative AI","generative AI","society","public trust","this technology","a key challenge","policymakers","Existing approaches"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Generative AI"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Network Approach":2.0,"Public Trust":2.0,"Generative AI":2.0,"generative AI":1.0,"society":1.0,"public trust":1.0,"this technology":1.0,"a key challenge":1.0,"policymakers":1.0,"Existing approaches":1.0}},"age_hours":12.853324819722221,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.711,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9422,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9118,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.0053,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0263,"anger":0.0198,"disgust":0.0203},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a network approach to building public trust in generative AI, arguing that trust is linked to the broader information environment and democratic institutions.

Zinc ions (Zn2+), the second most abundant plasma cation, have been shown to bind and regulate the activity of certain coagulation proteins can also bind and modulate the activity of several coagulation proteins through structural alterations. However, their role in membrane-protein interactions remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how Ca2+ and Zn2+; influence the structure and function of human protein Z (PZ), a cofactor of protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) that inhibits clotting factor Xa on phospholipid surfaces. Zn2+ was found to substitute for Ca2+ in the Gla domain of PZ and promote its membrane binding by inducing conformational changes like Ca2+. Additionally, a Zn2+ located in the epidermal growth factor1 (EGF1) domain of PZ appeared to synergize with Ca2+ to enhance the membrane affinity of PZ. Furthermore, both Ca2+ and Zn2+ were suggested to destabilize PZ-ZPI complex, thereby modulating the cofactor activity of PZ, a finding that warrants further experimental investigations. Collectively, this study provides the first structural and functional characterization of Zn2+ bound PZ, offering new insights into metal ion driven structural dynamics of PZ and their implications in coagulation regulation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681514v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:47:15.597153","language":"en","tags":["biology","preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Gayathri, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_03d53d2c845e","title":"A General Transformer","content":"Predicting enzyme-small molecule interactions is critical for drug discovery and generally understanding the biochemical processes of life. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promising results, several challenges remain: the lack of a comprehensive training dataset, architectures lacking communication between representations of enzymes and small molecules, the tendency to simplify the problem as enzyme-substrate vs. enzyme-non-interacting, and thereby, misclassify enzyme-inhibitor pairs as substrates, and the negligence of the true impact of data leakage on the model's performance. To address these issues, we present EMMA (Enzyme-small Molecule interaction Multi-head Attention), a transformer-based multi-task learning framework designed to learn pairwise interaction signals between enzymes and small molecules, that can well generalise to out-of-distribution data. EMMA operates directly on the SMILES string representation of small molecules and enzyme sequences, with two classification heads that distinguish enzyme-non-interacting, enzyme-substrate, and enzyme-inhibitor pairs. By evaluating EMMA under five distinct data-splitting regimes that control for different types of data leakage, we demonstrate that EMMA achieves a strong and robust performance, particularly for previously unseen combinations of enzymes and small molecules. Further, a deeper analysis highlights that the topological properties of the enzyme-small molecule interaction network are crucial for the model performance and its ability to generalise, yet again stressing the decisive role of well-designed training datasets for successful model training.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681419v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:47:15.597489","language":"en","tags":["biology","preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Atabaigielmi, V., Joeres, R., Kalinina, O.

Here, we present the first complete chloroplast genome of Paeonia suffruticosa Cun Song Ying. Using high-throughput sequencing combined with multiple bioinformatics approaches, we comprehensively characterized its chloroplast genome and compared it with those of closely related taxa. The chloroplast genome of Cun Song Ying is 152,704 bp in length and exhibits the typical quadripartite structure, comprising a large single-copy region (LSC), a small single-copy region (SSC), and two inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb). A total of 138 genes were annotated, including 4 pseudogenes and 134 functional genes, which consist of 87 protein-coding genes, 39 tRNAs, and 8 rRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cun Song Ying shares the closest relationship with P. suffruticosa Luo Yang Hong. These findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of peony plastids, and the identified highly variable regions may serve as potential DNA barcodes for cultivar identification.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681658v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:47:15.597766","language":"en","tags":["biology","preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Li, M., Cheng, W., Hong, C.","raw_content_length":1094,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LSC","SSC"],"persons":["Cun Song Ying"],"locations":["Paeonia","Chloroplast"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1090,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Paeonia suffruticosa Cun Song Ying","Comparative analysis","the chloroplast genome","plastid characteristics","phylogenetic relationships","Chloroplast","valuable insights","plant evolution","phylogeny","molecular breeding"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Paeonia suffruticosa Cun Song Ying":3.0,"Comparative analysis":2.0,"the chloroplast genome":2.0,"plastid characteristics":2.0,"phylogenetic relationships":2.0,"Chloroplast":1.0,"valuable insights":1.0,"plant evolution":1.0,"phylogeny":1.0,"molecular breeding":1.0}},"age_hours":12.85498309361111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9118,"joy":0.0169,"surprise":0.0359,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0049,"anger":0.0098,"disgust":0.0161},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research provides genomic data for peony cultivar identification, which could indirectly support sustainable agriculture by improving breeding programs.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6eaf9c911d5c","title":"TFEB","content":"Lysosomal transmembrane protein TMEM106B is genetically and neuropathologically implicated in a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Unexpectedly, the recurrent de novo TMEM106B variant p.(Asp252Asn) causes a hypomyelinating disorder. TMEM106B controls lysosomal positioning in neurons, but its role in white matter health is not fully understood. To study the role of TMEM106B in myelination in vivo, we mutated zebrafish tmem106ba and tmem106bb homologs. In vivo brain imaging in larvae deficient for both homologs (tmem106bdm) showed more, smaller lysosomes, accompanied by reduced myelin content and shorter myelin sheaths. Oligodendrocytes in tmem106bdm exhibited more lysosomes in the perinuclear region. We next genome-edited the pathogenic p.(Asp252Asn) variant into the zebrafish genome and showed that it acts dominant-negatively on myelination and on lysosomal clustering around the nucleus in oligodendrocytes. As lysosomal peri-nuclear positioning modulates mTOR-signaling, and downstream transcription factor EB (TFEB) inhibits myelination, we next investigated whether there is a genetic interaction between TMEM106B and TFEB. Indeed, deficient myelination in tmem106bdm larvae, but not altered lysosomal clustering, was restored by loss of Tfeb in triple mutant larvae. Our work elucidates that TMEM106B modulates myelination by a TFEB-dependent pathway. This implicates the TFEB pathway in myelin development and white matter health and suggests that modulating TFEB could be a therapeutic target in white matter disorders.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681547v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T12:47:15.598059","language":"en","tags":["biology","preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Berdowski, W., van der Linde, H.
