In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23542","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.067057","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","cond-matstat-mech","physicssoc-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Nuno Crokidakis, Lucas Sigaud","raw_content_length":1352,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Statistical Physics"],"persons":["arXiv:2507.23542v2 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1351,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Statistical Physics perspective","fairness","shared expenses","The bar bill analogy","arXiv250723542v2 Announce Type","Abstract","individuals","varying amounts","shared meals","bar gatherings"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["fairness"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Statistical Physics perspective":2.0,"fairness":2.0,"shared expenses":2.0,"The bar bill analogy":2.0,"arXiv250723542v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"individuals":1.0,"varying amounts":1.0,"shared meals":1.0,"bar gatherings":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7524460791666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3323,"joy":0.1912,"surprise":0.394,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0159,"anger":0.0504,"disgust":0.0118},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical framework using statistical physics to analyze fairness in shared expenses.

While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by both the assumptions underlying the Vlasov forcing term and the approximation introduced by the Enskog collision term for short-range molecular interactions. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, transport coefficients, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The results confirm that deviations from the Maxwellian distribution persist in the vapour region, indicating limitations of the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation under pronounced non-equilibrium conditions.

The proposed DNN architecture includes multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU activation, 3 hidden layers (256, 128, 64 neurons respectively), uses Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and MSE loss function. It learns from pilot signals to predict channel matrices, achieving lower NMSE and BER across different SNR levels.

Results show the DNN outperforms LS and MMSE by 3-5 dB in NMSE at medium SNR, with robust performance in high-mobility scenarios. The study evaluates metrics like NMSE vs. SNR, BER vs. SNR, and sensitivity to pilot length, antenna configurations, and computational complexity.

Specifically, a transmitter (Alice) sends confidential information to its intended user (Bob) indoors, while several eavesdroppers (Eves) lurk outside. To safeguard the transmission from eavesdropping, the STAR-IRS is deployed on walls or windows. Upon impinging on the STAR-IRS, the incoming electromagnetic wave is dynamically partitioned into two components, enabling both transmission through and reflection from the surface. The reflected signal is controlled to enhance reception at Bob, while the transmitted signal is modulated with symbol-level random phase shifts to degrade the signal quality at Eves. Based on such a setting, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated. To solve it, a graph neural network (GNN)-based scheme is developed. Furthermore, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based GNN accelerator is designed to reduce computational latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms both the conventional scheme and the reflection-only scheme in terms of secrecy performance. Moreover, the GNN-based approach achieves superior results compared to benchmark techniques such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero forcing (ZF), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) in solving the optimization problem. Finally, experimental evaluations confirm that the FPGA-based accelerator enables low inference latency.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11925","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.588078","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","systems","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Yanan Du, Zeyang Sun, Yilan Zhang, Sai Xu, Beiyuan Liu","raw_content_length":1572,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Eves","Alice"],"persons":["Bob"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1571,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["STAR","the STAR-IRS","Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","a secure indoor communication scheme","simultaneous transmitting","intelligent reflecting surface","STAR-IRS","a transmitter"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["STAR"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"STAR":2.0,"the STAR-IRS":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a secure indoor communication scheme":1.0,"simultaneous transmitting":1.0,"intelligent reflecting surface":1.0,"STAR-IRS":1.0,"a transmitter":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7527333708333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8397,"joy":0.0129,"surprise":0.0132,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0797,"anger":0.0227,"disgust":0.0243},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a secure indoor communication scheme using STAR-IRS to reduce eavesdropping.

However, existing DMs are primarily trained in a supervised manner by using a large corpus of clean images. This reliance on clean data poses fundamental challenges in many real-world scenarios, where acquiring noise-free data is hard or infeasible, and only noisy and potentially incomplete measurements are available. While some methods can train DMs using noisy data, they are generally effective only when the amount of noise is very mild or when some additional noise-free data is available. In addition, existing methods for training DMs from incomplete measurements require access to multiple complementary acquisition processes, an assumption that poses a significant practical limitation. Here we introduce the first approach for learning DMs for image restoration using only noisy measurement data from a single operator. As a first key contribution, we show that DMs, and more broadly minimum mean squared error denoisers, exhibit a weak form of scale equivariance linking rescaling in signal amplitude to changes in noise intensity. We then leverage this theoretical insight to develop a denoising score-matching strategy that generalizes robustly to noise levels lower than those present in the training data, thereby enabling the learning of DMs from noisy measurements. To further address the challenges of incomplete and noisy data, we integrate our method with equivariant imaging, a complementary self-supervised learning framework that exploits the inherent invariants of imaging problems, to train DMs for image restoration from single-operator measurements that are both incomplete and noisy. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on image denoising, demosaicing, and inpainting, along with comparisons with the state of the art.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11964","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.588520","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","research","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":282,"author":"Brett Levac, Jon Tamir, Marcelo Pereyra, Julian Tachella","raw_content_length":1943,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.41,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1942,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Normalization","arXiv251011964v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Diffusion models","DMs","a powerful framework","image generation","restoration","existing DMs","a supervised manner"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Normalization":2.0,"arXiv251011964v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Diffusion models":1.0,"DMs":1.0,"a powerful framework":1.0,"image generation":1.0,"restoration":1.0,"existing DMs":1.0,"a supervised manner":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752747743611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.818,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0111,"sadness":0.0104,"fear":0.0883,"anger":0.0344,"disgust":0.0328},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel method for training diffusion models using only noisy data, which could potentially improve image restoration in scenarios where clean data is unavailable.

However, the sensing performance of matched and mismatched filtering schemes can be significantly deteriorated due to the signaling randomness induced by finite-alphabet modulations with nonconstant modulus, such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellations. Therefore, improving sensing performance without significantly compromising communication capability (i.e., maintaining randomness), remains a challenging task. To that end, we propose a unified probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) framework that is compatible with both matched and mismatched filtering schemes, by maximizing the communication rate while imposing constraints on mean square error (MSE) of sensing channel state information (CSI), power, and probability distribution. Specifically, the MSE of sensing CSI is leveraged to optimize sensing capability, which is illustrated to be a more comprehensive metric compared to the output SNR after filtering (SNRout) and integrated sidelobes ratio (ISLR). Additionally, the internal relationships among these three sensing metrics are explicitly analyzed. Finally, both simulations and field measurements validate the efficiency of proposed PCS approach in achieving a flexible S&C trade-off, as well as its credibility in enhancing 6G wireless transmission in real-world scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12204","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.590163","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","systems","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Zhen Du, Jingjing Xu, Yifeng Xiong, Jie Wang, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch, Fan Liu, Shi Jin","raw_content_length":1653,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["QAM","OFDM","OFDM ISAC Signals Under Temporal","PCS"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1648,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Probabilistic Constellation Shaping","OFDM ISAC Signals","Temporal","ISAC","arXiv251012204v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Integrated sensing","communications","an innovative technology"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Probabilistic Constellation Shaping":2.0,"OFDM ISAC Signals":2.0,"Temporal":2.0,"ISAC":2.0,"arXiv251012204v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Integrated sensing":1.0,"communications":1.0,"an innovative technology":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7528052661111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8199,"joy":0.0209,"surprise":0.0447,"sadness":0.0163,"fear":0.0274,"anger":0.0351,"disgust":0.0358},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel constellation shaping framework for ISAC signals, aiming to improve sensing performance while maintaining communication capability.

A circulant Hadamard matrix $H$ is a Hadamard matrix that has rows of entries in cyclic order. There exist only $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices of order 4, and here, we provide a novel construction of all such $8$ circulant Hadamard matrices using a linear operator and generalized Boolean function (GBF). The constructed circulant Hadamard matrices are used recursively to construct a binary cross Z-complementary set (CZCS) of all lengths with an even phase, a binary Golay complementary set (GCS) of all lengths, and Hadamard matrices of order $2^{n+2}$, where $n\\geq1$. The construction of a binary CZCS covering all lengths was not available before. We also propose an alternative, lower-complexity construction of binary GCSs of all lengths and Hadamard matrices of order $2^{a+1}10^b26^c$ using circulant matrices, where $ a,b,c \\geq 0$. The proposed binary GCS covers all lengths with a flexible flock size. The constructions of GCS are further extended to form binary complete complementary code (CCC) of the parameter $(2N,2N,2N)-CCC$ where $N=2^a10^b26^c, a,b,c \\geq 0$. The constructed binary CCC provides a flexible flock size. The construction of CZCS is further extended to form a binary optimal cross-Z complementary sequence set (CZCSS) of the parameter $(2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+2}, 2^{n+1})-CZCSS$, where $n\\geq1$. Finally, we provide a relation between Hadamard matrices and GCS, which enables the study of the Hadamard conjecture in a new direction. We also provided a few properties of circulant matrices over aperiodic cross-correlation (ACCF) and aperiodic auto-correlation (AACF), which are used to prove the theorems. All proposed constructions are novel, and their parameters are compared with the existing state-of-the-art.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12315","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.591843","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","systems","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":292,"author":"Piyush Priyanshu, Sudhan Majhi, Subhabrata Paul","raw_content_length":1951,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.46,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CZCS","CCC","GBF","GCS","Hadamard","CZCSS arXiv:2510.12315v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["Circulant Hadamard Matrices","n\\geq1$."],"locations":[],"monetary":["only $8$","2^{n+2}$","$8$"]},"char_count":1950,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A New Method","Constructing","Hadamard Matrices","Circulant Hadamard Matrices","CZCS","GCS","CCC","CZCSS","entries","order"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A New Method":2.0,"Constructing":2.0,"Hadamard Matrices":2.0,"Circulant Hadamard Matrices":2.0,"CZCS":2.0,"GCS":2.0,"CCC":2.0,"CZCSS":2.0,"entries":2.0,"order":2.0}},"age_hours":2.752866511666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8788,"joy":0.024,"surprise":0.0788,"sadness":0.0034,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.0088,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel mathematical method for constructing Hadamard matrices and related structures.

Without additional precautions, there is a high risk that the adaptive filter - intended to cancel the feedback path - also suppresses parts of the desired signal. One solution is to decorrelate the loudspeaker and microphone signals. In this work, we combine the two decorrelation approaches frequency shifting and phase modulation in a unified framework: a so-called \\textit{phase synthesizer}, implemented in a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter bank. Furthermore, we extend the phase modulation technique using variable delay lines, as known from vibrato and chorus effects. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed phase synthesizer using an example from speech in-car communication, employing an adaptive frequency-domain Kalman filter.

In this system, a noise suppression VAE (NSVAE) learns to extract clean speech representations from noisy speech using pretrained clean speech and noise VAEs with skip connections. In this paper, we improve DCCRN-VAE by incorporating three key modifications: 1) removing the skip connections in the pretrained VAEs to encourage more informative speech and noise latent representations; 2) using $\\beta$-VAE in pretraining to better balance reconstruction and latent space regularization; and 3) a NSVAE generating both speech and noise latent representations. Experiments show that the proposed system achieves comparable performance as the DCCRN and DCCRN-VAE baselines on the matched DNS3 dataset but outperforms the baselines on mismatched datasets (WSJ0-QUT, Voicebank-DEMEND), demonstrating improved generalization ability. In addition, an ablation study shows that a similar performance can be achieved with classical fine-tuning instead of adversarial training, resulting in a simpler training pipeline.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12485","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.597245","language":"en","tags":["eessas","research","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Jiatong Li, Simon Doclo","raw_content_length":1207,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["An Improved Deep Representation Learning Framework","noisy speech","DCCRN-VAE","VAE","DCCRN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1206,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["I-DCCRN-VAE","An Improved Deep Representation Learning Framework","Complex VAE","arXiv251012485v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a complex variational autoencoder","VAE-based single-channel speech enhancement system","the DCCRN architecture","this system","a noise suppression VAE"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"I-DCCRN-VAE":2.0,"An Improved Deep Representation Learning Framework":2.0,"Complex VAE":2.0,"arXiv251012485v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a complex variational autoencoder":1.0,"VAE-based single-channel speech enhancement system":1.0,"the DCCRN architecture":1.0,"this system":1.0,"a noise suppression VAE":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7530673083333337,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.329,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8658,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8118,"joy":0.0829,"surprise":0.0753,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0041,"anger":0.0153,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes an improved algorithm for speech enhancement, demonstrating comparable or better performance on existing datasets.

Recently, large-scale EEG foundation models have been developed, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and subjects. However, the heterogeneity of EEG devices not only hinders the widespread adoption of these models but also poses significant challenges to their further scaling and development. In this paper, we introduce HEAR, the first EEG foundation model explicitly designed to support heterogeneous EEG devices, accommodating varying electrode layouts and electrode counts. HEAR employs a learnable, coordinate-based spatial embedding to map electrodes with diverse layouts and varying counts into a unified representational space. This unified spatial representation is then processed by a novel spatially-guided transformer, which effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies across electrodes. To support the development of HEAR, we construct a large-scale EEG dataset comprising 8,782 hours of data collected from over 150 distinct electrode layouts with up to 1,132 electrodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAR substantially outperforms existing EEG foundation models in supporting heterogeneous EEG devices and generalizing across diverse cognitive tasks and subjects.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12515","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.597661","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","systems","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Zhige Chen, Chengxuan Qin, Wenlong You, Rui Liu, Congying Chu, Rui Yang, Kay Chen Tan, Jibin Wu","raw_content_length":1403,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EEG"],"persons":["Electroencephalography"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1402,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HEAR","An EEG Foundation Model","Heterogeneous Electrode Adaptive Representation","arXiv251012515v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Electroencephalography","EEG","an essential technique","neuroscience research and brain-computer interface","BCI applications"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["neuroscience research and brain-computer interface"],"research_academic":["neuroscience research and brain-computer interface"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HEAR":2.0,"An EEG Foundation Model":2.0,"Heterogeneous Electrode Adaptive Representation":2.0,"arXiv251012515v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Electroencephalography":1.0,"EEG":1.0,"an essential technique":1.0,"neuroscience research and brain-computer interface":1.0,"BCI applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7530816375,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8779,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0389,"sadness":0.0189,"fear":0.0183,"anger":0.0173,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel EEG foundation model (HEAR) designed for heterogeneous EEG devices.

Camera-based communications technology, also referred to as Optical Camera Communications (OCC) in the literature, is a novel approach that could bring a valuable solution to such a complex task. In such system, the UAVs are equipped with LEDs that act as beacons and with cameras allowing them to locate the LEDs of other UAVs. Specific blinking sequences are assigned to the LEDs of each of the UAVs in order to uniquely identify them. This camera-based relative localization and identification system is immune to Radio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic interference and operates in Global Navigation satellite (GNSS) denied environments.

However, existing methods typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking inherent synergies between them as correlated steps in the analysis pipeline. In this work, we present the anatomically and metabolically informed diffusion (AMDiff) model, a unified framework for denoising and lesion/organ segmentation in low-count PET imaging. By integrating multi-task functionality and exploiting the mutual benefits of these tasks, AMDiff enables direct quantification of clinical metrics, such as total lesion glycolysis (TLG), from low-count inputs. The AMDiff model incorporates a semantic-informed denoiser based on diffusion strategy and a denoising-informed segmenter utilizing nnMamba architecture. The segmenter constrains denoised outputs via a lesion-organ-specific regularizer, while the denoiser enhances the segmenter by providing enriched image information through a denoising revision module. These components are connected via a warming-up mechanism to optimize multi-task interactions. Experiments on multi-vendor, multi-center, and multi-noise-level datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AMDiff.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13257","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.609396","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","research","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Menghua Xia, Kuan-Yin Ko, Der-Shiun Wang, Ming-Kai Chen, Qiong Liu, Huidong Xie, Liang Guo, Wei Ji, Jinsong Ouyang, Reimund Bayerlein, Benjamin A.

Undersampling k-space accelerates imaging but makes accurate reconstruction challenging. Supervised deep learning methods achieve impressive results but rely on large fully sampled datasets, which are difficult to obtain. Recently, implicit neural representations (INR) have emerged as a powerful unsupervised paradigm that reconstructs images from a single undersampled dataset without external training data. However, existing INR-based methods still face challenges when applied to highly undersampled dynamic MRI, mainly due to their inefficient representation capacity and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose TenF-INR, a novel unsupervised framework that integrates low-rank tensor modeling with INR, where each factor matrix in the tensor decomposition is modeled as a learnable factor function. Specifically,we employ INR to model learnable tensor functions within a low-rank decomposition, reducing the parameter space and computational burden. A patch-based nonlocal tensor modeling strategy further exploits temporal correlations and inter-patch similarities, enhancing the recovery of fine spatiotemporal details. Experiments on dynamic cardiac and abdominal datasets demonstrate that TenF-INR achieves up to 21-fold acceleration, outperforming both supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art methods in image quality, temporal fidelity, and quantitative accuracy.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21894","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:30.611423","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","research","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Yuanyuan Liu, Yuanbiao Yang, Jing Cheng, Zhuo-Xu Cui, Qingyong Zhu, Congcong Liu, Yuliang Zhu, Jingran Xu, Hairong Zheng, Dong Liang, Yanjie Zhu","raw_content_length":1545,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["INR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1544,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Unsupervised patch","Announce Type","Dynamic MRI","limited spatiotemporal resolution","long acquisition times","Undersampling k-space","accurate reconstruction","Supervised deep learning methods","impressive results","large fully sampled datasets"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["limited spatiotemporal resolution"],"business_innovation":["long acquisition times"],"ai_ml":["Supervised deep learning methods"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Unsupervised patch":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Dynamic MRI":1.0,"limited spatiotemporal resolution":1.0,"long acquisition times":1.0,"Undersampling k-space":1.0,"accurate reconstruction":1.0,"Supervised deep learning methods":1.0,"impressive results":1.0,"large fully sampled datasets":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7535713975,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.634500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7269,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7641,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0851,"sadness":0.0817,"fear":0.0204,"anger":0.0166,"disgust":0.0236},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel unsupervised framework (TenF-INR) for dynamic MRI reconstruction, potentially reducing the need for large, fully sampled datasets.

{"id":"science_frontiers_neuroscience_a288ac315a4d","title":"Endovascular management of tandem embolic stroke due to cardioembolic free","content":"BackgroundTandem lesions (TLs), defined as simultaneous occlusions of both extracranial and intracranial arteries, represent a particularly challenging subset of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. While most TLs are attributed to atherosclerotic changes or arterial dissection, a smaller subset originates from cardioembolic emboli arising from the heart or aortic arch, commonly referred to as embolic tandem lesions. In rare instances, these emboli form a free-floating thrombus (FFT) in the carotid artery, characterized by mobile intraluminal thrombotic material with high embolic potential. Optimal treatment strategies for these rare and complex cases remain undefined.Case summaryWe present a rare case involving an embolic tandem lesion in a 73-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation who presented with acute ischemic stroke upon awakening. Imaging and angiography demonstrated a free-floating thrombus (FFT) at the brachiocephalic bifurcation extending into the origins of the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries, a free-floating thrombus at the carotid bifurcation, and an additional thrombus occluding the right ICA terminus and the origin of the M1 segment. A staged endovascular approach was employed: intracranial recanalization was first achieved via mechanical thrombectomy, followed by stent-assisted stabilization of the residual free-floating thrombus within the common carotid artery. The patient experienced significant neurological improvement and attained functional independence at 3-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity associated with embolic tandem lesions and carotid FFT involvement. Comprehensive preprocedural imaging, including assessment of the aortic arch and cervical vessels, is critical. A personalized, multi-modality endovascular approach combining thrombectomy and stenting can enable successful revascularization and favorable clinical outcomes, particularly when FFT complicates tandem occlusions.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1654601","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:34.747942","language":"en","tags":["neuroscience","frontiers","case_report","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Liang Li","raw_content_length":2016,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.295,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FFT","BackgroundTandem","LVO","tandem embolic"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2016,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Endovascular management","tandem embolic stroke","BackgroundTandem lesions","TLs","simultaneous occlusions","both extracranial and intracranial arteries","a particularly challenging subset","large vessel occlusion","LVO strokes","most TLs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Endovascular management":2.0,"tandem embolic stroke":2.0,"BackgroundTandem lesions":1.0,"TLs":1.0,"simultaneous occlusions":1.0,"both extracranial and intracranial arteries":1.0,"a particularly challenging subset":1.0,"large vessel occlusion":1.0,"LVO strokes":1.0,"most TLs":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7541619866666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2765,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8553,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6805,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.087,"sadness":0.1064,"fear":0.0768,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.031},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a case study of a specific medical procedure.

{"id":"science_frontiers_neuroscience_c3527cf4f24e","title":"Brainstem neurochemical profiles after hospitalisation for COVID","content":"BackgroundSomatic, cognitive and mental health issues have been identified in three-quarters of people 5 months after hospitalisation for severe acute SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. The underlying neuroanatomical basis of these symptoms remains unclear, but recent studies suggest a role for altered brainstem physiology. We aimed to test the hypothesis that brainstem neurochemical profiles differ in patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19 compared to matched controls using 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).MethodsThis prospective case–control study recruited 34 individuals who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 15 healthy controls with no history of COVID-19 infection from two major UK hospitals before vaccines became available. The participants underwent 7T semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) 1H-MRS at the ponto-medullary junction. Water-referenced metabolite concentrations were compared between the patients and controls and correlated with infection severity, as measured by maximum C-reactive protein (CRPmax) assay during inpatient admission. Linear mixed modelling was used with a 0.05 significance level.ResultsSpectral quality was high/acceptable in 44/49 participants according to the MRS Consensus criteria. The magnitude of inflammation during patient admission (i.e., CRPmax) correlated positively with myo-inositol concentration (β = 0.005, p = 0.035), as did patient-reported symptoms (β = −0.564, p = 0.023). However, metabolite concentrations were not significantly different between the patients and controls.ConclusionWe show the feasibility of assessing brainstem neurochemical profiles using 7T 1H-MRS in a multi-centre study. Technical limitations at one site’s 7T MRI led to variable repetition times, which limited our statistical power and should be avoided in future studies.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_eb538199909c","title":"Clarifying the reliability paradox: poor measurement reliability attenuates group differences","content":"Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups.

Registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023446068). Thirty-four quasi-experimental studies meeting ≥60% MMAT quality were included (assessed using the MMAT) were included. Data extraction considered demographic variables, mental health outcomes, types of psychotropic drugs, and prescription status.ResultsThe findings reveal a significant association between both prescribed and non-prescribed psychotropic drug use and symptoms of psychological distress. Non-prescribed use was more strongly linked to anxiety, stress, and depression, whereas prescribed use was more closely related to suicidal ideation and suicide. Antidepressants, anxiolytics, and opioids were most frequently involved. Women and, in several studies, LGBTQ+ students displayed higher prevalence of psychotropic use in relation to distress.ConclusionThe results emphasize the need for a preventive, contextual, and integral approach to address psychotropic drug use in university settings. Healthy Campus initiatives should reinforce awareness campaigns, promote psychosocial well-being, ensure early detection of psychological distress, and reflect critically on academic structures that may exacerbate emotional difficulties. Further research is needed from an intersectional and multilevel perspective to inform targeted interventions and institutional policy.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42023446068, identifier (CRD42023446068).","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1661844","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.011340","language":"en","tags":["systematic_review","frontiers","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":235,"author":"Víctor José Villanueva-Blasco","raw_content_length":1970,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.175,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PsyInfo","PubMed/MEDLINE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1970,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Systematic review","the use","prescription","psychotropic drugs","BackgroundThis systematic review","the relationship","prescribed and non-prescribed use","the presence","symptoms","depression"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Systematic review":2.0,"the use":2.0,"prescription":2.0,"psychotropic drugs":2.0,"BackgroundThis systematic review":1.0,"the relationship":1.0,"prescribed and non-prescribed use":1.0,"the presence":1.0,"symptoms":1.0,"depression":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754331061944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.26849999999999985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9463,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2169,"joy":0.0083,"surprise":0.013,"sadness":0.1227,"fear":0.6157,"anger":0.0098,"disgust":0.0136},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This systematic review analyzes the relationship between psychotropic drug use and mental health in university students.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_4da82efbf437","title":"Court","content":"This study focuses on the process of Court-Appointed Expert Consultation (Consulenza Tecnica d’Ufficio, CTU) that parents involved in high-conflict separations must undergo. The CTU is an expert psychological assessment commissioned by the court to assist legal proceedings, aimed at providing judges with essential information for well-founded decisions. Given that this is a relatively new but rapidly growing field in Italy, also considering the increasing divorce rates, specific scientific literature on the subject is still limited. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine in greater depth how separated parents perceive and experience this process, considering the psychological aspects involved, their expectations, their evaluation of the investigation’s utility, and the motivations underlying their request. Through qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews, the results highlight that participants view the CTU as a useful decision-making tool for the judge, but also as a mediator and guardian of minors. However, parents often confuse the role of the CTU with that of a mediator. Many parents expect a “corrective” CTU for the other parent, based on the idea that the problem lies with the other party. Indeed, while the request primarily arises to protect the children, it is also aimed at countering the other parent. Parents described the process as a demanding but ultimately useful, offering opportunities for reflection and new insights. The CTU is ultimately seen as a “validation” of parental suitability and a tool for vindication, but also as not always resolving family conflicts. We believe these findings can be highly useful for the Courts that initiate the investigation, as well as for all professionals involved, including psychologists, lawyers, and juvenile judges.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1668693","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.012083","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","original_research","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":270,"author":"Tania Fiorini","raw_content_length":1827,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.35,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Court-Appointed Expert Consultation","Consulenza Tecnica d’Ufficio"],"persons":[],"locations":["Italy"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1827,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Court","This study","the process","Court-Appointed Expert Consultation","Consulenza Tecnica dUfficio","parents","high-conflict separations","The CTU","an expert psychological assessment","the court"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Court":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the process":1.0,"Court-Appointed Expert Consultation":1.0,"Consulenza Tecnica dUfficio":1.0,"parents":1.0,"high-conflict separations":1.0,"The CTU":1.0,"an expert psychological assessment":1.0,"the court":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754360625,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8149,"joy":0.0184,"surprise":0.0273,"sadness":0.0211,"fear":0.0745,"anger":0.0159,"disgust":0.028},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study examines the psychological aspects of court-appointed expert consultations in high-conflict separations.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_5ed10139530e","title":"The influence of moral reasoning on adolescent decision","content":"IntroductionMoral reasoning is a key component of moral development, yet its role in regulating stress during high-pressure social conflicts in adolescents is underexplored. This study investigated the influence of moral reasoning ability on decision-making and stress responses in Chinese adolescents during a simulated social-moral conflict.MethodsChinese adolescents (N = 118, 14–17 years) were grouped into high and low moral reasoning ability based on their Defining Issues Test-2 (DIT-2) scores. In a counterbalanced design, they were exposed to a high-pressure social-moral conflict scenario in immersive virtual reality (VR) and a neutral control condition. We measured physiological stress (heart rate), psychological stress (state anxiety), and moral decision-making (accuracy, speed).ResultsThe VR scenario successfully induced greater physiological arousal (higher heart rate) and state anxiety compared to the control condition. However, the level of moral reasoning ability had no significant effect on moral decision-making accuracy or state anxiety. A non-significant trend suggested that high-reasoning participants exhibited slightly lower average heart rates during the VR conflict, hinting at a potential stress-buffering effect.DiscussionThe findings indicate that the practical application of moral reasoning in adolescents is strongly moderated by situational pressures and developmental factors. While higher moral reasoning may not buffer against acute stress or improve immediate decision-making in intense social conflicts, this study highlights the value of VR for examining moral behavior in ecologically valid contexts. Future research with larger samples is needed to verify the potential stress-buffering trend.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1661490","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.012447","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","original_research","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Tingting Zhang","raw_content_length":1743,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1743,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The influence","moral reasoning","adolescent decision","IntroductionMoral reasoning","a key component","moral development","its role","stress","high-pressure social conflicts","adolescents"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["moral development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The influence":2.0,"moral reasoning":2.0,"adolescent decision":2.0,"IntroductionMoral reasoning":1.0,"a key component":1.0,"moral development":1.0,"its role":1.0,"stress":1.0,"high-pressure social conflicts":1.0,"adolescents":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7543751274999995,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.5460000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6908,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8083,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0205,"sadness":0.0191,"fear":0.0392,"anger":0.0393,"disgust":0.0677},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into moral reasoning and decision-making under stress using VR.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_dd30b0a17694","title":"Differential associations between mentalizing dimensions and psychopathy subtypes: the moderating role of borderline personality traits","content":"IntroductionPsychopathy comprises primary and secondary subtypes with distinct affective–interpersonal profiles. Mentalizing, i.e., the capacity to understand one’s own and others’ mental states, may help explain this heterogeneity. This study tested how three mentalizing dimensions (Self-Related, Other-Related, and Motivation to Mentalize) relate to psychopathy subtypes and whether borderline personality traits (BPTs) moderate these associations.MethodsAdults from a community sample (N = 953) completed validated measures of psychopathy, mentalizing, and BPTs. BPTs were modeled as a continuous variable. Multivariable linear regressions predicted primary and secondary psychopathy from the three mentalizing facets while adjusting for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and psychiatric diagnosis. Moderation was examined via interaction terms between each mentalizing facet and BPTs; significant interactions were probed at −1/0/+1 SD of BPT scores.ResultsHigher Motivation to Mentalize and greater Self-Related Mentalizing were uniquely associated with lower primary psychopathy; Other-Related Mentalizing was not a unique predictor. For secondary psychopathy, Self-Related Mentalizing and, to a lesser extent, Motivation to Mentalize were inversely associated; Other-Related Mentalizing was not significant. BPTs significantly moderated only the association between Motivation to Mentalize and primary psychopathy (stronger inverse association at higher BPTs); no moderation effects emerged for secondary psychopathy.ConclusionFindings indicate that motivation and self-related aspects of mentalizing are protective correlates of psychopathic traits, with moderation by BPTs limited to primary psychopathy. Targeting motivation to consider mental states and strengthening self-reflective capacity may enhance psychological intervention strategies, particularly for individuals high in primary psychopathy with elevated borderline features.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1685417","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.012842","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","original_research","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Buket Ünver","raw_content_length":1948,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BPTs","IntroductionPsychopathy","Motivation"],"persons":["BPTs"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1948,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["psychopathy subtypes","borderline personality traits","Differential associations","mentalizing dimensions","the moderating role","IntroductionPsychopathy","primary and secondary subtypes","distinct affectiveinterpersonal profiles","Mentalizing","the capacity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["borderline personality traits"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"psychopathy subtypes":3.0,"borderline personality traits":3.0,"Differential associations":2.0,"mentalizing dimensions":2.0,"the moderating role":2.0,"IntroductionPsychopathy":1.0,"primary and secondary subtypes":1.0,"distinct affectiveinterpersonal profiles":1.0,"Mentalizing":1.0,"the capacity":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754390328055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6249,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8865,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0209,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0246,"anger":0.0129,"disgust":0.0345},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on mentalizing and psychopathy, with potential implications for psychological interventions.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_f3f3677bdcd8","title":"Impact mechanism of inclusive leadership on employees’ workplace wellbeing in service enterprises: a chain mediation model of relational identification and job embeddedness","content":"In service enterprises, employees’ workplace wellbeing is not only crucial for individual performance and mental health, but also directly affects organizational stability and customer satisfaction. Drawing on social identity theory (SIT), this study constructs and tests a chain mediation model in which inclusive leadership influences employees’ workplace wellbeing through relational identification and job embeddedness. Based on a questionnaire survey of 386 frontline employees in service enterprises in South China, the study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrapping analysis. The results show that: (1) inclusive leadership has a significant positive effect on employees’ workplace wellbeing; (2) relational identification and job embeddedness do not exert significant mediation effects when considered independently; (3) relational identification enhances workplace wellbeing significantly through increased job embeddedness, forming a valid chain mediation path; and (4) gender plays a moderating role in some paths, with male employees relying more on structural embeddedness for wellbeing and female employees being more influenced by emotional identification. This study reveals the underlying psychological mechanism by which inclusive leadership enhances workplace wellbeing, enriching the literature on leadership and employee psychological wellbeing, and providing practical guidance for optimizing employee management strategies in service enterprises.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1679002","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.013197","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","original_research","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Zhuquan Yang","raw_content_length":1489,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SIT"],"persons":[],"locations":["South China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1489,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["employees workplace","service enterprises","a chain mediation model","relational identification","job embeddedness","Impact mechanism","inclusive leadership","individual performance","mental health","organizational stability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a chain mediation model"],"engineering":["job embeddedness"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"employees workplace":3.0,"service enterprises":3.0,"a chain mediation model":3.0,"relational identification":3.0,"job embeddedness":3.0,"Impact mechanism":2.0,"inclusive leadership":2.0,"individual performance":1.0,"mental health":1.0,"organizational stability":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754404827222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.9635,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5927,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6148,"joy":0.1779,"surprise":0.0324,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.0827,"anger":0.0365,"disgust":0.0424},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the impact of inclusive leadership on employee wellbeing, which indirectly affects organizational stability and customer satisfaction.

To reduce questionable research practices and improve the credibility of research findings, researchers preregister important details before commencing with data collection. However, current preregistration practices miss an important issue when it comes to evaluating predictions. That is because predictions depend not only on theoretical terms but also auxiliary assumptions. Auxiliary assumptions traverse the distance from nonobservational theoretical terms to observational terms at the level of the empirical hypotheses. Because the credibility of study findings depends on the appraisal of auxiliary assumptions, these assumptions should, at least, be considered in preregistration practices. In this paper we outline the need to consider auxiliary assumptions during preregistration, the benefits of doing so, and how current practices can be amended to accommodate them. If the need for researchers to preregister continues to increase and the belief is that doing so will increase the credibility of psychological research, we believe auxiliary assumptions should become part of these practices.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1633990","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.013531","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","open-access","perspective","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"David Trafimow","raw_content_length":1182,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1182,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The need","auxiliary assumptions","preregistration practices","predictions","The importance","preregistration","recent traction","psychology","questionable research practices","the credibility"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["questionable research practices"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The need":2.0,"auxiliary assumptions":2.0,"preregistration practices":2.0,"predictions":2.0,"The importance":1.0,"preregistration":1.0,"recent traction":1.0,"psychology":1.0,"questionable research practices":1.0,"the credibility":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754417964444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9181,"joy":0.0028,"surprise":0.0061,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0148,"anger":0.0185,"disgust":0.0329},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article discusses improving research practices in psychology by considering auxiliary assumptions in preregistration.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_40a2efb1d558","title":"Turning on the we","content":"Collective pro-environmental engagement of communities is vital for addressing climate change through system-wide transformations. To promote such engagement, individuals must go beyond their immediate personal interests, requiring activation and promotion of pro-social behaviors. In this review we aimed to explore joint action as a way to “boost” collective action approaches beyond specific frontrunner groups. In recent years, joint action (i.e., social interaction whereby individuals coordinate their actions to bring about a change in the environment.) has received significant attention as an approach that can bring about various pro-social behaviors. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify the pro-social outcomes associated with joint action and discuss its potential to promote collective pro-environmental engagement. Our analysis revealed two types of pro-social behaviors: those related to group functioning (togetherness, perspective taking, and cooperative behavior) and those tied to group performance (commitment, agency). These behaviors can be effectively promoted by joint action, as witnessed by medium to large effect sizes. We therefore argue that these findings offer a promising pathway for leveraging joint action as a means to enhance collective pro-environmental engagement across a broad segment of the population, and ultimately provide effective climate governance strategies.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1642312","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.013908","language":"en","tags":["systematic_review","frontiers","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Denise de Ridder","raw_content_length":1427,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Collective"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1427,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the we","individuals","Collective pro-environmental engagement","communities","climate change","system-wide transformations","such engagement","their immediate personal interests","activation","promotion"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the we":2.0,"individuals":2.0,"Collective pro-environmental engagement":1.0,"communities":1.0,"climate change":1.0,"system-wide transformations":1.0,"such engagement":1.0,"their immediate personal interests":1.0,"activation":1.0,"promotion":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754432229444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.4785,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8957,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8258,"joy":0.0403,"surprise":0.0209,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0198,"anger":0.0415,"disgust":0.0442},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses a systematic literature review on joint action and its potential to promote collective pro-environmental engagement.

The aim of this pilot study was to compare executive function skills in preschool boys who participated in football training and those who undertook martial arts training. The participants were sixty (60) typically developing 5–6-year-old boys from large Russian cities. There were two groups with 30 boys in each group: a football group and a martial arts group. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) male gender; (b) boys did not attend any extracurricular activities other than their football training or martial arts training; (c) the duration of football or martial arts training session was more than 30 min; (d) boys attended these trainings for at least 6 months and no more than 2 years. Caregivers reported on the specifics of child’s attendance at sports training and child’s age, maternal education, and family income, which were used as control variables. The results indicated that boys involved in football training had significantly higher spatial component of visuospatial working memory compared to boys involved in martial arts training. Taken together, these findings suggest that football training compared to martial arts training in 5–6-year-old boys may have more potential in terms of developing spatial component of visuospatial working memory.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_4b3e44ec83f1","title":"Becoming a teacher can reduce obedience compared to being solely an examiner. Agentic state and obedience in the Milgram paradigm","content":"Studies of obedience carried out in the Milgram paradigm tend to report shockingly high levels of obedience from people who are ordered by an authority figure to eventually, if administer all required shocks, electrocute another person. In the psychology literature, the person who carries out these commands is called the teacher. The authors of the present article note, however, that the term “examiner” would be more appropriate here, since the study participant is limited to verifying the correctness of the responses given by the student, i.e., the person sitting behind the wall. It was assumed that if the participant actually performed the role of a teacher (and thus first taught the “student,” and only then checked the correctness of the answers to questions), the level of obedience demonstrated would be reduced. The results of our experiment partially confirmed this assumption. In the examiner condition, 4 out of 40 participants (10%) refused to press all ten switches, meaning that 90% proceeded to 150 V. In the conditions where participants had first taught the student, refusals occurred more than twice as often: 9 out of 40 (22.5%), with 77.5% reaching 150 V. This difference, however, was not statistically significant. We also analyzed an indirect measure of non-compliance—the frequency with which the experimenter had to prompt participants to continue by reciting the standardized phrases prescribed by the procedure whenever participants expressed hesitation or refused to comply. These experimenter interventions were more frequent in the conditions where participants had previously taught the learner (Median = 0.5) than in the examiner condition, where their role was limited to punishing learner for his mistakes (Median = 0).

Thirty-nine male basketball players were assigned to a free-throw clinic with either a caring, task-involving (CTI) climate, where high effort and improvement are valued and recognized and mistakes are part of learning or an ego-involving (EI) climate, where winning is prioritized, athletes are punished for mistakes, and star players are favored. Participants completed pre- and post-clinic surveys. Video analysis allowed for the assessment of free-throw kinematics (e.g., knee flexion) pre- and post-clinic.ResultsNo baseline group differences were found. At post-assessment, the CTI group’s shooting kinematics more closely resembled those of proficient shooters compared to the EI group.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_4d18a2d07c4f","title":"When emotion meets reason: the development and validation of EpiCT","content":"IntroductionEpistemic emotion is a significant concept in education, but traditional scales rarely focus on the status of epistemic emotions in intercultural issues. Additionally, cultural identity and critical thinking are vital in navigating the complexities inherent in intercultural contexts. Existing measures of critical thinking and cultural identity seldom consider the influence of emotions. The EpiCT-CI Scale, developed in this research, seeks to bridge this gap by measuring how epistemic emotions influence critical thinking and cultural identity in intercultural settings.MethodDeveloping and validating the EpiCT-CI Scale combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Study 1 collected data from students’ comments, judgments, and narrations about critical thinking during COVID-19. Study 2 focused on the emotional experiences of constructing cultural identity by reading, analyzing, and writing about cultural issues. The data from Studies 1 and 2 are analyzed in NVivo 15.0. The original EpiCT-CI Scale is validated through SPSS 20.0 and Amos 29.0 in Study 3.ResultsThe results from Studies 1 and 2 indicate that epistemic emotions are a blend of neutral, positive, and negative states, rather than simple linear progressions. The initial 52-item scale underwent a thorough evaluation, modification, and validation process in Study 3, resulting in a four-dimensional 19-item EpiCT-CI Scale, which represents four groups of epistemic emotions: joy in critical cultural inquiry, boredom in critical cultural reflection, curiosity in cultural identity reflection, and distress in cultural adaptation. The EpiCT-CI Scale provides an effective tool for assessing epistemic emotions in cultural identity constructions and critical thinking applications.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1687003","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:36.016795","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","original_research","open-access","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Yue Peng","raw_content_length":1766,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The EpiCT-CI Scale","COVID-19","the EpiCT-CI Scale"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1766,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["emotion","reason","the development","validation","EpiCT","cultural identity","critical thinking","IntroductionEpistemic emotion","a significant concept","education"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["the development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"emotion":2.0,"reason":2.0,"the development":2.0,"validation":2.0,"EpiCT":2.0,"cultural identity":2.0,"critical thinking":2.0,"IntroductionEpistemic emotion":1.0,"a significant concept":1.0,"education":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754551684722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8906,"joy":0.0128,"surprise":0.0238,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.028,"anger":0.0216,"disgust":0.0185},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes the development and validation of a scale to measure epistemic emotions in intercultural settings.

{"id":"science_frontiers_robotics_ai_b9fa0ca384b0","title":"Development and control of a robotic assistant walking aid for fall risk reduction","content":"Falls are a major risk factor among the elderly, often resulting in injuries that compromise independence and quality of life. Conventional walking aids lack active stabilization capabilities and are therefore limited in effectively preventing balance-related accidents. This paper presents the design and control of a smart robotic assistant aimed at reducing fall risk in elderly users by providing real-time balance support. The proposed system uses a wearable inertial measurement unit to detect postural imbalances in the sagittal (front-back) and frontal (side-to-side) planes. When instability is detected, the robotic arm generates compensatory forces or torques through linear or rotational actuators to help the user regain a stable posture. Using a cascaded control architecture, the outer loop is designed to maintain the user’s upright posture, while the inner loop ensures fast and accurate actuator performance. To enable effective and reliable control in the real system, actuator dynamics are characterized through an optimization-based system identification approach, resulting in transfer function models with over 98% accuracy. Based on these models, PID controllers are optimally tuned using an optimization algorithm to ensure fast and accurate corrective action. The system effectively returns the user to a stable position within 2.3 ± 0.3 s for linear actuation (with a response time of 120 ± 10 ms) and 2.2 ± 0.2 s for rotary actuation (with a response time of 140 ± 15 ms), providing safe posture return during imbalance events. To further enhance safety, an automatic braking mechanism immobilizes the walking aid during corrective maneuvers. Experimental validation demonstrates the system’s effectiveness in detecting and correcting postural imbalances in both the sagittal and frontal planes under dynamic conditions. These results highlight the potential for enhancing mobility, safety, and therapeutic support for older adults, contributing to the advancement of assistive fall-prevention technologies.","source":"science_frontiers_robotics_ai","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1646803","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:38.369285","language":"en","tags":["robotics","original_research","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":293,"author":"Yeongmi Kim","raw_content_length":2035,"priority":8,"update_frequency":168,"reading_time_minutes":1.465,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Falls"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2035,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["control","Development","a robotic assistant walking aid","fall risk reduction","Falls","a major risk factor","injuries","independence","quality","life"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["control","Development"],"ai_ml":["a robotic assistant walking aid"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"control":3.0,"Development":2.0,"a robotic assistant walking aid":2.0,"fall risk reduction":2.0,"Falls":1.0,"a major risk factor":1.0,"injuries":1.0,"independence":1.0,"quality":1.0,"life":1.0}},"age_hours":6.754581341944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.751,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0498,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6168,"joy":0.0092,"surprise":0.0076,"sadness":0.0175,"fear":0.3004,"anger":0.0237,"disgust":0.0247},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents the design and control of a robotic assistant for fall risk reduction.

This research aims to understand the effects of ownership structure on debt levels and the efficiency of companies in the electricity sector. The efficiency of electricity companies can help reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The analysis covers 7777 observations of 38 companies from 1996 to 2023, including all publicly traded electricity companies on the Brazilian stock exchange (B3). The method is based on a panel data regression model with statistical tests to support the results. The results were robust and significant. Regarding efficiency, ownership structure revealed a negative relationship (−0.107); however, as company capital becomes more dispersed, it ceases to influence company efficiency. In terms of debt levels, the relationship was positive (0.095) and, despite the dispersion of capital among the five largest common shareholders (0.103), continues to exert influence. This research contributes to the scientific literature by confirming relationships and providing evidence between new and previously unexplored variables specific to the electricity sector. It is expected to create a benchmark for future analyses, highlighting the importance of ownership structure in the performance of electricity sector companies, which can contribute to improving the management of these companies, making them more competitive and sustainable.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9120","published_date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:41.062852","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Adriano Mendonça Souza","raw_content_length":1541,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Debt Level and Efficiency of Electricity Companies Corporate"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1531,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Influence","Ownership Structure","the Debt Level","Efficiency","Electricity Companies","Corporate ownership structure","a complementary indicator","corporate performance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Influence":2.0,"Ownership Structure":2.0,"the Debt Level":2.0,"Efficiency":2.0,"Electricity Companies":2.0,"Corporate ownership structure":1.0,"a complementary indicator":1.0,"corporate performance":1.0}},"age_hours":6.755366906111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8887,"joy":0.018,"surprise":0.0222,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.0097,"anger":0.0219,"disgust":0.0272},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the impact of ownership structure on the efficiency and debt levels of electricity companies in Brazil.

Educators’ understanding of food sustainability influences how effectively it is integrated into educational programs. This study examined the knowledge and understanding of food sustainability among nutrition and agri-food educators in Europe as part of a joint European-funded project (2023-1-IE01-KA220-VET-00156916: Train to Sustain). After ethical approval, a survey was distributed to educators in Ireland, Slovenia, Poland, and Italy. Data were analysed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Of the 123 educators who participated, 81% agreed they fully understood “food sustainability,” and 97% believed it is important to include it in education, yet only 62% reported that it was currently taught in their programs. This reveals a gap between perceived importance and implementation. The data also offered insights into how educators understand food sustainability across environmental, economic, social, cultural, and food security dimensions and how these are incorporated into teaching and awareness raising. Three themes were identified: (1) understanding sustainable food systems, (2) sustainable resource management, and (3) educating for food security and resilience. Participants emphasised environmentally friendly food practices, often linked to zero waste goals. The qualitative findings underscored the importance of societal access to healthy food, focusing on food security. However, references to economic and cultural aspects of sustainability were limited, suggesting a potential gap in educators’ understanding.

We consider the off-diagonal components, including lh, hl, as well as part of the resonant block hh -> l for |xi + eta| >= N^(1-delta). The proof relies on three main elements: (i) six-fold integration by parts in the phase Phi(t,x,xi,eta) = x*(xi + eta) + 4trho1rho2 with respect to (t,rho1,rho2); on the window |t| <= N^(-1/2) the phase Hessian A = nabla^2_(t,rho1,rho2) Phi is non-degenerate and provides a reserve |det A| ~ N^(3/2 - delta); (ii) local Strichartz estimates on cylinders of scale N^(-1/2); in Sec. 4 a strengthened version is used to combine with the decoupling scheme, while the unconditional framework is based on heat reduction (App. D) and globalization (App. E); and (iii) bilinear epsilon-free decoupling in folded geometry of rank 4 (Appendix B), yielding a gain of N^(-1/4) for angular tiles of width N^(-1/2). For the narrow corona, suppression of the null-form type symbol is realized when delta > 1/2; for the block hh -> h with output projection P_N this mechanism is not required and is accounted for separately (see App. E.6). The combined count yields an a priori estimate without logarithmic losses in the norm L^1_t H^-1_x over the whole zone |xi + eta| >= N^(1 - delta) for delta in (1/3, 5/8]; the upper bound is imposed by the stability of the phase reserve |det A| ~ N^(3/2 - delta) >> 1 on the window |t| <= N^(-1/2).

The classical form is played with two piles of stones, from which two players take turns to remove stones from one or both piles. When removing stones from both piles, an equal number must be removed from each. The player who removes the last stone or stones is the winner. Equivalently, we consider a single chess queen placed somewhere on a large grid of squares. Each player can move the queen toward the upper-left corner of the grid, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, in any number of steps. The winner is the player who moves the queen into the upper-left corner, the position (0,0) in our coordinate system. We call (0,0) the terminal position of Wythoff's game. In our variant of Wythoff's game, we have a set of positions {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(0,2)} as the terminal set. If a player moves the queen into this terminal set, that player is the winner of the game. The P-positions of this variant are described by the P-positions of Wythoff's game and Hofstadter's G-Sequence. This variant has two remarkable properties. For a position (x,y) with x >= 8 or y >= 8, the Grundy number of the position (x,y) is 1 in this variant if and only if (x,y) is a P-position of Wythoff's game.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_db5e0da9e504","title":"Learning interpretable closures for thermal radiation transport in optically","content":"arXiv:2510.11840v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce an equation learning framework to identify a closed set of equations for moment quantities in 1D thermal radiation transport (TRT) in optically thin media. While optically thick media admits a well-known diffusive closure, the utility of moment closures in providing accurate low-dimensional surrogates for TRT in optically thin media is unclear, as the mean-free path of photons is large and the radiation flux is far from its Fickean limit. Here, we demonstrate the viability of using weak-form equation learning to close the system of equations for the energy density, radiation flux, and temperature in optically thin TRT. We show that the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), together with an advantageous change of variables and an auxiliary equation for the radiation-energy-weighted opacity, enables robust and efficient identification of closures that preserve many desired physical properties from the high fidelity system, including hyperbolicity, rotational symmetry, black-body equilibria, and linear stability of black-body equilibria, all of which manifest as library constraints or convex constraints on the closure coefficients. Crucially, the weak form enables closures to be learned from simulation data with ray effects and particle noise, which then do not appear in simulations of the resulting closed moment system. Finally, we demonstrate that our closure models can be extrapolated in the key system parameters of drive temperature $T_{in}$ and scalar opacity $\\gamma$, and this extrapolation is to an extent quantifiable by a Knudsen-like dimensionless parameter.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11840","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:02.994643","language":"en","tags":["mathds","preprints","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Daniel Messenger, Ben Southworth, Hans Hammer, Luis Chacon","raw_content_length":1688,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TRT","Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics","the WSINDy algorithm"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1687,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["interpretable closures","thermal radiation transport","TRT","optically thin media","arXiv251011840v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","an equation learning framework","a closed set","equations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"interpretable closures":2.0,"thermal radiation transport":2.0,"TRT":2.0,"optically thin media":2.0,"arXiv251011840v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"an equation learning framework":1.0,"a closed set":1.0,"equations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7577562091666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.864,"joy":0.026,"surprise":0.0555,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.0203,"anger":0.0193,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel equation learning framework for thermal radiation transport in optically thin media.

The theory of webs developed organically for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \\geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$. This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12035","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.010656","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathematics","mathco","research","mathrt","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Heather M.

The aim is to solve the non-monotone VI problem without assuming the existence of a Minty-type solution. We first introduce and study various error bound conditions for the gap functions in relation to the VI model. In particular, we show that uniform type error bounds imply level-set type error bounds for composite optimization, revealing a key hierarchical structure there. As a result, local linear convergence is established under some easy-verifiable conditions induced by level-set error bounds, the gradient Lipschitz condition and a suitable initialization condition. Furthermore, for non-monotone affine VIs we present a homotopy continuation scheme that achieves global convergence by dynamically tracing a solution path. Our numerical experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach, leading to the solutions of a broad class of non-monotone VI problems resulting from the need to compute Nash equilibria, traffic controls, and the GAN models.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12105","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.015377","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathoc","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Lei Zhao, Daoli Zhu, Shuzhong Zhang","raw_content_length":1231,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Lipschitz"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1230,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["New Classes","Non","arXiv251012105v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","this paper","the local linear convergence behavior","proximal-gradient PG descent algorithm","a parameterized gap-function reformulation","VIP","The aim"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["proximal-gradient PG descent algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"New Classes":2.0,"Non":2.0,"arXiv251012105v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"the local linear convergence behavior":1.0,"proximal-gradient PG descent algorithm":1.0,"a parameterized gap-function reformulation":1.0,"VIP":1.0,"The aim":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7584436013888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.064,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8232,"joy":0.0412,"surprise":0.0359,"sadness":0.0088,"fear":0.0258,"anger":0.0422,"disgust":0.0229},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for solving variational inequality problems, which can be applied to various fields including traffic control and GAN models.
