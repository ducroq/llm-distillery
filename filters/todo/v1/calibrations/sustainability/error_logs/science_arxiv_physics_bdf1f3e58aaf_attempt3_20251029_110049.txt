  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion heating using Alfv\'en waves, a phenomenon relevant to plasma environments. While the research identifies a stochastic heating rate (Q), it remains at the theoretical stage with no deployed technology or measurable outcomes in terms of GHG emission reduction or climate adaptation. The research is peer-reviewed, lending credibility to the findings, but it's far from commercial viability or deployment readiness.",
