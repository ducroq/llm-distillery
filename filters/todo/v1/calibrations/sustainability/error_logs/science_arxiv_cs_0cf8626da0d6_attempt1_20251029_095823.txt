  "reasoning": "This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent for Cox neural networks, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by enabling faster and more efficient training of models used in climate-related research. The paper establishes consistency and convergence rates for the mini-batch maximum partial-likelihood estimator (mb-MPLE) and provides practical guidance on using SGD, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical evidence, but it's still in the basic research phase.",
