  "reasoning": "The article presents a novel framework (SecPE) for privacy-preserving synthetic text generation. It shows improved utility-privacy trade-offs and reduced computational complexity compared to baselines, measured by lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy. However, it is still in the applied research stage with no real-world deployment data, hence the low deployment readiness and climate impact potential scores.",
