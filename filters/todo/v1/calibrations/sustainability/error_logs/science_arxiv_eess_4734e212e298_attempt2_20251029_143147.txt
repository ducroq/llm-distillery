  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study on coordinated beamforming for networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While it derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and proposes algorithms, it remains at the research stage with no deployed technology or measured outcomes. The potential climate impact is indirect, related to optimizing wireless systems, but not directly reducing emissions.",
