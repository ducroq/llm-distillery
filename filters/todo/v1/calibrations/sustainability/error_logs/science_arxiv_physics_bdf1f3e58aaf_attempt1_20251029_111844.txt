  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a phenomenon relevant to plasma environments. While the research provides a formula for the stochastic heating rate (Q), it is currently at the basic research stage with no deployed technology or measured outcomes in a sustainability context. The economic viability and deployment readiness are low as it is a theoretical study.",
