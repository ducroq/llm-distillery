  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical formalism for giant Goos-H\"anchen shift, a promising effect for highly sensitive sensors. While the theoretical description is confirmed numerically, it remains at the basic research stage with no deployed sensors or real-world data. The potential climate impact is indirect, relying on future applications of these sensors in environmental monitoring or other climate-related fields.",
