  "reasoning": "This article focuses on the theoretical convergence rate of stochastic gradient descent algorithms, which are used in machine learning. While machine learning can be applied to various sustainability problems, this research is at a very early stage and doesn't have direct, measurable outcomes in terms of GHG reduction or other sustainability metrics. The technical credibility is high due to the mathematical nature of the work, but deployment readiness is low.",
