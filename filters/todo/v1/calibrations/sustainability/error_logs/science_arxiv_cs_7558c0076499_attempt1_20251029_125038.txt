  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework (Thermodynamic Coordination Theory) that could potentially inform the design of more efficient and less energy-intensive coordination mechanisms in various systems, including those relevant to sustainability (e.g., smart grids, supply chains). The paper derives a scaling law for the minimum description length of coordination protocols, which implies that coordination requires information loss and simplification. While the research is theoretical and does not involve deployed technology, it provides measurable signatures across systems.",
