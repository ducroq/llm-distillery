  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study on coordinated beamforming for networked ISAC systems. While it derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and proposes algorithms, it lacks concrete deployment or measured outcomes. The research is at an early stage, focusing on signal models and optimization problems rather than real-world implementation.",
