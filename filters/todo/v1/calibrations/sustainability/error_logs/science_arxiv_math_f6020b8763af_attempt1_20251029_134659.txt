  "reasoning": "This article presents theoretical research on an inverse problem for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. While the techniques developed could potentially be applied to a wide range of inverse problems for nonlinear equations, there are no concrete actions or measurable outcomes related to sustainability at this stage. The research is at a very early stage and lacks any connection to real-world deployment or economic viability.",
