  "reasoning": "This article presents theoretical mathematical research on inverse problems for nonlinear PDEs. While the techniques developed could potentially be applied to a wide range of inverse problems, including those related to climate modeling or resource management, there are no concrete actions or measurable outcomes directly related to sustainability at this stage. The research is at a very early stage and does not involve any deployed technology or real-world data.",
