  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical model and simulation results for ion heating by Alfv\'en waves. While it identifies a stochastic heating rate (Q) and relates it to wave conditions, it remains at the basic research stage with no deployed technology or real-world validation. The potential climate impact is indirect, as it could potentially improve plasma confinement in fusion reactors, but this is highly speculative and far from deployment.",
