  "reasoning": "The article presents a novel federated learning framework (\our) that reduces memory usage and accelerates training, potentially enabling wider adoption of AI in resource-constrained environments. The claims are supported by experimental results showing performance improvements, memory reduction, and training acceleration. However, it is still in the research and development phase with no real-world deployment data.",
