  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves. While the research identifies a quantifiable stochastic heating rate (Q), it remains at the theoretical stage with no deployed technology or measured outcomes in a real-world setting. The economic viability and deployment readiness are low due to the early stage of development.",
