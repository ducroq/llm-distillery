  "reasoning": "This article presents theoretical improvements to the simplex method, a linear programming algorithm. While linear programming has broad applications, including optimizing resource allocation in sustainable systems, this research is at a very early stage and has no direct, measurable impact on sustainability currently. The technical credibility is high due to peer-reviewed research, but deployment readiness and economic viability are low.",
