  "reasoning": "This article describes a theoretical formalism for giant Goos-Hänchen shift for highly sensitive sensors. While it shows a potential improvement in sensitivity by more than one thousand compared to theoretical values, it is still in the theoretical stage and lacks deployment or real-world validation. The impact on climate change is indirect, through potentially enabling better sensors for environmental monitoring, but is not directly quantified.",
