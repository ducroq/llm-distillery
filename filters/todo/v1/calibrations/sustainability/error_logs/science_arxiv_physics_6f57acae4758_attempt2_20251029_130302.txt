  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for highly sensitive sensors using the Goos-H\"anchen shift, with potential applications in environmental monitoring. The concrete action is the development of a formalism and numerical confirmation, but it remains at the theoretical stage with no deployed sensors or real-world data. The key evidence is the analytical description and numerical confirmation, but deployment readiness is low.",
