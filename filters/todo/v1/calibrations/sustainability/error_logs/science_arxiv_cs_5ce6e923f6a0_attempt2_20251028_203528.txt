  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel sharpness measure (R\'enyi sharpness) for neural networks and demonstrates a strong correlation with generalization performance. The research includes generalization bounds and experimental results showing a test accuracy gain of nearly 2.5% compared to classical methods. While promising, this is currently at the research stage and requires further development to translate into concrete climate action.",
