  "reasoning": "This article presents a novel method for robot throwing, which could potentially improve logistics operations. The concrete action is the development and testing of a throwing algorithm on a real robot, achieving pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold. However, it is still in the research stage with no clear path to economic viability or large-scale deployment, and the climate impact is indirect and theoretical.",
