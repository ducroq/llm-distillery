  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework for generating synthetic text data with differential privacy, aiming to reduce computational complexity and utility loss compared to existing methods. The concrete action is the development of the SecPE framework, and the evidence supporting the claims is empirical results on OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, showing lower FID and higher downstream task accuracy. The innovation is at the applied research stage, with no indication of real-world deployment.",
