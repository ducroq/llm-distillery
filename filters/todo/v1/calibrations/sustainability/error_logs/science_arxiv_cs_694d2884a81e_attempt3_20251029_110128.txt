  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation. The concrete action is the development and benchmarking of this framework against existing methods. Evidence comes from empirical results on OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, showing lower FID and higher downstream task accuracy compared to baselines, indicating potential for reduced computational overhead. It is currently in an applied research stage, with no deployed units or customer contracts.",
