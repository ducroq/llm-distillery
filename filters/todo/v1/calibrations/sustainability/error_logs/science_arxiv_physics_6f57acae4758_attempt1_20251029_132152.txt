  "reasoning": "This article presents a theoretical framework and numerical confirmation for enhancing the sensitivity of Goos-H\"anchen shift-based sensors. The concrete action is the development of a formalism and its numerical validation, leading to a proposed lateral beam displacement with sensitivity values as high as $10^{13} {\mu}m/RIU$. The deployment readiness is low as it is still in the basic research phase.",
