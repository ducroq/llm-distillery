  "reasoning": "This article presents research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a process relevant to plasma environments. While the research is scientifically sound and provides a quantified heating rate, its direct application to climate change mitigation is unclear and remains at a basic research stage with no immediate deployment pathway. The research is theoretical and lacks a clear path to economic viability or systemic impact on decarbonization.",
