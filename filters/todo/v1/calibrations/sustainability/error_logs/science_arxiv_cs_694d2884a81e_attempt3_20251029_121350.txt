  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation. It demonstrates lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy compared to baselines on benchmark datasets, suggesting improved utility-privacy trade-offs. However, it's still in the applied research stage with no deployed units or real-world applications, hence the lower scores on deployment readiness and economic viability.",
