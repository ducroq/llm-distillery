  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for coordinated beamforming in networked ISAC systems. It derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize localization performance and proposes algorithms for optimization. While the research is technically sound and peer-reviewed, it remains at the basic research stage with no deployed technology or measured outcomes, making it difficult to assess its real-world impact on climate or economic viability.",
