  "reasoning": "This paper presents an algorithm for computing committees that provide Proportional Justified Representation + (PJR+) in multiwinner approval elections. The algorithm makes $\mathcal{O}(\log( \sigma\cdot k))$ queries per voter, where $k$ is the desired committee size. While the research is theoretically sound, its direct impact on sustainability is minimal as it's focused on voting mechanisms and doesn't directly address climate change or environmental issues.",
