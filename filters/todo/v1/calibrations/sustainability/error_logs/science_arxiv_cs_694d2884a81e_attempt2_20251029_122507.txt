It shows improved utility-privacy trade-offs and reduced computational complexity compared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy. However, it is currently in the applied research stage, with no real-world deployment or quantified climate impact.",
