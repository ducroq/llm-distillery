  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study on coordinated beamforming for networked integrated sensing and communication. While the algorithms are developed and their effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations, there are no concrete deployments or measured outcomes in real-world settings. The research derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize localization performance, which adds to its technical credibility.",
