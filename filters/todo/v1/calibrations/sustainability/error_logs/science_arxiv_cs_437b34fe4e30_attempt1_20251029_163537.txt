  "reasoning": "This article presents theoretical improvements to the simplex method, a linear programming algorithm. While linear programming has broad applications, including optimization in sustainable systems, this research is at a very early stage and does not directly translate to measurable climate impact or deployment readiness. The technical credibility is high due to the peer-reviewed nature of the work and the quantified improvements in the algorithm's complexity.",
