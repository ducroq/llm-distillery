  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical model and simulation results for ion heating by Alfv\'en waves. While the research is technically sound and provides a quantified heating rate (Q), it remains in the basic research stage with no clear path to deployment or economic viability. The potential climate impact is indirect and speculative, depending on future applications of this research in plasma-based technologies.",
