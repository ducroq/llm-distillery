  "reasoning": "This article presents research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a phenomenon relevant to plasma environments. While the research provides a quantified relationship for the stochastic heating rate (Q), it remains at a theoretical stage with no immediate deployment or measurable impact on climate change. The research is peer-reviewed, increasing its credibility, but lacks economic viability and deployment readiness at this stage.",
