  "reasoning": "This research proposes a federated learning framework (\our) to reduce memory usage during model training, potentially enabling wider deployment of AI on resource-constrained devices. The concrete actions include partitioning the global model into blocks and training them sequentially. The paper presents experimental results showing up to 84.2% improvement in model performance, up to 50.4% reduction in peak memory usage, and up to 1.9x acceleration in training, but it is still in the research/prototype phase.",
