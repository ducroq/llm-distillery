  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for improving the accuracy of the PCG algorithm, which could indirectly improve the efficiency of simulations used in climate modeling and other computationally intensive sustainability applications. The concrete action is the development of a new algorithm framework with rigorous proofs. The evidence is based on theoretical results and numerical experiments, and the deployment readiness is at the basic research stage.",
