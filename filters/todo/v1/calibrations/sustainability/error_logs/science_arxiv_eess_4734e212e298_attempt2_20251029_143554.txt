  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study of coordinated beamforming for networked integrated sensing and communication, focusing on improving localization performance. It derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and proposes algorithms, but there are no deployments or real-world data. The potential climate impact is indirect, through improved efficiency of wireless systems, but not quantified.",
