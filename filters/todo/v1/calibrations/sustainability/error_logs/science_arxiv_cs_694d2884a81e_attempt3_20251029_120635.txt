It demonstrates improved utility-privacy trade-offs and reduced computational complexity compared to baseline methods, as measured by lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, it is still in the applied research stage with no deployment data or economic viability demonstrated.",
