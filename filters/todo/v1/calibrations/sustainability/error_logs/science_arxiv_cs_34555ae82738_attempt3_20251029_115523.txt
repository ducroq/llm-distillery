  "reasoning": "This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent algorithms, which are used in machine learning. While more efficient algorithms could indirectly contribute to sustainability by reducing energy consumption in training AI models, the impact is theoretical and difficult to quantify without specific applications and energy consumption data. The research is at a basic research stage with convergence rate analysis.",
