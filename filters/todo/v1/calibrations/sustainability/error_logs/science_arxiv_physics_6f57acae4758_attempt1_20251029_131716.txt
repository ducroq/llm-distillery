  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical formalism for giant Goos-Hänchen shift sensors, claiming a potential sensitivity improvement of $10^{13} {\mu}m/RIU$ compared to existing methods. While the theoretical description is confirmed numerically, there are no deployed sensors or operational data, placing it in the basic research stage. The climate impact is indirect, relying on the potential application of these sensors for environmental monitoring, but this is not explicitly stated or quantified.",
