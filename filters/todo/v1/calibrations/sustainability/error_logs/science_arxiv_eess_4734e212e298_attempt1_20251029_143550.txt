  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study on coordinated beamforming for networked ISAC, focusing on improving localization performance. The concrete action is the development of algorithms and derivation of a Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). The evidence is based on signal models and simulation results, but there are no deployed units or real-world data, placing it in the basic research stage.",
