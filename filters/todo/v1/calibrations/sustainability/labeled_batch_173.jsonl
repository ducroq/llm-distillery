This paper introduces TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that enhances the reasoning reliability of LLMs through explicit knowledge integration. TriMediQ first employs a frozen triplet extraction LLM to convert patient responses into clinically grounded triplets, ensuring factual precision via constrained prompting. These triplets are incorporated into a patient-specific Knowledge Graph (KG), from which a trainable projection module consisting of a graph encoder and a projector captures relational dependencies while keeping all LLM parameters frozen. During inference, the projection module guides multi-hop reasoning over the KG, enabling coherent clinical dialogue understanding. Experiments on two interactive medical QA benchmarks show that TriMediQ achieves up to 10.4\\% improvement in accuracy over five existing baselines on the iMedQA dataset. These results demonstrate that structuring patient information as triplets can effectively improve the reasoning capability of LLMs in multi-turn medical QA.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03536","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.700079","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Zhaohan Meng, Zaiqiao Meng, Siwei Liu, Iadh Ounis","raw_content_length":1306,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Question Answering","TriMediQ","LLM"],"persons":["Knowledge Graph"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1305,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Triplet","LLMs","TriMediQ","Announce Type","Large Language Models","strong performance","static medical Question Answering QA tasks","their reasoning","-turn clinical dialogues","patient information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Triplet":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"TriMediQ":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"strong performance":1.0,"static medical Question Answering QA tasks":1.0,"their reasoning":1.0,"-turn clinical dialogues":1.0,"patient information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7493194630555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.856,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.0713,"sadness":0.0189,"fear":0.0095,"anger":0.0188,"disgust":0.0135},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach (TriMediQ) to improve LLM reasoning in medical QA.

In this class of failures, a stressor such as a temporary spike in workload causes the system performance to drop and, subsequently, the system performance continues to remain low even when the stressor is removed. These failures have been reported by many large corporations and considered to be a rare but catastrophic source of availability outages in cloud systems. In this paper, we provide the mathematical foundations of metastability in request-response server systems. We model such systems using a domain-specific language. We show how to construct continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) that approximate the semantics of the programs through modeling and data-driven calibration. We use the structure of the CTMC models to provide a visualization of the qualitative behavior of the model. The visualization is a surprisingly effective way to identify system parameterizations that cause a system to show metastable behaviors. We complement the qualitative analysis with quantitative predictions. We provide a formal notion of metastable behaviors based on escape probabilities, and show that metastable behaviors are related to the eigenvalue structure of the CTMC. Our characterization leads to algorithmic tools to predict recovery times in metastable models of server systems. We have implemented our technique in a tool for the modeling and analysis of server systems. Through models inspired by failures in real request-response systems, we show that our qualitative visual analysis captures and predicts many instances of metastability that were observed in the field in a matter of milliseconds. Our algorithms confirm that recovery times surge as the system parameters approach metastable modes in the dynamics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03551","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.700503","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csse","research","cspf","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Peter Alvaro, Rebecca Isaacs, Rupak Majumdar, Kiran-Kumar Muniswamy-Reddy, Mahmoud Salamati, Sadegh Soudjani","raw_content_length":1855,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.345,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CTMC"],"persons":["Markov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1848,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Formal Analysis","Metastable Failures","Software Systems","the system performance","arXiv251003551v2","Announce Type","Abstract","Many large-scale software systems","metastable failures","this class"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Metastable Failures"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Formal Analysis":2.0,"Metastable Failures":2.0,"Software Systems":2.0,"the system performance":2.0,"arXiv251003551v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Many large-scale software systems":1.0,"metastable failures":1.0,"this class":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7493340644444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.32550000000000023,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9349,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2733,"joy":0.0044,"surprise":0.0573,"sadness":0.0269,"fear":0.5827,"anger":0.0406,"disgust":0.0148},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a formal analysis of metastable failures in software systems, which can lead to availability outages in cloud systems.

The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

We introduce the first simulation framework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework instantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses further reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and falsification.

Although a convergence rate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox algorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most effective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which is based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state of the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can exhibit slower $\\Omega(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play. In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new scale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call IREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$ (i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par with PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an analogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive* learning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\\ell_2$-)norm of the regret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate -- can decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the invariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us to derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does not rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness. Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive version of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate depends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the regret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04407","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.701869","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csgt","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":279,"author":"Brian Hu Zhang, Ioannis Anagnostides, Tuomas Sandholm","raw_content_length":1947,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.395,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Scale arXiv:2510.04407v2 Announce Type","Nemirovski"],"persons":["Nesterov","PRM$^+$","matching$^+$"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1942,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Scale","practice","arXiv251004407v2 Announce Type","Abstract","A considerable chasm","decades","theory","zero-sum game","first-order methods","a convergence rate"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Scale":2.0,"practice":2.0,"arXiv251004407v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"A considerable chasm":1.0,"decades":1.0,"theory":1.0,"zero-sum game":1.0,"first-order methods":1.0,"a convergence rate":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749379123333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.605,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.079,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8386,"joy":0.0086,"surprise":0.0344,"sadness":0.0257,"fear":0.0641,"anger":0.0127,"disgust":0.016},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm (IREG-PRM$^+$) for solving zero-sum games, achieving $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$ average-iterate convergence guarantees.

Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired \"where to look\" and \"why it matters\", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.702746","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Sheng Wang, Ruiming Wu, Charles Herndon, Yihang Liu, Shunsuke Koga, Jeanne Shen, Zhi Huang","raw_content_length":1971,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Pathology-CoT","LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1970,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pathology-CoT","Visual Chain","magnification","arXiv251004587v2 Announce Type","Abstract","a whole-slide image","an interactive multi-stage process","fields","recent pathology foundation models","superior performances"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Visual Chain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pathology-CoT":2.0,"Visual Chain":2.0,"magnification":2.0,"arXiv251004587v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a whole-slide image":1.0,"an interactive multi-stage process":1.0,"fields":1.0,"recent pathology foundation models":1.0,"superior performances":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749408129722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8333,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0201,"sadness":0.0119,"fear":0.0751,"anger":0.0289,"disgust":0.0262},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":true,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel AI system for pathology diagnosis.

However, in an image presenting lighting variations, the amplitude of the structuring function should vary according to the image intensity. Such a property is not verified in Mathematical Morphology for grey level functions, when the structuring function is summed to the image with the usual additive law. In order to address this issue, a new framework is defined with an additive law for which the amplitude of the structuring function varies according to the image amplitude. This additive law is chosen within the Logarithmic Image Processing framework and models the lighting variations with a physical cause such as a change of light intensity. The new framework is named Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology (LMM) and allows the definition of operators which are robust to such lighting variations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02007","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.726327","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathna","csna","computer-science","eessiv","research","mathfa","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Guillaume Noyel (CRESTIC)","raw_content_length":1075,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mathematical Morphology","the Logarithmic Image Processing"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1074,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology","theory","applications","Mathematical Morphology","an image","the structuring function","arXiv230902007v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","grey-level functions","another image"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology":2.0,"theory":2.0,"applications":2.0,"Mathematical Morphology":2.0,"an image":2.0,"the structuring function":2.0,"arXiv230902007v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"grey-level functions":1.0,"another image":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7502389050000002,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8418,"joy":0.0115,"surprise":0.1033,"sadness":0.0132,"fear":0.0073,"anger":0.0143,"disgust":0.0086},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for image processing that could potentially improve the robustness of image analysis in applications relevant to sustainability, such as environmental monitoring or resource management.

Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the \"what\" and \"where\" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00919","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.726772","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","eessiv","cslg","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Gongping Chen, Lei Zhao, Xiaotao Yin, Liang Cui, Jianxun Zhang, Yu Dai, Ningning Liu","raw_content_length":1611,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BAAF","Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework","PHAM"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1610,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["BAAF","A benchmark attention adaptive framework","medical ultrasound image segmentation tasks","arXiv231000919v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs","medical ultrasound images","Complex scenario","ultrasound image","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"BAAF":3.0,"A benchmark attention adaptive framework":2.0,"medical ultrasound image segmentation tasks":2.0,"arXiv231000919v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs":1.0,"medical ultrasound images":1.0,"Complex scenario":1.0,"ultrasound image":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750253903611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6254,"joy":0.0275,"surprise":0.0333,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.21,"anger":0.0743,"disgust":0.0221},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel AI framework (BAAF) for improving medical ultrasound image segmentation.

Central to our proof is a desingularization theorem, which applies to open, dense neighborhoods around each orbit in $R(G)/G$ and may be of independent interest.

This classical problem remains practically unsolved for many types of structured or sparse data, as it rests on a computationally difficult core task: to produce a reliable sample from lattice points in a high-dimensional polytope. We translate the problem into a Markov decision process and demonstrate a reinforcement learning approach for learning `good moves' for sampling. We illustrate the approach on data sets and models for which traditional MCMC samplers converge too slowly due to problem size, sparsity structure, and the requirement to use prohibitive non-linear algebra computations in the process.

However, in almost any real-world dataset the ID depends on the scale at which the data are analysed. Quite typically at a small scale, the ID is very large, as the data are affected by measurement errors. At large scale, the ID can also be erroneously large, due to the curvature and the topology of the manifold containing the data. In this work, we introduce an automatic protocol to select the sweet spot, namely the correct range of scales in which the ID is meaningful and useful. This protocol is based on imposing that for distances smaller than the correct scale the density of the data is constant. In the presented framework, to estimate the density it is necessary to know the ID, therefore, this condition is imposed self-consistently. We illustrate the usefulness and robustness of this procedure by benchmarks on artificial and real-world datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15132","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.728066","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statml","computer-science","statco","cslg","research","statme","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Antonio Di Noia, Iuri Macocco, Aldo Glielmo, Alessandro Laio, Antonietta Mira","raw_content_length":1108,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Intrinsic Dimension"],"persons":["arXiv:2405.15132v3 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1107,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the ID","the noise","optimal neighbourhood identification","which","the data","arXiv240515132v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","The Intrinsic Dimension","a key concept","unsupervised learning and feature selection"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the ID":3.0,"the noise":2.0,"optimal neighbourhood identification":2.0,"which":2.0,"the data":2.0,"arXiv240515132v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The Intrinsic Dimension":1.0,"a key concept":1.0,"unsupervised learning and feature selection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7503023625,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.903,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0576,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.01,"anger":0.0101,"disgust":0.0088},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new method for estimating intrinsic dimension in datasets, which could potentially improve feature selection in machine learning models used for sustainability applications.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fef341e15862","title":"Persistent Homology via Ellipsoids","content":"arXiv:2408.11450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in topological data analysis. An initial step in its use involves constructing a nested sequence of simplicial complexes. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with \\v{C}ech, Rips, alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a novel type of geometrically informed simplicial complex, called a Rips-type ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points, as used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present an algorithm for computing Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on Rips-type ellipsoid complexes. Additionally, we show that the ellipsoid barcodes depend continuously on the input data so that small perturbations of a k-generic point cloud lead to proportionally small changes in the resulting ellipsoid barcodes. This provides a theoretical guarantee analogous, if somewhat weaker, to the classical stability results for Rips and \\v{C}ech filtrations. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that Rips-type ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating the homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to ground-truth topological features are longer compared to those obtained using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11450","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.728933","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathat","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Niklas Canova, Sara Kali\\v{s}nik, Aaron Moser, Bastian Rieck, Ana \\v{Z}egarac","raw_content_length":1975,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.36,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ellipsoids arXiv:2408.11450v2","Rips","Principal Component Analysis"],"persons":["Alpha"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1974,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Persistent Homology","Ellipsoids","replace-cross Abstract","Persistent homology","the most popular methods","topological data analysis","An initial step","its use","a nested sequence","simplicial complexes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Persistent Homology":2.0,"Ellipsoids":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Persistent homology":1.0,"the most popular methods":1.0,"topological data analysis":1.0,"An initial step":1.0,"its use":1.0,"a nested sequence":1.0,"simplicial complexes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750331937777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.008000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8016,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9101,"joy":0.0126,"surprise":0.0161,"sadness":0.0027,"fear":0.0252,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0146},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for topological data analysis.

However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35-1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR).

We extend the notion of systemic risk measures from Biagini, Fouque, Fritelli and Meyer-Brandis (2019) to graph structured data. In particular, we focus on an aggregation function that is derived from a market clearing algorithm proposed by Eisenberg and Noe (2001). In this setting, we show the existence of an optimal random allocation that distributes the overall minimal bailout capital and secures the network. We study numerical methods for the approximation of systemic risk and optimal random allocations. We propose to use permutation equivariant architectures of neural networks like graph neural networks (GNNs) and a class that we name (extended) permutation equivariant neural networks ((X)PENNs). We compare their performance to several benchmark allocations. The main feature of GNNs and (X)PENNs is that they are permutation equivariant with respect to the underlying graph data. In numerical experiments we find evidence that these permutation equivariant methods are superior to other approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07222","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.731108","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","q-fincp","q-finmf","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Lukas Gonon, Thilo Meyer-Brandis, Niklas Weber","raw_content_length":1200,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Meyer-Brandis","Graph Neural Networks arXiv:2410.07222v2"],"persons":["Eisenberg","Fritelli","Computing Systemic Risk Measures"],"locations":["Biagini","Noe"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1199,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Computing Systemic Risk Measures","Graph Neural Networks","systemic risk measures","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","This paper","stochastic financial networks","explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities","the notion","Biagini"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Graph Neural Networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Computing Systemic Risk Measures":2.0,"Graph Neural Networks":2.0,"systemic risk measures":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"stochastic financial networks":1.0,"explicitly modelled bilateral liabilities":1.0,"the notion":1.0,"Biagini":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7504120430555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.7015000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6597,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8447,"joy":0.0259,"surprise":0.0388,"sadness":0.0112,"fear":0.0515,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.0077},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel method using Graph Neural Networks to assess systemic risk in financial networks.

Minimizing the overhead of distillation is crucial for the realization of quantum computation and other technologies. Here we explicitly demonstrate how, for general quantum resources, suitably designed quantum catalysts (i.e., auxiliary systems that remain unchanged before and after the process) enable distillation with constant overhead in the practical one-shot setting, thereby overcoming the established logarithmic lower bound for one-shot distillation overhead. In particular, for magic state distillation, our catalysis method paves a path for tackling the diverging batch size problem associated with code-based low-overhead protocols by enabling arbitrary reduction of the protocol size for any desired accuracy. Notably, this first yields constant-overhead magic state distillation methods with controllable protocol size. Furthermore, we demonstrate a tunable spacetime trade-off between overhead and success probability enabled by catalysts which offers significant versatility for practical implementation. Finally, we extend catalysis techniques to dynamical quantum resources and show that channel mutual information determines one-shot catalytic channel transformation, thereby advancing our understanding for both dynamical catalysis and information theory.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14547","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.731512","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csit","computer-science","research","mathit","quant-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Kun Fang, Zi-Wen Liu","raw_content_length":1435,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1434,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["distillation","replace-cross Abstract","Quantum resource distillation","a fundamental task","quantum information science","technology","the overhead","the realization","quantum computation","other technologies"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["quantum information science"],"hydrogen_energy":["technology"],"healthcare_tech":["technology"],"renewable_energy":["technology"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"distillation":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Quantum resource distillation":1.0,"a fundamental task":1.0,"quantum information science":1.0,"technology":1.0,"the overhead":1.0,"the realization":1.0,"quantum computation":1.0,"other technologies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7504259052777775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.926,"joy":0.0232,"surprise":0.0315,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0031,"anger":0.0087,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical method for quantum resource distillation with constant overhead using quantum catalysts.

The framework is based on using the degrees of freedom associated to a Galerkin discretization as the fundamental lattice variables. We formulate standard concepts in lattice field theory, such as the partition function and correlation functions, in terms of the degrees of freedom. For example, using continuous finite element spaces, we show that the two-point spatial correlation function can be defined between any two points on the domain (as opposed to at just lattice sites) and furthermore, that this satisfies a weak propagator (or Green's function) identity, in analogy to the continuum case. Furthermore, this framework leads naturally to higher-order formulations of lattice field theories by considering higher-order finite element spaces for the Galerkin discretization. We consider analytical and numerical examples of scalar field theory to investigate how increasing the order of piecewise polynomial finite element spaces affect the approximation of lattice observables. Finally, we sketch an outline of this Galerkin framework in the context of gauge field theories.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15343","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.731934","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathna","csna","hep-lat","computer-science","research","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Brian K.

To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation.

Stereo matching with binocular endoscopy can provide this depth information.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{RRESM}, a real-time stereo matching method tailored for endoscopic images. Our approach integrates a 3D Mamba Coordinate Attention module that enhances cost aggregation through position-sensitive attention maps and long-range spatial dependency modeling via the Mamba block, generating a robust cost volume without substantial computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a High-Frequency Disparity Optimization module that refines disparity predictions near tissue boundaries by amplifying high-frequency details in the wavelet domain.

We also provide an axiomatisation of this class of compromise values using variants of the minimal rights property and restricted proportionality. We introduce two construction methods for properly devised compromise values. Under mild conditions, one can use either a lower or an upper bound to construct a well-defined compromise value. We construct and axiomatise various well-known and new compromise values based on these methods, including the $\\tau$-, the $\\chi$-, the Gately, the CIS-, the PANSC-, the EANSC-, and the new KM-values.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c3f92b699c1d","title":"BrainOmni: A Brain Foundation Model for Unified EEG and MEG Signals","content":"arXiv:2505.18185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18185","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.733962","language":"en","tags":["preprints","eesssp","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Qinfan Xiao, Ziyun Cui, Chi Zhang, Siqi Chen, Wen Wu, Andrew Thwaites, Alexandra Woolgar, Bowen Zhou, Chao Zhang","raw_content_length":1862,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BrainTokenizer","MEG","EEG","MEG Signals arXiv:2505.18185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross","BrainOmni"],"persons":["Electroencephalography","Sensor Encoder"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1861,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["BrainOmni"," A Brain Foundation Model","Unified EEG","MEG Signals","EEG","MEG","replace-cross Abstract","Electroencephalography","magnetoencephalography","neural activity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["BrainOmni"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"BrainOmni":2.0," A Brain Foundation Model":2.0,"Unified EEG":2.0,"MEG Signals":2.0,"EEG":2.0,"MEG":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Electroencephalography":1.0,"magnetoencephalography":1.0,"neural activity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7505171341666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8267,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.1047,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0193,"anger":0.0216,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel brain foundation model (BrainOmni) for unifying EEG and MEG signals, pre-trained on a large dataset of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data.

However, its effectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant variables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are missing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While several notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they typically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility and adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address these challenges simultaneously. Our approach incorporates a data-driven penalty matrix into penalized clustering to enable more flexible variable selection, along with a mechanism that explicitly models the relationship between missingness and latent class membership. We demonstrate that, under certain regularity conditions, the proposed framework achieves both asymptotic consistency and selection consistency, even in the presence of missing data. This unified strategy significantly enhances the capability and efficiency of model-based clustering, advancing methodologies for identifying informative variables that define homogeneous subgroups in the presence of complex missing data patterns. The performance of the framework, including its computational efficiency, is evaluated through simulations and demonstrated using both synthetic and real-world transcriptomic datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19093","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.734372","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statml","computer-science","cslg","research","statme","statth","statap","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Binh H.

Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.734805","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","physicsapp-ph","computer-science","cslg","research","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Reza Marzban, Ali Adibi, Raphael Pestourie","raw_content_length":1552,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Representation Learning arXiv:2507.00546v2"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1551,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Inverse Design","Nanophotonics","Representation Learning","Inverse design","nanophotonics","the computational discovery","structures","targeted electromagnetic EM responses","a key tool","recent optical advances"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["the computational discovery"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Inverse Design":2.0,"Nanophotonics":2.0,"Representation Learning":2.0,"Inverse design":1.0,"nanophotonics":1.0,"the computational discovery":1.0,"structures":1.0,"targeted electromagnetic EM responses":1.0,"a key tool":1.0,"recent optical advances":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7505467755555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7521,"joy":0.0443,"surprise":0.0792,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0706,"anger":0.0316,"disgust":0.0146},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a machine learning approach to nanophotonics design, which could potentially lead to more efficient optical devices.

Deep learning achieved SOTA performance on stained, high-contrast images but needs large labeled datasets, expensive hardware, and fails under uneven illumination. This study presents a low-cost, lightweight, annotation-free segmentation method by introducing one-time calibration-assisted unsupervised framework adaptable across imaging modalities and image type. The framework determines background via spatial standard deviation from the local mean. Uncertain pixels are resolved using fuzzy logic, cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity, statistical features, followed by post-segmentation denoising calibration which is saved as a profile for reuse until noise pattern or object type substantially change. The program runs as a script or graphical interface for non-programmers. The method was rigorously evaluated using \\textit{IoU}, \\textit{F1-score}, and other metrics, with statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. On unstained brightfield myoblast (C2C12) images, it outperformed \\textit{Cellpose 3.0} and \\textit{StarDist}, improving IoU by up to 48\\% (average IoU = 0.43, F1 = 0.60).

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3d0b4b1a7894","title":"Increase Alpha: Performance and Risk of an AI","content":"arXiv:2509.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: There are inefficiencies in financial markets, with unexploited patterns in price, volume, and cross-sectional relationships. While many approaches use large-scale transformers, we take a domain-focused path: feed-forward and recurrent networks with curated features to capture subtle regularities in noisy financial data. This smaller-footprint design is computationally lean and reliable under low signal-to-noise, crucial for daily production at scale. At Increase Alpha, we built a deep-learning framework that maps over 800 U.S. equities into daily directional signals with minimal computational overhead. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we outline the general overview of the predictive model without disclosing its core underlying concepts. Second, we evaluate its real-time performance through transparent, industry standard metrics. Forecast accuracy is benchmarked against both naive baselines and macro indicators. The performance outcomes are summarized via cumulative returns, annualized Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The best portfolio combination using our signals provides a low-risk, continuous stream of returns with a Sharpe ratio of more than 2.5, maximum drawdown of around 3%, and a near-zero correlation with the S&P 500 market benchmark. We also compare the model's performance through different market regimes, such as the recent volatile movements of the US equity market in the beginning of 2025. Our analysis showcases the robustness of the model and significantly stable performance during these volatile periods. Collectively, these findings show that market inefficiencies can be systematically harvested with modest computational overhead if the right variables are considered. This report will emphasize the potential of traditional deep learning frameworks for generating an AI-driven edge in the financial market.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16707","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.738111","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","q-finpm","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":264,"author":"Sid Ghatak, Arman Khaledian, Navid Parvini, Nariman Khaledian","raw_content_length":1934,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.32,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["noisy financial data","Forecast"],"persons":[],"locations":["U.S."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1925,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Increase Alpha","Performance","Risk","an AI","replace-cross Abstract","inefficiencies","financial markets","unexploited patterns","price","volume"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["an AI"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Increase Alpha":2.0,"Performance":2.0,"Risk":2.0,"an AI":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"inefficiencies":1.0,"financial markets":1.0,"unexploited patterns":1.0,"price":1.0,"volume":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7506685241666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.091,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3818,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.791,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0268,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.1362,"anger":0.0197,"disgust":0.0091},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed AI model used in financial markets.

A systematic, cross-task understanding of how different noise types impact these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to simulated quantum (Poisson) and electronic (Gaussian) noise in two key chest X-ray tasks: semantic segmentation and pulmonary disease classification. Using a novel, scalable noise injection framework, we applied controlled, clinically-motivated noise severities to common architectures (UNet, DeepLabV3, FPN; ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) on public datasets (Landmark, ChestX-ray14). Our results reveal a stark dichotomy in task robustness. Semantic segmentation models proved highly vulnerable, with lung segmentation performance collapsing under severe electronic noise (Dice Similarity Coefficient drop of 0.843), signifying a near-total model failure. In contrast, classification tasks demonstrated greater overall resilience, but this robustness was not uniform. We discovered a differential vulnerability: certain tasks, such as distinguishing Pneumothorax from Atelectasis, failed catastrophically under quantum noise (AUROC drop of 0.355), while others were more susceptible to electronic noise. These findings demonstrate that while classification models possess a degree of inherent robustness, pixel-level segmentation tasks are far more brittle. The task- and noise-specific nature of model failure underscores the critical need for targeted validation and mitigation strategies before the safe clinical deployment of diagnostic AI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25265","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.738524","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","eessiv","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Derek Jiu, Kiran Nijjer, Nishant Chinta, Ryan Bui, Kevin Zhu","raw_content_length":1758,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DenseNet","EfficientNet","ResNet"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1757,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Impact","Radiographic Noise","Chest X","arXiv250925265v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Deep learning models","radiographic analysis","their reliability","the stochastic noise","clinical imaging"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Impact":2.0,"Radiographic Noise":2.0,"Chest X":2.0,"arXiv250925265v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Deep learning models":1.0,"radiographic analysis":1.0,"their reliability":1.0,"the stochastic noise":1.0,"clinical imaging":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7506851386111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8346,"joy":0.01,"surprise":0.0415,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.051,"anger":0.029,"disgust":0.0214},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies vulnerabilities in deep learning models used for chest X-ray analysis when exposed to different types of noise.

We highlight the distinctions between planning, where approximating MDPs can be independently designed, and learning (either via Q-learning or empirical model learning), where approximating MDPs are restricted to be defined by invariant measures of Markov chains under exploration policies, leading to significant subtleties on quantizer design performance, even though asymptotic near optimality can be established under both setups.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c8888db27d17","title":"On Limits on the Provable Consequences of Quantum Pseudorandomness","content":"arXiv:2510.05393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: There are various notions of quantum pseudorandomness, such as pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs), pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs) and pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRSFGs). Unlike the different notions of classical pseudorandomness, which are known to be existentially equivalent to each other, the relation between quantum pseudorandomness has yet to be fully established. We present some evidence suggesting that some quantum pseudorandomness is unlikely to be constructed from the others, or at least is hard to construct unless some conjectures are false. This indicates that quantum pseudorandomness could behave quite differently from classical pseudorandomness. We study new oracle worlds where one quantum pseudorandomness exists but another pseudorandomness does not under some assumptions or constraints, and provide potential directions to achieve the full black-box separation. More precisely: - We give a unitary oracle relative to which PRFSGs exist but PRUs without using ancilla do not. This can be extended to the general PRUs if we can prove a structural property of the PRU algorithm. - Assuming an isoperimetric inequality-style conjecture, we show a unitary oracle world where log-length output PRFSGs exist but proving the existence of quantum-computable pseudorandom generators (QPRGs) with negligible correctness error is as hard as proving that ${\\sf BQP}\\neq {\\sf QCMA}$. This result suggests that the inverse-polynomial error in the state of the art construction of QPRGs from log-length PRSGs is inherent. - Assuming the same conjecture, we prove that some natural way of constructing super-log-length output PRSGs from log-length output PRFSGs is impossible. This partly complements the known hardness of shrinking the PRSG output lengths. Along the way, we also discuss other potential approaches to extend the PRSG output lengths.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05393","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.740127","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscr","research","quant-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Samuel Bouaziz--Ermann, Minki Hhan, Garazi Muguruza, Quoc-Huy Vu","raw_content_length":1945,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum Pseudorandomness","quantum pseudorandomness"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1936,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Limits","the Provable Consequences","Quantum Pseudorandomness","quantum pseudorandomness","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","various notions","pseudorandom unitaries","PRUs","PRSGs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Limits":2.0,"the Provable Consequences":2.0,"Quantum Pseudorandomness":2.0,"quantum pseudorandomness":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"various notions":1.0,"pseudorandom unitaries":1.0,"PRUs":1.0,"PRSGs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7507428822222226,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.897,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.0374,"sadness":0.0119,"fear":0.0098,"anger":0.0198,"disgust":0.0157},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research exploring the limits of quantum pseudorandomness.

A hallmark of our construction is that the effective radius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a coupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound and consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The models preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically excluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this class of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the non-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the coupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges correctly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A further subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source charge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge arising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the self energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in the strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike structure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically. These findings highlight how nonlinear field equations reconcile theoretical prescription with experimental measurement and suggest a classical rationale for the effective invisibility of the electron substructure.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11733","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.024925","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","physicsclass-ph","hep-th","research","math-ph","hep-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Tengyang Liu, Yisong Yang","raw_content_length":1699,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Maxwell","Electrodynamics","The Effective Radius"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1698,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Effective Radius","an Electric Point Charge","Nonlinear Electrodynamics","arXiv251011733v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the century-old problem","the electron","a pointlike particle","finite self energy","a new class"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Effective Radius":2.0,"an Electric Point Charge":2.0,"Nonlinear Electrodynamics":2.0,"arXiv251011733v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the century-old problem":1.0,"the electron":1.0,"a pointlike particle":1.0,"finite self energy":1.0,"a new class":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750946609166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.200999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8402,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7604,"joy":0.0399,"surprise":0.1382,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0168,"anger":0.0325,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical physics research exploring modifications to electrodynamics.

A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11765","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.026261","language":"en","tags":["mathds","preprints","physicsapp-ph","physicsclass-ph","research","cond-matmtrl-sci","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Jos\\'e Geraldo Telles Ribeiro, Americo Cunha Jr","raw_content_length":1471,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["arXiv:2510.11765v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1470,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Advanced creep modelling","polymers","A variable","arXiv251011765v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation","constant stress","which","rupture","static fatigue"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Advanced creep modelling":2.0,"polymers":2.0,"A variable":2.0,"arXiv251011765v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation":1.0,"constant stress":1.0,"which":1.0,"rupture":1.0,"static fatigue":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7509944813888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.6455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3291,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8428,"joy":0.0027,"surprise":0.0449,"sadness":0.0174,"fear":0.0375,"anger":0.0392,"disgust":0.0155},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a new model for predicting polymer creep, which could lead to more durable and reliable plastic products.

Despite recent progress in the development of negative-index metamaterials, losses continue to be a significant barrier to realizing optical antimatter. In this work, we show that passive, lossy materials can be used to realize optical antimatter when illuminated by light at a complex frequency. We further establish that one can engineer arbitrary complex-valued permittivity and permeability in such materials. Strikingly, we show that materials with a positive index at real frequencies can act as negative-index materials under complex frequency excitation. Using our approach, we numerically demonstrate the optical antimatter functionality, as well as double focusing by an ideal perfect lens and superscattering.

However, nanophotonic environments typically involve several modes that spectrally overlap and interfere, giving rise to sharp dip features such as Fano profiles in the electromagnetic spectral density. Here, we identify these features as interference-induced resonances, effective electromagnetic modes with complex, non-Hermitian couplings to quantum emitters. We show that these modes hybridize with emitters to form polaritons even when the system parameters do not satisfy the single-mode strong-coupling criterion. Moreover, the resulting polaritons differ in their decay rates, a phenomenon we term imaginary Rabi splitting. Extending the analysis to ensembles, we find that coupling to interference-induced resonances produces long-lived polaritons that can outlast excitonic dark states. Numerical simulations of a realistic hybrid metallodielectric platform confirm these predictions and demonstrate their robustness against disorder and loss. Our results reveal a new polaritonic regime beyond the single-mode description, offering new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11850","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.027478","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Anael Ben-Asher, Antonio I.

Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum.

Electro-optic modulators are essential components in modern photonic systems, enabling high-speed control of light for applications ranging from telecommunications to quantum communication. Conventional inline and Mach-Zehnder modulators, while widely adopted, are limited by bias drift, high operating voltages, and polarization-mode dispersion. Sagnac loop-based modulators have recently emerged as a promising alternative, offering inherent stability against environmental fluctuations and eliminating the need for active bias control. In this work, we present a comprehensive model of the Sagnac modulator that captures both intensity and polarization modulation. We analyze the role of asymmetry in the loop, highlighting its impact on the achievable repetition rate, and propose modulation strategies to overcome these constraints. Finally, we investigate the symmetric Sagnac configuration and demonstrate practical techniques for achieving robust modulation while mitigating experimental challenges. Our results establish the Sagnac modulator as a versatile and stable platform for next-generation photonic and quantum communication systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11873","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.028722","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","quant-ph","physicsoptics","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Federico Berra, Mat\\'ias Rub\\'en Bola\\~nos, Alberto De Toni, Kannan Vijayadharan, Costantino Agnesi, Marco Avesani, Andrea Stanco, Paolo Villoresi, Giuseppe Vallone","raw_content_length":1284,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["overc","Sagnac arXiv:2510.11873v1 Announce Type","Sagnac"],"persons":["Mach"],"locations":["Electro"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1283,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["General model and modulation strategies","Sagnac","Announce Type","new Abstract","recent decades","an increasing demand","faster modulation schemes","Electro-optic modulators","essential components","modern photonic systems"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"General model and modulation strategies":2.0,"Sagnac":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"recent decades":1.0,"an increasing demand":1.0,"faster modulation schemes":1.0,"Electro-optic modulators":1.0,"essential components":1.0,"modern photonic systems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7510863825,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8683,"joy":0.0175,"surprise":0.0849,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0059,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical model for Sagnac modulators, which could potentially improve the efficiency and stability of photonic systems used in telecommunications and quantum communication.

In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \\`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \\times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11874","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.029161","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsplasm-ph","physicsapp-ph","research","physicscomp-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":270,"author":"A.

However, these attributes also make ripples excellent flow indicators, and they have been used extensively in planetary locations for this purpose. Here, we use terrestrial laser scanning to measure ripple morphometry and celerity coincidently, as well as saltation height above rippled surfaces. We find that although ripple height and wavelength respond linearly to increased shear velocity, under strong winds ripple celerity exhibits a non-linear increase. This relationship at high wind speeds is also reflected in the response of aerodynamic roughness and saltation dynamics, with a greater maximum saltation height present over ripple lee slopes. Importantly, when using ripple patterns as indicators of flow conditions, celerity or height should be used in preference to wavelength as their dynamics respond faster to changing wind speed. In planetary and stratigraphic settings where measuring celerity is not possible, wavelength should be considered as indicative of consistent wind conditions rather than the full range of sand transporting wind speeds.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11876","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.029577","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsgeo-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"J.

Metasurface-based platforms offer unique advantages because of their compact design, energy efficiency, and the ability to precisely manipulate light at the subwavelength scale, in a contact-less fashion. However, achieving both high transmission modulation and low optical loss in the telecom band remains a challenge. This study develops monolithic and hybrid metasurfaces based on the phase change material antimony trisulfide (Sb$_2$S$_3$) to address this limitation. First, we demonstrate the capability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ to offer up to ~91 percent modulation, even with a magnetic dipole - a low-Q resonance. It lifts the requirement for complex precisely fabricated metasurfaces, a long-standing limitation in the community for all optical switching. Furthermore, with the most straightforward hybridisation approach, i.e. depositing a thin film of silicon, we improved the simulated modulation depth to 99 percent. Experimentally, over 80 percent modulation was achieved for both hybrid and monolithic structures, with nearly 2-fold less power required for switching in the hybrid design whilst maintaining high modulation depth. This performance results from the significant refractive index tunability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and its intrinsically low optical loss (k < 10^{-4}) in the telecom band, further enhanced by silicon integration. The demonstrated metasurfaces offer an effective and scalable approach for all-optical light modulation with strong potential for integration into CMOS-compatible photonic circuits and next-generation telecommunications systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11881","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.030430","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Amin Zamani, Gabriel Sanderson, Lu Zhang, Qiwei Miao, Sara Moujdi, Ze Zheng, Mohammadhossein Momtazpour, Christopher J.

Exosomes diffuse slowly, can be actively degraded, and contain stochastic amounts of molecular cargo. These features raise the question of the efficacy of exosomes as a directional signal, but this question has not be systematically investigated. We develop a theoretical and computational approach to quantify the limits of exosome-mediated chemotaxis at the individual cell level. In our model, a leader cell secretes exosomes, which diffuse in the extracellular space, and a follower cell guides its migration by integrating discrete exosome detections over a finite memory window. We combine analytical calculations and stochastic simulations and show that the chemotactic velocity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the exosome cargo size. Small exosomes produce frequent but weak signals, whereas large exosomes produce strong but infrequent encounters. In the presence of nonlinear signal transduction, this tradeoff leads to an optimal cargo size that maximizes information throughput, as quantified by the average speed of the follower cell. Using a reduced one-dimensional model, we derive closed-form expressions coupling the optimal cargo size to follower speed as a function of secretion rate, memory time, and detection sensitivity. These results identify molecular packaging and memory integration as key determinants of exosome-mediated information transmission and highlight general design principles for optimization of migration under guidance by discrete and diffusible signaling particles.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11909","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.031973","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsbio-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Louis Gonz\\'alez, Andrew Mugler","raw_content_length":1691,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.165,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Exosome arXiv:2510.11909v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1690,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Exosome","exosomes","new Abstract","Cells","extracellular vesicles","long distances","collective actions","Exosomes","stochastic amounts","molecular cargo"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["Cells"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Exosome":2.0,"exosomes":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Cells":1.0,"extracellular vesicles":1.0,"long distances":1.0,"collective actions":1.0,"Exosomes":1.0,"stochastic amounts":1.0,"molecular cargo":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751198292222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.678,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0644,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8622,"joy":0.0072,"surprise":0.0541,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0159,"anger":0.0297,"disgust":0.0229},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research exploring the efficiency of exosome-mediated chemotaxis.
