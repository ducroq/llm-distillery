Oman now focuses on developing more human-centered cities, enhancing community well-being, boosting the local economy, and increasing investments. This study addresses a research gap by examining the social and economic impact of the sustainable neighborhood “Al-Mouj” on the nearby urban area “Al-Mawaleh North” to maximize sustainability benefits. It analyzes how a sustainable neighborhood influences the economy, society, quality of life, and overall well-being. The study also identifies key factors driving the growth of sustainable practices in society and the economy. It has four main objectives in terms of answering the research question, primarily through surveys of community members and business owners, and by analyzing land use development around Al-Mouj. Data collection methods include literature review, case study, questionnaires, and interviews. Data analysis employs spatial, statistical, and thematic techniques. Responses from 515 participants are examined to ensure reliable results. Ethnographic methods are used to gain insights from open-ended questionnaire responses and interviews. The results confirm that Al-Mouj’s mixed-use development and sustainability features positively influence mental and physical health and stimulate economic activity within the local community. This study provides decision-makers and urban planners valuable insights into sustainable neighborhoods’ social and economic impacts when developed as open communities. It highlights the challenges of following international NSAT standards, which do not fully address local concerns.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9037","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:34:17.841239","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Mohamed Ali Mohamed Khalil","raw_content_length":1791,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Al-Mawaleh North","Social and Economic Influence of Sustainable Development: The Case of Al","the Oman National Spatial Strategy","Oman Vision 2040"],"persons":["Al-Mouj"],"locations":["Oman"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1731,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Social and Economic Influence","Sustainable Development","The Case","Oman","The sultanate","other nations","sustainability","Oman Vision"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Sustainable Development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Social and Economic Influence":2.0,"Sustainable Development":2.0,"The Case":2.0,"Oman":2.0,"The sultanate":1.0,"other nations":1.0,"sustainability":1.0,"Oman Vision":1.0}},"age_hours":18.648675943611114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8939,"joy":0.0378,"surprise":0.0195,"sadness":0.0127,"fear":0.0054,"anger":0.0141,"disgust":0.0165},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study analyzes the impact of the Al-Mouj sustainable neighborhood on the surrounding area, finding positive influences on mental and physical health and economic activity.

A scale-adaptive high-resolution imaging architecture is established using a rotating-prism-embedded variable-boresight camera. By planning to prism motion, the multi-view images with rich information are combined to form a large-scale FOV image. The boresight is guided towards the region of interest (ROI) in the combined FOV to reconstruct super-resolution (SR) images with the desired information. A novel distortion correction method is proposed using virtual symmetrical prisms with rotation angles that are complementary. Based on light reverse tracing, the dispersion induced by monochromatic lights with different refractive indices can be eliminated by accurate pixel-level position compensation. For resolution enhancement, we provide a new scheme for SR imaging consisting of the residual removal network and information enhancement network by multi-view image fusion. The experiments show that the proposed architecture can achieve both large-FOV scene imaging for situational awareness and SR ROI display to acquire details, effectively perform distortion and dispersion correction, and alleviate the occlusion to a certain extent. It also provides higher image clarity compared to the traditional SR methods and overcomes the problem of balancing large-scale imaging and high-resolution imaging.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6313","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:34:19.767400","language":"en","tags":["sensors","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Jialiang Jin","raw_content_length":1422,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FOV","Scale-Adaptive High-Resolution Imaging Using a Rotating-Prism Large"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1422,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Scale-Adaptive High-Resolution Imaging","a Rotating-Prism","view","high-resolution imaging","the goals","technology","A scale-adaptive high-resolution imaging architecture","a rotating-prism-embedded variable-boresight camera"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["view"],"hydrogen_energy":["technology"],"healthcare_tech":["technology"],"renewable_energy":["technology"],"engineering":["a rotating-prism-embedded variable-boresight camera"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Scale-Adaptive High-Resolution Imaging":2.0,"a Rotating-Prism":2.0,"view":1.0,"high-resolution imaging":1.0,"the goals":1.0,"technology":1.0,"A scale-adaptive high-resolution imaging architecture":1.0,"a rotating-prism-embedded variable-boresight camera":1.0}},"age_hours":18.649741731944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9267,"joy":0.0133,"surprise":0.0347,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.0101,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel imaging architecture using a rotating prism for high-resolution and large-FOV imaging.

Snowfall and ice accumulation impair vehicle control and affect driver perception and performance. Road markings are often obscured, forcing drivers to rely on intuition and memory to stay in their lane, which can lead to encroachment into adjacent lanes or sidewalks. Current lane detectors assist in lane keeping, but their performance is compromised by visual disturbances such as ice reflection, snowflake movement, fog, and snow cover. Furthermore, testing these systems with users on actual snowy roads involves risks to driver safety, equipment integrity, and ethical compliance. This study presents a low-cost virtual reality simulation for evaluating winter lane detection in controlled and safe conditions from a human-in-the-loop perspective. Participants drove in a simulated snowy scenario with and without the detector while quantitative and qualitative variables were monitored. Results showed a 49.9% reduction in unintentional lane departures with the detector and significantly improved user experience, as measured by the UEQ-S (p = 0.023, Cohen’s d = 0.72). Participants also reported higher perceived safety, situational awareness, and confidence.

Here we exploited the heterotrophic growth ability of Cyclotella cryptica to create the first diatom photosynthetic mutant by CRISPR-Cas inactivation of the nucleus-encoded ATP synthase subunit {gamma}. These mutants showed impaired phototrophic capacity and altered thylakoids morphology. In absence of {gamma}-ATP, protons that accumulate in the thylakoid lumen slow down the cytochrome b6f complex, thus keeping the electron carriers downhill oxidized. These results, reversible when the proton gradient is suppressed, demonstrate the existence of a photosynthetic control in diatoms. At variance with the wild type, {gamma}-ATP synthase mutants cannot grow heterotrophically in darkness nor in the light when photosystem II is inhibited. This requirement of heterotrophic growth on photosynthetic electron transfer or on the presence of plastidial ATP synthase suggests that the proton motive force (pmf) is a central integrator of the metabolic interaction between photosynthesis and heterotrophy. Our results establish C. crytica as a robust model for analysis of photosynthetic function, regulation and metabolic integration in organisms with secondary plastids.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681070v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:35:12.537635","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Jensen, E., Audoor, S., Kuras, R., Seleem, B., Rogato, A., D'Ippolito, G., Benvenuto, G., Fontana, A., Choquet, Y., Bailleul, B., Falciatore, A.","raw_content_length":1326,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cyclotella"],"persons":["CRISPR-Cas"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1326,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The first photosynthetic mutant","diatoms","the subunit","plastidial ATP synthase","a key role","thylakoid electrochemical proton gradient","photosynthesis regulation","heterotrophic metabolism","Diatoms","major phytoplanktonic algae"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The first photosynthetic mutant":2.0,"diatoms":2.0,"the subunit":2.0,"plastidial ATP synthase":2.0,"a key role":2.0,"thylakoid electrochemical proton gradient":2.0,"photosynthesis regulation":2.0,"heterotrophic metabolism":2.0,"Diatoms":1.0,"major phytoplanktonic algae":1.0}},"age_hours":18.651869274722223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9047,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.0285,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0168,"disgust":0.0288},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes basic research on a photosynthetic mutant in diatoms, specifically targeting ATP synthase.

Impaired mechanical function in tendon limits mobility and results from fatigue-induced damage progression that outpaces the restorative processes maintaning tissue health, a phenomenom we term mechanopathology. Early and non-invasive detection of tendon mechanopathologies is vital to prevent further damage, but is lacking in the clinical space. Here, we evaluate the ability of diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) to detect mechanical fatigue damage in tendon, and validate our findings using histologic assessments of collagen fiber microstructure and molecular structure. We found that fatigue-induced changes in DT-MRI metrics of tendon are spatially heterogeneous, and correspond to regions with damaged collagen fiber microstructure. While secondary structures of collagen molecules were damaged by fatigue loading, they do not spatially correspond to fatigue-induced changes in DT-MRI metrics. Fatigue-induced changes in DT-MRI metrics can be partially explained by quantitative metrics of post-fatigue collagen fiber microstructure, estimating the limit of detection of DT-MRI metrics to fatigue-induced damage in tendon.

In Sri Lankas tea estate-dominated Central Highlands, a dense, widespread human population shares the landscape with the islands apex predator, the Sri Lankan leopard. This study used remote cameras to determine leopard density, generalized linear models to investigate leopard space-use in relation to key anthropogenic, ecological and environmental variables, and fitted kernel density curves to identify temporal activity patterns in this unprotected, human-dominated region. Adult leopard density (8.82/100 km{superscript 2}) was lower here than in key Sri Lankan National Parks, but not significantly so, suggesting good leopard habitat suitability. Spatially, leopards did not avoid humans but incorporated anthropogenic factors into space-use decisions, with areas of intermediate human and dog presence disproportionately used. Male leopards were more likely to occur at intermediate distances from human settlements, perhaps balancing risk with efficiency while navigating this human-dominated landscape. Female leopards biased space-use towards areas of high natural prey availability, aligning with their need to provide for cubs. Temporally, leopards were significantly less diurnal and more active at dusk than their protected counterparts, likely due to temporal partitioning from diurnally active humans, an adaptation which allows for human-leopard co-existence. This is the first comprehensive study of leopards outside protected areas in Sri Lanka, and highlights the value of unprotected landscapes and their importance for long-term leopard conservation. To foster human-leopard co-existence it is necessary to maintain current human activity patterns which allow for temporal partitioning; ensure existing natural prey resources remain to prevent leopards switching to domestic prey species; and reduce/eliminate the use of wire snares which transcend the effect of temporal partitioning by de-coupling persecution risk from human presence.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681667v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:35:12.538295","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":298,"author":"Kittle, A.

However, data on the array of inflammatory mediators to target and the immunomodulatory drugs to use are limited. This study aimed to determine key cytokines associated with HSV-induced neuroinflammation, brain injury, and clinical outcomes, and the effect of dexamethasone on their blood levels. We profiled the levels of forty-eight cytokines and four brain injury biomarkers (GFAP, NFL, Tau and UCHL-1) in CSF and serum samples collected from HSE adult patients; recruited in a randomised clinical trial to receive either adjunctive dexamethasone plus intravenous aciclovir or aciclovir alone. We found that cytokines of the IL-1 superfamily (IL-1, IL-18, IL-1RA) and IL-6 were most consistently associated with neuroinflammation, brain injury and poor clinical outcomes. Spearman correlation analysis revealed positive associations between CSF concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-18, and IL-10 and serum concentrations of IL-1RA and IL-6 with the astrocytic marker, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Levels of CSF IL-1RA and IL-18 were associated with increased volume of cerebral oedema on MRI and were significantly raised (p < 0.05) in both patients with abnormal GCS scores (< 15) and worse outcomes (LoS <3). Moreover, the blood levels of these key mediators were unaffected by adjunctive dexamethasone treatment. Taken together, this work identified key targets for direct, targeted adjunctive anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective therapy to be taken forward in clinical trials, aiming to improve outcomes following HSE.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681150v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:35:12.538608","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Egbe, F.

Methods: In a within-subject resting-state fMRI study, we examined how acute total sleep deprivation (TSD) and chronic sleep restriction (CSR) alter intrinsic functional brain organization in 28 healthy adults scanned under three conditions: rested wakefulness (RW), after one night of TSD, and after five nights of CSR. To quantify network-level disruption, we applied graph-theoretical analyses, including a novel within-subject adaptation of the Hub Disruption Index and Covariate-Constrained Manifold Learning (CCML), an unsupervised embedding technique sensitive to subject-level covariates. Moreover, we assessed subjective sleep quality, sleepiness, and circadian traits. Results: Both TSD and CSR were associated with a consistent reorganization of graph topology relative to RW. Furthermore, direct comparisons revealed that TSD and CSR affect different brain hubs. Regional changes in degree, closeness, and clustering coefficients were most prominent in subsystems of the default mode network, frontoparietal network, and cerebellum. These differences were also captured in CCML embeddings, supporting the hypothesis that acute and chronic sleep deprivation exert divergent effects on brain connectivity. Findings were robust across graph thresholds, brain atlases, and nodal metrics. Moreover, these results were further supported by the subjective measures - sleepiness was associated with reduced network integration in RW, and circadian phenotype emerged as a key determinant of individual sensitivity to sleep loss. Conclusions: Our results show that TSD and CSR induce distinct alterations in brain functional organization, offering new insights into their neural impact.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681651v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:35:12.538934","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Scislewska, P., Cabrera Vazquez, A., Szatkowska, I., Kontrymowicz-Oginska, H., Achard, S., Domagalik, A.","raw_content_length":1861,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Hub Disruption","Covariate","CSR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1861,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Divergent disruption","brain networks","total and chronic sleep loss","a longitudinal fMRI study","TSD","CSR","Study objectives","Sleep loss","cognitive and emotional functioning","the neural consequences"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["brain networks"],"research_academic":["a longitudinal fMRI study","Study objectives"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Divergent disruption":2.0,"brain networks":2.0,"total and chronic sleep loss":2.0,"a longitudinal fMRI study":2.0,"TSD":2.0,"CSR":2.0,"Study objectives":1.0,"Sleep loss":1.0,"cognitive and emotional functioning":1.0,"the neural consequences":1.0}},"age_hours":18.651927805000003,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.524,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8952,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6124,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.0812,"sadness":0.0784,"fear":0.1388,"anger":0.0252,"disgust":0.0498},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a study on the neural impact of sleep deprivation, not a climate-related technology.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_155ca830d756","title":"(Re)defining the human chromatome: an integrated meta","content":"The full complement of chromatin-associated proteins -- collectively referred to as the chromatome -- enables genome functioning in eukaryotes by participating in a wide range of physico-chemical processes. These include mediating diverse specific and non-specific intermolecular interactions, catalyzing in situ synthesis and modification of macromolecules, facilitating ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, etc. Despite considerable progress in epigenomics and the structural characterization of many nuclear proteins and their complexes, our understanding of chromatin organization at the proteome scale remains incomplete. This gap hinders the development of a holistic view of genome regulation. In this study, we present a state-of-the-art characterization of the human chromatome based on an integrative meta-analysis of diverse data sources describing the composition, abundance, and sub-nuclear localization of chromatin proteins. This effort is complemented by original analyses of their physico-chemical properties, domain architectures, and interaction patterns. To support and streamline these analyses, we developed a reference dataset of chromatin proteins, integrated with an empirical, function-based classification ontology and an associated interactive web resource - SimChrom - accessible at https://simchrom.intbio.org/. The reference dataset was carefully curated by reconciling data among protein databases, localization, and mass spectrometry-based experimental studies. Sequence-based and AI-assisted structural analyses revealed previously unannotated domains within chromatin proteins that warrant experimental validation, as well as the widespread use of multivalent interaction strategies that underpin chromatin organization. Together, our findings establish a robust framework for future studies aimed at elucidating genome function through detailed analysis of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions within chromatin.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.680841v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:35:12.539241","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Gribkova, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_12055d13a8fb","title":"Effector Repertoire and Host Transcriptomic Responses in the Tripartite Interaction Between the bloom","content":"Parasitic interactions play a central role in shaping phytoplankton community dynamics. Understanding the host response is crucial to fully comprehend these interactions. In this article, we investigate the tripartite interaction between the bloom-forming centric diatom Coscinodiscus granii, its oomycete parasite Lagenisma coscinodisci, and a co-occurring heterotrophic flagellate (Pteridomonas sp.). A major challenge in infection transcriptomics is that cells are often at different infection stages. To overcome this, we manually sorted C. granii cells at comparable infection stages to perform transcriptomic analyses. We assembled the first transcriptomes of both C. granii and L. coscinodisci. Our analysis reveals a sophisticated effector repertoire in L. coscinodisci, including canonical oomycete virulence factors such as Crinklers, RxLR effectors, cystatins, and transposon-associated proteins, as well as components of the RNAi machinery (Argonaute, Dicer, RdRP) and cyclophilins. Notably, C. granii exhibits a transcriptional response involving proteases and exosome-related pathways, suggesting a deeply conserved, possibly ancient, mechanism of defense. In parallel, we analyzed the differential expression of Pteridomonas, which consistently co-occurred in culture, and identified a distinct transcriptional profile characterized by the upregulation of motility genes, highlighting a striking mobility strategy. Thanks to the exceptionally large host size, together with available transcriptomic and metabolomic data, this tripartite system provides a unique marine model to study oomycete-diatoms interactions.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681168v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:35:12.539537","language":"en","tags":["preprints","biology","cutting-edge","life-sciences","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Orvain, C., Bertrand, L., Porcel, B.
