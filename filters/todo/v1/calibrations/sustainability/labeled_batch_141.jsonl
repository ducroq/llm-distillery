However, standard models of mosquito-borne disease transmission inherently assume that mosquitoes bite only once per reproductive cycle -- an assumption commonly violated in nature. Drivers of multiple biting also affect the mosquito gonotrophic cycle duration (GCD), the quantity customarily used to estimate biting rates. Here, we present a novel framework for incorporating more complex mosquito biting behaviors into transmission models, accounting for heterogeneity and linkages between mosquito biting rates and multiple biting. We provide general formulas for the basic offspring number, $\\mathcal{N}_0$, and basic reproduction number, $\\mathcal{R}_0$, threshold measures for mosquito population and pathogen transmission persistence, respectively. To exhibit its flexibility, we expand on specific models derived from the framework that arise from empirical, phenomenological, or mechanistic modeling perspectives. Using the gonotrophic cycle duration as a standard quantity to make comparisons among the models, we show that assumptions about the biting process strongly affect the relationship between GCD and $\\mathcal{R}_0$. While under the standard assumption of one bite per reproductive cycle, $\\mathcal{R}_0$ is an increasing linear function of the inverse of the GCD, alternative models of the biting process can exhibit saturating or concave relationships. Critically, from a mechanistic perspective, decreases in the GCD can lead to substantial decreases in $\\mathcal{R}_0$. This work highlights the importance of incorporating the behavioral dynamics of mosquitoes into transmission models and provides a method for evaluating how individual-level interventions against mosquito biting scale up to determine population-level mosquito-borne disease risk.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10585","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.483235","language":"en","tags":["mathds","q-biope","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":265,"author":"Kyle J. -M.

While this duality has been rigorously formulated for the closed topological string sector, the open string sector remains less understood. Building on the results of [1-3], we make further progress in this direction by constructing entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the quantized mirror curve from open topological string partition functions. We focus on local $\\mathbb{F}_0$, whose mirror curve corresponds to the Baxter equation of the two-particle, relativistic Toda lattice. We then study the standard and dual four-dimensional limits, where the quantum mirror curve for local $\\mathbb{F}_0$ degenerates into the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, respectively. In these limits, our framework provides a way to construct entire, off-shell eigenfunctions for the difference equations associated with these operators. Furthermore, we find a simple relation between the on-shell eigenfunctions of the modified Mathieu and McCoy-Tracy-Wu operators, leading to a functional relation between the operators themselves.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21762","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.484046","language":"en","tags":["mathsp","preprints","hep-th","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Matijn Fran\\c{c}ois, Alba Grassi","raw_content_length":1303,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Toda","McCoy-Tracy-Wu"],"persons":["Baxter","Mathieu","Calabi-Yau"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\mathbb{F}_0$"]},"char_count":1302,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the open TSST correspondence","arXiv250321762v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","The topological stringspectral theory correspondence","a precise non-perturbative duality","topological strings","local Calabi-Yau threefolds","the spectral theory","quantized mirror curves","this duality"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the open TSST correspondence":2.0,"arXiv250321762v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The topological stringspectral theory correspondence":1.0,"a precise non-perturbative duality":1.0,"topological strings":1.0,"local Calabi-Yau threefolds":1.0,"the spectral theory":1.0,"quantized mirror curves":1.0,"this duality":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792268879166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9062,"joy":0.0134,"surprise":0.0147,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0282,"anger":0.0195,"disgust":0.0119},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research in mathematical physics.

Under this kind of selective reporting, conventional treatment effect estimates may be biased and their corresponding confidence intervals may undercover the true effect sizes. We propose new estimators and confidence intervals that provide valid inferences on the effect sizes of the significant effects after multiple hypothesis testing. Our methods are based on the principle of selective conditional inference and complement a wide range of tests, including step-up tests and bootstrap-based step-down tests. Our approach is scalable, allowing us to study an application with over 370 estimated effects. We justify our procedure for asymptotically normal treatment effect estimators. We provide two empirical examples that demonstrate bias correction and confidence interval adjustments for significant effects. The magnitude and direction of the bias correction depend on the correlation structure of the estimated effects and whether the interpretation of the significant effects depends on the (in)significance of other effects.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22369","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.484431","language":"en","tags":["econem","mathst","preprints","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Andreas Dzemski, Ryo Okui, Wenjie Wang","raw_content_length":1267,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["arXiv:2503.22369v2 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1266,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Inference","effect size","multiple hypothesis testing","arXiv250322369v2 Announce Type","Significant treatment effects","empirical findings","studies","possibly many treatment effects","this kind","selective reporting"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Inference":2.0,"effect size":2.0,"multiple hypothesis testing":2.0,"arXiv250322369v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Significant treatment effects":1.0,"empirical findings":1.0,"studies":1.0,"possibly many treatment effects":1.0,"this kind":1.0,"selective reporting":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792283139722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.221,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8442,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7804,"joy":0.0096,"surprise":0.0649,"sadness":0.0183,"fear":0.0417,"anger":0.0488,"disgust":0.0363},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new statistical method for analyzing treatment effects, potentially applicable to sustainability studies.

Our algorithm implements an isometry between the occupation number basis of a fermionic Fock space of $2d$ modes, and the Gelfand-Tsetlin (GT) states spanning irreducible representations of the group $U(d) \\times SU(2)$. The latter forms a basis indexed by well-defined values of total particle number $N$, global spin $S$, spin projection $M$, and $U(d)$ GT patterns. This realises the antisymmetric unitary-unitary duality discovered by Howe and developed into the Unitary Group Approach (UGA) for computational chemistry by Paldus and Shavitt in the 1970s. The Paldus transform lends tools from the UGA readily applicable to quantum computational chemistry, leading to maximally sparse representations of spin-free Hamiltonians, efficient preparation of Configuration State Functions, and a direct interpretation of quantum chemistry reduced density matrix elements in terms of $SU(2)$ angular momentum coupling. The transform also enables the encoding of quantum information into novel Decoherence-Free Subsystems for use in communication and error mitigation. Our work can be seen as a generalisation of the quantum Schur transform for the second quantisation, made tractable by the Pauli exclusion principle. Alongside self-contained derivations of the underlying dualities we provide fault-tolerant circuit compilation methods with full gate counts for the Paldus transform, resulting in $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ Toffoli complexity, where a transform on $50$ spatial orbitals would require a modest $5500$ Toffoli gates.

While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving nonabelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multidimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to nonabelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of nonabelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of nonabelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.488513","language":"en","tags":["preprints","hep-th","math-ph","mathmp","cond-matstr-el","cond-matstat-mech","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan","raw_content_length":1613,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GSF","Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons","SET","the multidimensional internal gauge spaces"],"persons":["Hu-Geer-Wu","Symmetry arXiv:2506.24115v2 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1612,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation","Nonabelian Anyons","Symmetry","SET","nonabelian anyons","replace-cross Abstract","intrinsic topological order","global symmetries","rise","novel symmetry phenomena"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation":2.0,"Nonabelian Anyons":2.0,"Symmetry":2.0,"SET":2.0,"nonabelian anyons":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"intrinsic topological order":1.0,"global symmetries":1.0,"rise":1.0,"novel symmetry phenomena":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7924335816666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8991,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.0192,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.03,"anger":0.0185,"disgust":0.0194},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":8,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on symmetry-enriched topological phases and their potential application in topological quantum computation.

Until now, statistically consistent inference methods have been limited to phylogenetic level-1 networks, which allow no interdependence between reticulate events. In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for a statistically consistent inference method for a much broader class: semi-directed level-2 networks that are outer-labeled planar and galled. We precisely characterize the features of these networks that are distinguishable from the topologies of their displayed quartet trees. Moreover, we prove that an inter-taxon distance derived from these quartets is circular decomposable, enabling future robust inference of these networks from quartet data, such as concordance factors obtained from gene tree distributions under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model. Our results also have novel identifiability implications across different data types and evolutionary models, applying to any setting in which displayed quartets can be distinguished.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17308","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.489327","language":"en","tags":["q-biope","mathco","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Niels Holtgrefe, Elizabeth S.

We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08639","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.490527","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","hep-th","mathqa","math-ph","cond-matstr-el","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Yoshiki Fukusumi, Shinichiro Yahagi","raw_content_length":1264,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["arXiv:2508.08639v3 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["Z_{N}$"]},"char_count":1263,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["fusion rules","finite subgroups","a general understanding","quotient","gauging","replace-cross Abstract","a general method","simple current extensions","the conformal field theories","the Z_N symmetry extended fusion ring"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"fusion rules":2.0,"finite subgroups":2.0,"a general understanding":2.0,"quotient":2.0,"gauging":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"a general method":1.0,"simple current extensions":1.0,"the conformal field theories":1.0,"the Z_N symmetry extended fusion ring":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792505137777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8417,"joy":0.0319,"surprise":0.0326,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0234,"anger":0.0473,"disgust":0.0184},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research in conformal field theories and their potential applications in topological quantum field theories.

The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\\infty\\in \\mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones.

We investigated presynaptic morphology and two key presynaptic proteins: MYCBP2; and the Active Zone (AZ) protein ELKS. Primary rat cortical neurons were transfected with wildtype -Syn, or the familial A30P mutant, and nanoscopic changes to bouton morphology and protein localisation were investigated using super-resolution microscopy. Variant specific accumulation patterns for overexpressed -Syn were observed without changes to bouton structure. Additionally, increases of both -Syn variants affected presynaptic proteins, decreasing MYCBP2 puncta count and intensity, and reducing ELKS protein density. Since MYCBP2 potentially regulates ELKS, these findings suggest that elevated -Syn perturbs AZ components whilst presynaptic structure is preserved. Our study supports growing evidence that increased -Syn disturbs presynaptic function potentially through a MYCBP2-ELKS axis, a mechanism which may provide a valuable target for PD therapeutics.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681706v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.566751","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Watson, I.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_d5259c45b5a6","title":"Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of tank-water administered BRAF","content":"Zebrafish models are widely used to study the biology of BRAF-mutant melanoma. However, long-term treatment of adult fish with small molecule BRAF inhibitors is challenging, limiting the usefulness of this model to study treatment-induced effects in melanoma biology. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies on small molecule inhibitors in zebrafish that could inform rational dosing strategies, are largely lacking. Here, we have assessed the pharmacokinetics, metabolism and efficacy of continuous tank water -administered BRAF-inhibitor dabrafenib in adult zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that dabrafenib is quickly absorbed from the tank water, reaching efficacious plasma levels within one hour following treatment, but also shows fast elimination kinetics with a half-life of 1.6 hours. We could detect most of the human metabolites of dabrafenib in zebrafish, suggesting that dabrafenib metabolism in zebrafish follows a similar process as in humans. Continuous tank water -administered dabrafenib led to therapeutically relevant steady-state plasma levels that inhibited the BRAF-driven signaling and growth in zebrafish melanoma cells in vitro, and resulted in robust in vivo efficacy in a genetic zebrafish model of BRAF-mutant melanoma, with no apparent toxicity. Together, our results demonstrate that continuous tank water -administered dabrafenib provides a feasible, efficient, and well-tolerated dosing strategy to study treatment-related effects in zebrafish models of BRAF-mutant melanoma. We expect that tank water-administration may also facilitate the dosing of other small molecule inhibitors, especially those with short in vivo half-life in zebrafish.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681850v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.568995","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Villman, J., Dibus, N., Huhn, J., Haapalainen-Saaristo, A.-M., Evstafev, I., Dickens, A., Scherf-Clavel, O., Paatero, I., Kurppa, K.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_8c7fdcc8c662","title":"Hypoxia Imaging as a Radiomics Signature in Tumors Using Novel 19F","content":"The ability to accurately identify and characterize regions of hypoxia has been an active area of study due to the biological ramifications of low oxygen tension in different pathological conditions, including inflammation, infections, wound healing, cardiovascular conditions, kidney and pulmonary diseases, hepatic and neurological toxicities, and cancer. Although hypoxia contributes a significant role in these conditions, the ability to accurately and instantaneously monitor the presence of hypoxia in vivo and correlate comprehensive analysis of hypoxia-dependent molecular signatures in response to treatments regimens is lacking. With the advent of hypoxia-responsive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including the recent development and characterization by our team of a novel probe that involves both 19F and EuII, the capability to integrate direct hypoxia imaging in real-time with new technologies that enable spatial transcriptomic profiling has become a possibility. To assess the capability of this agent for studying hypoxia, we used osteosarcoma as a model. In this preliminary study we demonstrate two major results: First, we show that convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a reliable and robust methodology to distribute MRI contrast agents throughout a tumor. Second, we show that integration of direct hypoxia-detecting imaging modalities and spatial biology enables real-time in vivo insights into biology and identification of biomarkers directly applicable to disease development and response to therapy. The ability to identify and define hypoxia-mediated biology using direct rather than indirect MRI methods has extremely significant implications in the care of a wide-range of pathological conditions.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_4183adb0e4b6","title":"Large field of view fluorescence imaging of microfluidic devices with a tandem","content":"Microfluidic devices enable high-throughput sample processing with remarkable parallelization and miniaturization. While fluorescence microscopy provides a convenient method for reading out signal from microfluidic assays, commercially-available microscopes impose a fundamental tradeoff between temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and numerical aperture (NA). Spatially tiled imaging enables high-resolution and high-NA imaging over a large area but reduces temporal resolution. Conversely, low magnification, low NA imaging captures large areas in one shot, but typically sacrifices spatial resolution and fluorescence sensitivity. To address this, we introduce an automated transfluorescence tandem-macro-lens optomechanical system (macroscope) capable of sensitive, multi-channel fluorescence imaging over a very large field of view (34 mm diameter, 740 mm2), with resolution determined by the sensor pixel size. We demonstrate bright-field resolution of low-micron features and detection of low- to mid-nanomolar concentrations of common fluorophores within microfluidic device channels. To demonstrate the utility of this macroscope, we image enzyme turnover within valved microfluidic devices (the HT-MEK system, for High-Throughput Microfluidic Enzyme Kinetics) and achieve >50-fold increased temporal resolution over common commercial instruments while maintaining high sensitivity. This macroscope imaging solution costs substantially less than commercially available alternatives, providing a powerful new imaging approach for microfluidic applications requiring sensitive and rapid wide-field fluorescence imaging.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.680838v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.569606","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Mokhtari, D.

To advance the development of a comprehensive pangenome reference, we present new de novo genome assemblies of two genetically and ecologically distinct lines: Whale Rock (WR; wild, landlocked, Central California) and Keithley Creek (KC; wild, resident, interior Columbia Basin), along with the previously published assemblies of the Arlee (domesticated, Northern California) and Swanson (semi-domesticated, resident, Alaska) lines. All assemblies provide nearly complete coverage of known genes (BUSCO 95.8-99.7%) and are similar in genome size (~2.3 Gb), with scaffold N50 values between 3.4 Mb (KC) and 52.4 Mb (Swanson). Comparative whole-genome alignments revealed high sequence conservation (97-98% identity) among assemblies, but also evidence of extensive structural variation of at least 50 bp in length. Structural variant (SV) profiling identified tens of thousands of deletions, insertions, and complex rearrangements largely in noncoding sequences. In an initial assessment of the utility of having multiple de novo genome assemblies for rainbow trout, we found that two strains (Arlee and Swanson; domesticated) share SVs enriched in genes linked with growth, reproduction, and adaptation to domestication, such as GTP binding and ECM-receptor interaction. In comparison, the other two strains (WR and KC; wild origin) share SVs associated with reproductive timing such as GnRH signaling pathway. Both Arlee and WR also have unique SVs potentially related to their geographic origin and unique life history. Additionally, we identified SVs in key regions, such as a QTL for fillet yield on Omy17 and the maturation-associated SIX6/ER{beta}-GPHB5 locus on Omy25q, suggesting the importance of considering SVs when investigating the genomics of complex traits. Together, these assemblies and comparative analyses establish a foundation for a rainbow trout pangenome reference, illuminating how they can be utilized to reveal the structural genomic basis of domestication, adaptation, and other complex traits in O. mykiss.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681701v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.570314","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":306,"author":"Ali, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_b364be593710","title":"One","content":"The pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor) is a critically endangered primate with a small geographic range that includes fragmented urban forest mosaics in Amazonia, where habitat subdivision and anthropogenic actions complicate its survival and monitoring. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a convenient, noninvasive way to track this species, yet open-set rainforest soundscapes make single-species detection challenging. We present a machine-learning pipeline with a very low false-positive rate, appropriate for downstream inference. The method combines a band-pass filter (5-10 kHz), Perch bioacoustic embeddings (deep learning), and a One-Class SVM (OCSVM) applied to sliding windows of continuous audio recordings to detect S. bicolor calls. We train on a reduced dataset of labeled calls and validate against diverse out-of-class audio (birds, anurans, anthropophony, and geophony/insects), then test on long, cross-site recordings. The approach achieves high discrimination on held-out negatives and produces very low false-positive rates in realistic, continuous audio. Finally, we pair detections with a single-site occupancy model in a cross-site setting to illustrate end-to-end utility for conservation monitoring and to estimate the false-negative detection probability in recordings from pied tamarin populations in a different geographic region. Our strategy provides a tool for PAM of S. bicolor that requires minimal manual labeling effort and can be adapted to other open-set, single-species monitoring scenarios. We also release a convenient Python package (https://pypi.org/project/sauim-detector/), installable via pip, that processes an audio file and produces detection timestamps as an Audacity label file (.txt), enabling faster manual verification.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681843v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.570624","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Colonna, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c0b2eab72a71","title":"MIC*: A Framework for Interpretable Analysis of Ordinal Viability Data","content":"Microbial survival assays frequently use ordered categorical (ordinal) scores, such as semi-quantitative viability scores across drug concentrations. While these ordinal data provide rich information about dose-response dynamics, they require appropriate statistical approaches for proper analysis. Proportional-odds (PO) ordinal regression is specifically designed for such data, modeling the ordered nature of scores while accommodating continuous variables such as concentration. However, despite its advantages, PO regression remains underutilized in microbiology because its cumulative log-odds outputs are abstract and biologically unintuitive. Consequently, researchers often resort to flawed alternatives: collapsing scores into binary outcomes (growth/no growth), treating scores as continuous values for t-tests or ANOVA, or applying nonparametric tests that ignore dose-response structure. Each approach sacrifices power or validity, risking unreliable conclusions. To allow researchers to better leverage the power of ordinal datasets, we introduce MIC*, a summary measure that translates PO regression results into biologically interpretable units. MIC* is defined as the treatment concentration where the predicted probability of \"no viability\" equals 0.5, and is thus conceptually related to the minimum inhibitory dose (MIC) widely used in antimicrobial research. MIC* retains the rigor of ordinal regression while providing more biologically intuitive effect size measures. The MIC* framework enables formal comparisons as absolute differences ({Delta}MIC*) or relative fold-changes ({Delta}log2MIC*), allowing for robust statistical comparisons between samples. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that MIC* yields robust estimates with superior power compared to conventional statistical methods, while case studies demonstrate practical utility. To ensure wide adoption, we provide a suite of open-source tools: a BLInded Scoring System (BLISS) for generating ordinal viability scores, and web-based (MICalculator) and R package (ordinalMIC) alternatives for performing complete MIC* analyses, thus reducing barriers to appropriate analysis of ordinal phenotypes in microbiology.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682067v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.571500","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":280,"author":"Stacy, C.

The reasons for this disparity are not fully understood. Given the role of the gut microbiome in immune development, we investigated the relationship between the gut microbiome and polio vaccine seroconversion in children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included children ages 6-24 months old (n=90) enrolled in the DRC. Vaccine history was obtained from health records and/or self-report and poliovirus serostatus surveyed using dried blood spots. Nutritional status was evaluated using anthropomorphic measures. Microbiome profiling (16S rRNA gene) was performed and associations with poliovirus serostatus and malnutrition were examined. Results: The average age of the study population was 13.6 months (SD=5.6) with 58% female. Poliovirus seropositivity was 65.5% and 22% of the children were malnourished. We found that presence of Campylobacter and Veillonella, especially at an early age, was associated with low poliovirus vaccination seroconversion. These bacterial taxa differed from those associated with malnutrition.

Exposure of the CRISPRi libraries to four mechanistically distinct antibiotics revealed genome-wide susceptibility profiles, identifying both strain-dependent and conserved susceptibility signatures shaped by the drug mode of action and genetic background. Analysis of these conserved vulnerabilities provided insight into antibiotic-specific stress responses and resistance mechanisms. Among the core determinants of vancomycin vulnerability, we identified several previously uncharacterized genes, including a conserved membrane-associated operon, here designated EsrABC, whose disruption markedly increases vancomycin sensitivity in the four strains. Our study provides a genome-wide atlas of S. aureus fitness and conditional vulnerabilities, fully explorable in the here-developed online AureoBrowse platform (https://aureobrowse.veeninglab.com/), revealing candidates for synergistic therapies and potential therapeutic targets.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682098v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.572309","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"mazzuoli, m. v., Burnier, J., Schmid, A., Martin, L., Janssen, A.

Previously published mathematical model-based simulations of randomly searching for an infection T cells, assuming that T cells move in open (3D) space or on a regular lattice, suggested that some degree of attraction is needed for cells to find the infection. Yet, in our previous experiments we failed to find evidence of attraction towards the infection in most T cells. Because the movement of liver-localized T cells is confined to sinusoids, the blood vessels of the liver, T cells may in fact be attracted to the infection site via the sinusoids. In new experiments we imaged Plasmodium-specific CD8 T cells, sporozoites, and liver sinusoids simultaneously. We also developed a new method to model imaged sinusoids as graphs and to simulate movement of T cells on graphs, and new tests to detect biased cell movement on graphs. As before, our previously published open space/3D-based metric suggested that few T cells are attracted to the infection site in presence of moderate cluster of T cells. However, with our new graph-based metric we could not detect attraction when constraining T cell movement to sinusoids. Surprisingly, simulations of T cells searching for an infection via liver sinusoids showed that a relatively small number of T cells (1 cell/imaging volume or <10^5 cell/liver), moving without attraction at experimentally observed speeds, is sufficient to find the infection within 24 hours, well below the expected lifespan of the Plasmodium liver stage in mice. Our results suggest that the constrained environment of the tissue structure makes a random search more effective, and that detecting T cell attraction towards specific areas may arise as an artifact of metrics designed for open space/3D. Our results thus call for a re-evaluation of the implicit assumption that attraction is necessary for T cells to find infections in tissues.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681610v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.572643","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":314,"author":"Zenkov, V.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_49e9c3d6c74e","title":"Cell-type","content":"Flexible behavioral responses rely on the ability of neural circuits to adapt their physiology and output to changing social and environmental contexts. Neuromodulation plays a central role in this flexibility, dynamically tuning neuronal activity and gene expression to align behavior with experience and internal states. Yet how specific experiences and motivational conditions are encoded within neuromodulatory neurons remains underexplored. Here, we show that distinct motivational outcomes drive discrete, largely non-overlapping transcriptional programs across three neuromodulatory neuronal populations in male Drosophila brains. Using cell-type-resolved RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of serotonergic (Trh), octopaminergic/tyraminergic (Tdc2), and neuropeptide F receptor (NPFR) neurons under three conditions: successful mating, sexual rejection, and the absence of social or sexual interaction. Each experience induced a unique molecular engram within specific neuron types. NPFR neurons exhibited the strongest transcriptional remodeling following rejection, Tdc2 neurons preferentially represented the single state, and Trh neurons displayed balanced, experience-specific tuning. Shared differentially expressed genes across neuronal classes were few and often were oppositely regulated, revealing divergent circuit-specific logic. Experience triggered multilayered reprogramming across chromatin organization, RNA metabolism, translation, proteostasis and synaptic machinery, with selective recalibration of vesicle trafficking, and neuroplasticity. We further identified a compact, cross-circuit rejection core enriched for circadian, stress, metabolic, neuropeptidergic, and synaptic components. Together, these findings demonstrate how neuromodulatory circuits translate social experience into coordinated molecular and synaptic adaptations that enable behavioral flexibility.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681849v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.572934","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Ryvkin, J., Shmueli, A., Aharony, A., Levi, M., Shohat-Ophir, G.","raw_content_length":1909,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Drosophila","NPFR","RNA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1909,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cell-type","Flexible behavioral responses","the ability","neural circuits","their physiology","output","social and environmental contexts","Neuromodulation","a central role","this flexibility"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cell-type":2.0,"Flexible behavioral responses":1.0,"the ability":1.0,"neural circuits":1.0,"their physiology":1.0,"output":1.0,"social and environmental contexts":1.0,"Neuromodulation":1.0,"a central role":1.0,"this flexibility":1.0}},"age_hours":30.793695136944443,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2865,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8573,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9463,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.0182,"sadness":0.003,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0093,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms of behavioral adaptation in Drosophila, specifically how different experiences alter gene expression in neuromodulatory neurons.

We developed Cell-type Oriented Massively Parallel reporter Assay of Splicing Signatures (COMPASS) to measure splicing outcomes for 87,546 single and double variants across more than 1,700 genes in five human cell lines of diverse tissue origin. COMPASS targets disease relevant gene sets, including ACMG actionable genes and SFARI autism-associated genes, enabling systematic dissection of splicing impacts in health and disease. Our measurements reveal numerous SDVs, including ClinVar variants currently classified as variants of uncertain significance. Using prime editing, we validate variant effects in the genome for ClinVar variants in BIN1, a gene implicated in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and cardiac pathology. Benchmarking our MPRA against state-of-the-art predictive models shows that while these approaches capture broad variant effects, important gaps remain. Our data reveal putative RNA-binding protein motifs whose disruption drives splicing changes, providing mechanistic insight into variant impact. Finally, cross-cell line comparisons reveal a distinct subset of variants that drive cell type-specific splicing programs.

This process occurs within chromatin and although accurate repair requires extensive changes in chromatin structure and composition, chromatin effectors facilitating DSB repair remain largely unknown in plants. Using reverse genetics, we identified two chromatin readers, YAF9A and YAF9B, as new factors required for DSB repair in Arabidopsis. While only YAF9B is induced by DNA damage, both YAF9A and YAF9B are required for DSB repair, including via homologous recombination (HR)-like pathways. Mechanistically, we found YAF9A and YAF9B denote distinct remodeling complexes: While YAF9A associates with both NuA4 and SWR1, YAF9B only associates with NuA4, defining a DNA-damage-specific version of this remodeling complex and revealing the first link between NuA4 and DSB repair in plants. We also uncovered direct roles for YAF9A and YAF9B in DNA repair, rather than indirect roles in gene regulation, as yaf9 mutants showed normal transcriptional responses to DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that the YAF9B reader domain is required for DSB repair. These results link YAF9A, YAF9B, and their respective remodeling complexes, to DSB repair in a histone reader-dependent manner, expanding our understanding of how chromatin effectors regulate DSB repair in plants.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681831v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.574122","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Law, J.

Here, we identify that some of these immune response are differentially executed in leaves of different ages in the same plant. We observed that when compared to mature leaves, young, expanding leaves do not close their plasmodesmata, have a reduced transcriptional response to immune elicitors, and are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen. Disconnecting leaf age from physiology, we determined that both plasmodesmal closure and the magnitude of transcriptional responses are dependent on whether the leaf is a carbon sink or a carbon source. To probe the relevance of differential regulation of plasmodesmata in sink and source tissues, we forced plasmodesmal closure in young sink leaves and found this perturbed the normal outputs of growth and defence. Thus, we propose that sink leaves do not close their plasmodesmata during immune reponses to prioritise carbon use for growth over defence, and consequently that primary metabolism underpins different immune response profiles in different leaves of the same plant.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681807v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.574394","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Raven, E.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_db1d8b60ced8","title":"CoxMDS: Multiple Data Splitting for High","content":"Causal mediation analysis investigates whether the effect of an exposure on an outcome operates through intermediate variables known as mediators. Although progress has been made in high-dimensional mediation analysis, current methods do not reliably control the false discovery rate (FDR) in finite samples, especially when mediators are moderately to highly correlated or follow non-Gaussian distributions. These challenges frequently arise in DNA methylation studies. We introduce CoxMDS, a multiple data splitting method that uses Cox proportional hazards models to identify putative causal mediators for survival outcomes. CoxMDS ensures finite-sample FDR control even in the presence of correlated or non-Gaussian mediators. Through simulations, CoxMDS is shown to maintain FDR control and achieve higher statistical power compared with existing approaches. In applications to DNA methylation data with survival outcomes, CoxMDS identified eight CpG sites in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA methylation may mediate the effect of smoking on lung cancer survival, and two CpG sites in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA methylation may mediate the effect of smoking on time to Alzheimer's disease conversion.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681836v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.574688","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Yao, M., Tian, P., Li, X., Bian, S., Wang, G., Gu, Y., Navas-Acien, A., Vardarajan, B.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_84ef6ce216e9","title":"Bioinformatic inference of the exercise","content":"Previous research suggests that the absolute levels of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) are a key determinant of the rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis (MPS). p70S6K levels are in part determined by the transcriptional control of the gene encoding p70S6K, RPS6KB1, but the molecular mechanisms governing its expression are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to infer the molecular regulatory network governing RPS6KB1 expression. We applied a novel bioinformatic network inference algorithm called CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) to infer the signaling network downstream of canonical exercise sensors controlling RPS6KB1-specific transcription factors (TFs) after acute aerobic (AE) or resistance exercise (RE). CARNIVAL integrates a prior knowledge network, TF and signaling pathway activities inferred from transcriptomic data, and perturbation targets to predict the network that best explains the data. The networks revealed intracellular sensors and hormone receptors controlling RPS6KB1-specific TFs. Both exercise types resulted in AMPK-mediated SNAI1 regulation, but HIF1A was distinctly controlled (AE: PHD1-3, FIH; RE: AMPK). AE controlled FOXA1 via insulin, TGF-{beta}, and myostatin signalling, while RE controlled CEBPA via MAP3Ks. Our study is the first to apply a comprehensive bioinformatic network inference algorithm to infer causal exercise-responsive signaling networks. The results of our analysis motivate experimentally testable hypotheses pertaining to the molecular control of RPS6KB1 transcription in human skeletal muscle in response to aerobic and resistance exercise.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681841v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:55.574973","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cutting-edge","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"McColl, T.
