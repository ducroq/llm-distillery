Ilja Mazar uit Düsseldorf wist binnen een uur tijd 1651 keer met zijn borst de grond te raken. Dat zijn ruim 27 van zulke chest-to-ground-push-ups per minuut. Mazar staat nu twee keer in het Guinness Book of World Records. In mei had hij al het record voor gewone push-ups aangescherpt naar 1950 in een uur. De influencer en fotograaf Mazar begon twee jaar geleden met het dagelijks oefenen van push-ups. Hij begon met vijftig keer, inmiddels zit hij bij zijn dagelijkse trainingen op duizend of meer. Mazar had na afloop kramp in de benen en overal spierpijn, schrijft de Duitse omroep WDR, die bij de recordpoging was. Toch had Mazar alweer zin in een nieuwe uitdaging. Hij wil nog meer push-up-records vestigen, dan met gewichten op zijn lichaam.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586273","published_date":"2025-10-13T01:04:52","collected_date":"2025-10-13T01:55:21.111355","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":140,"author":null,"raw_content_length":998,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.7,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["WDR","Guinness Book"],"persons":["World Records","Ilja Mazar","Mazar"],"locations":["Düsseldorf"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":825,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["wereldrecord","extra zware push","een uur","keer","Een Duitse man","een nieuw wereldrecord","tijd","zijn borst","de grond","Dat"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"wereldrecord":2.0,"extra zware push":2.0,"een uur":2.0,"keer":2.0,"Een Duitse man":1.0,"een nieuw wereldrecord":1.0,"tijd":1.0,"zijn borst":1.0,"de grond":1.0,"Dat":1.0}},"age_hours":0.9429694088888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6782,"joy":0.0147,"surprise":0.178,"sadness":0.0377,"fear":0.032,"anger":0.0322,"disgust":0.0271},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a man setting a push-up world record.

Volgens het kabinet waren er \"acute signalen van ernstige bestuurlijke tekortkomingen en handelingen\" bij het chipbedrijf. Het ministerie wil daar verder geen details over geven. In een persbericht zegt het ministerie dat er een dreiging was van een kennislek en een mogelijk risico voor de Nederlandse en Europese economische veiligheid.

Zo schrijft het ministerie dat \"beslissingen binnen het bedrijf kunnen worden tegengehouden of teruggedraaid als deze schadelijk zouden zijn\". Nexperia maakt chips die onder meer worden gebruikt in auto's en in consumentenelektronica. Het is gevestigd in Nijmegen. In 2019 is het overgenomen door het Chinese concern Wingtech. Ook in Chinese media wordt gesproken over het ingrijpen door de overheid bij Nexperia. De beslissing om in te grijpen is eind vorige maand genomen. \"Dit is een wet die het kabinet alleen toepast als het echt niet anders kan\", zegt het ministerie.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_aaa8a34f6e03","title":"Mensen met albinisme strijden voor zichtbaarheid in Afrika","content":"Afrikaanse jongeren kwamen onlangs samen in Zimbabwe voor een bijzondere wedstrijd: de strijd om gekroond te worden tot Miss en Mrs Albinisme Afrika. Een avond waarbij het niet zozeer om schoonheid draaide, maar om acceptatie. Het is druk in de kleedkamer van een hotel in de hoofdstad Harare. Haren worden gekamd, gezichten gepoederd en alle kleding wordt klaargelegd, inclusief een nepleeuwenhoofd dat dient als accessoire. De kandidaten uit onder meer Angola, Botswana, Nigeria, Kenia, Sierra Leone en gastland Zimbabwe zijn gespannen. Het zijn jongeren van over het hele continent, die een ding gemeen hebben. Ze zijn allemaal geboren met albinisme, een erfelijke aandoening waarbij de aanmaak van het pigment melanine, dat kleur geeft aan huid, haar en ogen, verminderd aanwezig of zelfs afwezig is. En ze hebben daardoor allemaal te maken met uitsluiting en discriminatie. De jongeren zijn samengebracht door de Zimbabwaanse organisatie Albinism Dare to Dream Initiative, geleid door Brenda Mudzimu die ook albinisme heeft. Al jarenlang worden er landelijk soortgelijke wedstrijden georganiseerd, maar zij besloot er een continentale competitie van te maken. Het is dus voor het eerst dat er een Miss en Mrs Albinisme Afrika wordt gekozen. Geweld en werkloosheid Meer dan een schoonheidswedstrijd, is het een platform om gezien en gehoord te worden, vertelt zij. \"De noodzaak tot meer bewustwording is nog steeds groot. Ondanks antidiscriminerende wetgeving hebben mensen met albinisme te maken met geweld en velen zijn werkloos omdat ze minder makkelijk een baan kunnen krijgen vanwege vooroordelen.\" De 21-jarige Daniella Garrick is helemaal uit Sierra Leone in West-Afrika gekomen om mee te doen. \"We worden nog vaak gedemoniseerd,\" zegt Garrick. \"Zelfs als je succesvol of goed opgeleid bent, word je nog steeds beoordeeld op hoe je eruitziet. Daar worstel ik al mee sinds mijn geboorte. Het is tijd dat mensen met albinisme geaccepteerd worden.\" Ook kandidaat John Ngaita uit Kenia kent de pijn van uitsluiting. \"We worden vaak uitgescholden. Kinderen rennen achter je aan, mensen lachen of staren. Je voelt je nooit op je gemak, vooral niet als je dan bijvoorbeeld met een vriendinnetje over straat loopt.\" Rituele moorden in onder meer Malawi en Tanzania waarbij mensen met albinisme werden vermoord omdat ze geloven dat hun ledematen magische krachten hebben, maakte ook hem bang. \"Sommige mensen in Kenia op straat riepen dan: 'We kunnen je verkopen, jij bent geld waard.' Niemand verdient het om zo ontmenselijkt te worden.\" Toch blijft Ngaita hoopvol. \"In Kenia hebben we nu een parlementslid en een regeringswoordvoerder met albinisme. Er is vooruitgang.\" Maar vanavond denkt hij alleen maar aan de mogelijke kroon. \"Dit podium is mijn droom het laat zien dat we er wél toe doen.\" Het is tijd om de catwalk op te gaan in verschillende rondes, met traditionele Afrikaanse kleding en een professionele ronde, waarbij de deelnemers werkkleding dragen zoals van een dokter en een stewardess. Het publiek juicht de kandidaten toe. De jury schrijft hun scores op. Ze kijken naar charisma, zelfvertrouwen, houding, intellect, maar ook hun loopjes. \"Mensen kijken op ons neer maar ik ben een verpleegster\", zegt organisator Mudzimu in de microfoon als ze zelf op de catwalk gaat staan. \"En ik ben degene die voor jou zorgt op je sterfbed. Kijk dus niet op ons neer.\" Mudzimu hoopt dat deze wedstrijd deuren opent. \"We willen ook actie zoals betere medische zorg, want we worstelen met ons zicht. En een oplossing voor andere hele praktische problemen, want we krijgen veel sneller huidkanker.\" Overwinning Het is tijd voor de kroon. Garrick wint de titel bij de vrouwen. Ngaita krijgt niet de eerste prijs. Toch voelt het ook voor hem als een overwinning. \"Door hier te zijn, heb ik geleerd dat we allemaal met dezelfde uitdagingen te maken hebben, overal in Afrika,\" zegt Ngaita. \"Ik weet dat ik er niet alleen voor sta.\" \"Hier voelen we ons veilig,\" zegt ook winnares Garrick, met de kroon stevig en nog wat onwennig op haar hoofd tussen haar lotgenoten. \"We delen dezelfde strijd en begrijpen elkaar. Dat geeft kracht. En door hier te staan wil ik een voorbeeld zijn voor jonge meisjes met albinisme.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586249","published_date":"2025-10-12T19:32:46","collected_date":"2025-10-13T01:55:21.113659","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":675,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4450,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Afrikaanse jongeren"],"persons":["Sierra Leone","Kenia","gastland Zimbabwe"],"locations":["Zimbabwe","Botswana","Harare","Nigeria","Afrika","Angola"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4214,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mensen","albinisme","zichtbaarheid","een bijzondere wedstrijd","de strijd","Albinisme","Een avond","het","schoonheid","acceptatie"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mensen":2.0,"albinisme":2.0,"zichtbaarheid":2.0,"een bijzondere wedstrijd":1.0,"de strijd":1.0,"Albinisme":1.0,"Een avond":1.0,"het":1.0,"schoonheid":1.0,"acceptatie":1.0}},"age_hours":6.478011544444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7174,"joy":0.0244,"surprise":0.1149,"sadness":0.0343,"fear":0.0414,"anger":0.0302,"disgust":0.0373},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes an event promoting visibility and acceptance for people with albinism in Africa, highlighting the challenges they face, including violence and discrimination.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_a15bfd94003b","title":"Details bekend over verwachte vrijlating van gijzelaars morgen uit Gaza","content":"De ogen van de wereld zijn morgen gericht op Gaza, waar Hamas voor 11.00 uur Nederlandse tijd de gijzelaars die nog in leven zijn moet vrijlaten. De voorbereidingen voor deze operatie zijn in volle gang. Hier lees je wat er nu bekend is over het verloop van de beladen dag. 's Ochtends vroeg wordt de vrijlating van de levende gijzelaars verwacht. Zowel Hamas als Israël heeft dat bevestigd. Het exacte tijdstip is nog onbekend. Volgens de Israëlische coördinator die gaat over de terugkeer van gijzelaars is tussen 05.00 uur en 06.00 uur (Nederlandse tijd) een realistische optie. De voor het merendeel Israëlische gijzelaars worden op verschillende plekken in Gaza overgedragen aan medewerkers van het Rode Kruis, meldt Hamas. Er wordt geen propagandashow verwacht, zoals de vorige keer toen Hamas gijzelaars op een podium had gezet. Per konvooi naar Israël Israël verwacht dat alle twintig levende gijzelaars op één tijdstip worden vrijgelaten. De mensen worden in een konvooi van zes tot acht voertuigen van het Rode Kruis naar Israël gereden. Daar worden ze op een militaire basis herenigd met hun families, zo schrijft The Times of Israel, of als het nodig is eerst naar een ziekenhuis gebracht. Vervolgens rijden de internationale hulpverleners terug naar Gaza. Daar is het de bedoeling dat Hamas de stoffelijke overschotten van de dode gijzelaars overdraagt. Het gaat in totaal om 28 lichamen, maar Hamas heeft al gezegd dat het niet alle stoffelijke resten kan vinden binnen de gestelde deadline. Eenmaal in Israël worden de lichamen forensisch onderzocht om de identiteit vast te stellen. Onduidelijkheid over aantal lichamen Nabestaanden van enkele dode gijzelaars hebben te horen gekregen dat hun geliefde mogelijk niet morgen terugkeert. The Jerusalem Post schrijft dat op basis van anonieme Israëlische bronnen. Het is onbekend hoeveel van de mensen, die twee jaar geleden door Hamas tijdens de terreuraanslagen werden ontvoerd, voorlopig vermist zullen blijven. Er is eveneens onduidelijkheid over wanneer de bijna 2000 Palestijnse gevangenen worden vrijgelaten. Dat gebeurt volgens een woordvoerder van de Israëlische regering zodra alle gijzelaars en stoffelijke overschotten die \"worden verwacht\" in Israël zijn. Maar het is onduidelijk op hoeveel lichamen er wordt gerekend. Van 250 Palestijnse gevangenen is duidelijk dat het gaat om mensen die een levenslange celstraf uitzitten in Israëlische gevangenissen. Ze zijn bijvoorbeeld veroordeeld voor het plegen van moordaanslagen. Van de 250 mensen is vooraf een lijst met namen gepubliceerd. Palestijnen vast zonder aanklacht Van de overige 1700 Palestijnse gevangen die wachten op vrijlating, is de identiteit niet bekendgemaakt. Wel is duidelijk dat het gaat om inwoners van Gaza die vastzitten sinds oktober 2023, maar die niet worden verdacht van deelname aan de aanval door Hamas. Onder hen zijn 22 minderjarigen. Een deel van deze groep gedetineerden zit vast zonder aanklacht. In zogeheten 'administratieve detentie' kan iemand in Israël voor onbepaalde tijd worden vastgehouden op basis van geheim bewijs. Volgens mensenrechtenorganisaties maakt Israël op grote schaal misbruik van deze maatregel. Palestijnen worden vervolgd door militaire rechtbanken en hebben minder rechten dan in het civiele recht. Correspondent Nasrah Habiballah maakte eerder deze uitlegvideo over administratieve detentie: De Palestijnen die moeten worden vrijgelaten, gaan naar Gaza of de Westelijke Jordaanoever. Een deel van vertrekt naar het buitenland, zoals Qatar of Turkije. In februari weigerde Netanyahu om 600 Palestijnse gevangenen in vrijheid te stellen, die toen vrij zouden moeten komen in ruil voor een groep Israëlische gijzelaars. Als reden daarvoor gaf de premier dat Hamas, door de gijzelaars te vernederen op een podium, zich niet aan de afspraken had gehouden. Palestijnen vrezen dat Israël ook deze keer de vrijlating van gevangenen zal tegenhouden.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586241","published_date":"2025-10-12T18:32:05","collected_date":"2025-10-13T01:55:21.114810","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":593,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4311,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Ochtends","Hamas"],"locations":["Israël","Gaza"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3923,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["verwachte vrijlating","gijzelaars","die","De ogen","de wereld","Gaza","uur","Nederlandse tijd","leven","De voorbereidingen"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"verwachte vrijlating":2.0,"gijzelaars":2.0,"die":2.0,"De ogen":1.0,"de wereld":1.0,"Gaza":1.0,"uur":1.0,"Nederlandse tijd":1.0,"leven":1.0,"De voorbereidingen":1.0}},"age_hours":7.489415930277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7012,"joy":0.017,"surprise":0.101,"sadness":0.0511,"fear":0.0483,"anger":0.0524,"disgust":0.029},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a hostage release agreement between Hamas and Israel.
