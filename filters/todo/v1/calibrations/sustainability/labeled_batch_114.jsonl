In various proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis, enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on preserving critical LLM capabilities.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6b679aa9a729","title":"A Machine Learning Approach for MIDI to Guitar Tablature Conversion","content":"arXiv:2510.10619v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Guitar tablature transcription consists in deducing the string and the fret number on which each note should be played to reproduce the actual musical part. This assignment should lead to playable string-fret combinations throughout the entire track and, in general, preserve parsimonious motion between successive combinations. Throughout the history of guitar playing, specific chord fingerings have been developed across different musical styles that facilitate common idiomatic voicing combinations and motion between them. This paper presents a method for assigning guitar tablature notation to a given MIDI-based musical part (possibly consisting of multiple polyphonic tracks), i.e. no information about guitar-idiomatic expressional characteristics is involved (e.g. bending etc.) The current strategy is based on machine learning and requires a basic assumption about how much fingers can stretch on a fretboard; only standard 6-string guitar tuning is examined. The proposed method also examines the transcription of music pieces that was not meant to be played or could not possibly be played by a guitar (e.g. potentially a symphonic orchestra part), employing a rudimentary method for augmenting musical information and training/testing the system with artificial data. The results present interesting aspects about what the system can achieve when trained on the initial and augmented dataset, showing that the training with augmented data improves the performance even in simple, e.g. monophonic, cases. Results also indicate weaknesses and lead to useful conclusions about possible improvements.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10619","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.755890","language":"en","tags":["csai","preprints","research","cssd","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Maximos Kaliakatsos-Papakostas, Gregoris Bastas, Dimos Makris, Dorien Herremans, Vassilis Katsouros, Petros Maragos","raw_content_length":1660,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MIDI","Guitar Tablature Conversion"],"persons":["Guitar"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1659,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Machine Learning Approach","MIDI","Guitar Tablature Conversion","arXiv251010619v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Guitar tablature transcription","the string","the fret number","which","each note"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A Machine Learning Approach"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Machine Learning Approach":2.0,"MIDI":2.0,"Guitar Tablature Conversion":2.0,"arXiv251010619v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Guitar tablature transcription":1.0,"the string":1.0,"the fret number":1.0,"which":1.0,"each note":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7526115591666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9293,"joy":0.0263,"surprise":0.0222,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.0083,"disgust":0.0066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a machine learning method for converting MIDI to guitar tablature.

However, existing context parallel methods rely on static parallelization configurations that overlook the dynamic nature of training data, specifically, the variability in sequence lengths and token relationships (i.e., attention patterns) across samples. As a result, these methods often suffer from unnecessary communication overhead and imbalanced computation. In this paper, we present DCP, a dynamic context parallel training framework that introduces fine-grained blockwise partitioning of both data and computation. By enabling flexible mapping of data and computation blocks to devices, DCP can adapt to varying sequence characteristics, effectively reducing communication and improving memory and computation balance. Micro-benchmarks demonstrate that DCP accelerates attention by 1.19x~2.45x under causal masks and 2.15x~3.77x under sparse attention patterns. Additionally, we observe up to 0.94x~1.16x end-to-end training speed-up for causal masks, and 1.00x~1.46x for sparse masks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10620","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.756273","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","csdc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Chenyu Jiang, Zhenkun Cai, Ye Tian, Zhen Jia, Yida Wang, Chuan Wu","raw_content_length":1186,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DCP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1185,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Input Dynamism","Long","arXiv251010620v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Context parallelism","a key technique","long-context training","generative AI","modern large models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["long-context training"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Input Dynamism":2.0,"Long":2.0,"arXiv251010620v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Context parallelism":1.0,"a key technique":1.0,"long-context training":1.0,"generative AI":1.0,"modern large models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752626571388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.1125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8225,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.881,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0719,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0075,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0082},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel dynamic context parallel training framework (DCP) that improves the efficiency of training large AI models.

They rely heavily on matrix multiplication and require efficient acceleration due to their substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization plays a vital role in reducing memory usage, and can be exploited for computations by designing reconfigurable architectures that enhance matrix multiplication by dynamically adjusting the precision. This paper proposes ADiP, a novel adaptive-precision systolic array architecture designed for efficient matrix multiplication acceleration.The proposed architecture consists of NxN adaptive-precision processing elements (PEs) and shared accumulators. ADiP supports multiple computation modes, including symmetric single-matrix multiplication as well as asymmetric multi-matrix multiplication with a shared input matrix, thereby improving data-reuse and PE utilization. In addition, ADiP maximizes the computational density by adapting to different precisions, such as 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit. Analytical models are developed for ADiP architecture, including latency and throughput for versatile architecture configurations. A comprehensive hardware design space exploration is demonstrated using 22nm commercial technology, achieving up to a 4x higher computational throughput. Furthermore, ADiP is evaluated on different transformer workloads from GPT-2 Medium, BERT Large, and BitNet-1.58B models, delivering latency improvement up to 53.6%, and energy improvement up to 24.4% for BitNet-1.58B MHA workloads. At a 64x64 size with 4096 PEs, ADiP achieves a peak throughput of 8.192 TOPS, 16.384 TOPS, and 32.768 TOPS for 8bitx8bit, 8bitx4bit, and 8bitx2bit operations, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10623","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.757073","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csar","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Ahmed J.

The problems of interest focus on geometric parameters that describe the crack configuration and may pose challenges to constructing efficient ROMs. This work proposes a framework based on non-intrusive reduced basis methods and a localization strategy tailored to parametric problems with moving discontinuities. The combined benefits of non-intrusive ROMs and localization enable accurate and efficient reduction with low online cost.

Black-box methods presume access only to the model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples. This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10625","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.757880","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscv","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Yuval Golbari, Navve Wasserman, Gal Vardi, Michal Irani","raw_content_length":1638,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Realistic Scenarios arXiv:2510.10625v1","Membership Inference Attack"],"persons":[],"locations":["ImpMIA"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1637,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Membership Inference Attack","ImpMIA","Implicit Bias","Realistic Scenarios","arXiv251010625v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","which","data samples","a well-studied and important problem","implications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Membership Inference Attack":3.0,"ImpMIA":2.0,"Implicit Bias":2.0,"Realistic Scenarios":2.0,"arXiv251010625v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"which":1.0,"data samples":1.0,"a well-studied and important problem":1.0,"implications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752686591111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8155,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6369,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6927,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0206,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.1638,"anger":0.076,"disgust":0.0297},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (ImpMIA) for membership inference attacks, focusing on data privacy.

However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10631","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.758671","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Zhaolin Hu, Kun Li, Hehe Fan, Yi Yang","raw_content_length":1318,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Graph Transformers","Linear","Linear Graph Transformer"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1317,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["GraphTARIF","Linear Graph Transformer","Augmented Rank and Improved Focus","arXiv251010631v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Linear attention mechanisms","efficient alternatives","full self-attention","Graph Transformers","linear time complexity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Graph Transformers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"GraphTARIF":2.0,"Linear Graph Transformer":2.0,"Augmented Rank and Improved Focus":2.0,"arXiv251010631v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Linear attention mechanisms":1.0,"efficient alternatives":1.0,"full self-attention":1.0,"Graph Transformers":1.0,"linear time complexity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752716422222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8541,"joy":0.0092,"surprise":0.0133,"sadness":0.0141,"fear":0.0346,"anger":0.0344,"disgust":0.0404},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel graph transformer architecture (GraphTARIF) that improves the efficiency of graph neural networks.

We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture, portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score (0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding.

Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold, rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives, all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective, substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly outperforms prior latent-based methods.

To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens.

Existing methods typically fall into two categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods, which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free, removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization layer.

In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists.

However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse. To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10649","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.762205","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Can Xie, Ruotong Pan, Xiangyu Wu, Yunfei Zhang, Jiayi Fu, Tingting Gao, Guorui Zhou","raw_content_length":1435,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UCAS","UnCertainty","Reinforcement Learning","GRPO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1434,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["RLVR","Unlocking Exploration","Uncertainty","arXiv251010649v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Reinforcement Learning","Verifiable Rewards","significant promise","the reasoning capabilities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Uncertainty","Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"RLVR":3.0,"Unlocking Exploration":2.0,"Uncertainty":2.0,"arXiv251010649v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Reinforcement Learning":1.0,"Verifiable Rewards":1.0,"significant promise":1.0,"the reasoning capabilities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752848871111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.18,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.836,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6704,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.015,"sadness":0.0214,"fear":0.2136,"anger":0.04,"disgust":0.0346},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new algorithm (UCAS) to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, specifically in mathematical reasoning.

Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is a method for coordinating DERs, such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) and electric vehicles, within customer quality-of-service (QoS) limits. In PEM, a DER uses local information to offer flexibility by sending a request to the DER coordinator to turn-ON or turn-OFF. Much work has focused on modeling and analyzing aggregations of DERs under PEM with fixed packet durations and only turn-ON requests. Different recent efforts to enable variable packet lengths have shown an increase in available flexibility and ramping capability, but have not been modeled in aggregate, which limits systematic analyses. To address this issue, this paper presents a new aggregate bin-based (macro) model of PEM loads that incorporates both turn-ON and turn-OFF request features, enabling the model to accurately characterize the capability of the fleet of DERs to track a power reference signal, population temperature dynamics, aggregate request rates, and variable packet lengths. Simulation-based validation is performed against an agent-based (micro) model to evaluate robustness and quantify model accuracy. Finally, the distribution of variable packet lengths from macro-model simulations are applied to inform past work on PEM with randomized packet lengths","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10651","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.763004","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Mohammad Hassan, Mads R.

In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset.

The new scheme is an extension of the one-stage compact and efficient high-order GKS (CEHGKS, Li et al. , 2021. J. Comput. Phys. 447, 110661) in the finite volume framework. The main ideas of the new scheme consist of two parts. Firstly, starting from a fully discrete DG formulation, the numerical fluxes and volume integrals are expanded in time. Secondly, the time derivatives are replaced by spatial derivatives using the techniques in CEHGKS. To suppress the non-physical oscillations in the discontinuous regions while minimizing the number of \"troubled cells\", an effective limiter strategy compatible with the new scheme has been developed by combining the KXRCF indicator and the SHWENO reconstruction technique. The new scheme can achieve arbitrary high-order accuracy in both space and time, thereby breaking the previous limitation of no more than third-order accuracy in existing one-stage DG-HGKS schemes. Numerical tests in 1D and 2D have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the scheme.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10656","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.763817","language":"en","tags":["physicscomp-ph","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Mengqing Zhang, Shiyi Li, Dongmi Luo, Jianxian Qiu, Yibing Chen","raw_content_length":1217,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Euler"],"persons":["Galerkin","Li et al.","J.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ac8c1d0588bc","title":"Stability Under Scrutiny: Benchmarking Representation Paradigms for Online HD Mapping","content":"arXiv:2510.10660v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both.

We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f2857cbad7d7","title":"Information","content":"arXiv:2510.11545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks. While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces. Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance, when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a 13.5% degradation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11545","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.995199","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Jiayu Ding, Lei Cui, Li Dong, Nanning Zheng, Furu Wei","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Information","arXiv251011545v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","Large Language Models","LLMs","the length","reasoning chains","performance","complex tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Information":2.0,"arXiv251011545v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"the length":1.0,"reasoning chains":1.0,"performance":1.0,"complex tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.759815754722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.9515,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5903,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4911,"joy":0.0155,"surprise":0.0142,"sadness":0.0123,"fear":0.4213,"anger":0.0345,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method to protect LLMs from unauthorized distillation by reformulating reasoning traces.

This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing. In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities. Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally, we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\\% improvement over Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle.

To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input.

The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering).

Reverse reconciliation (RR) is generally preferred, since the eavesdropper has less information about Bob's measurements than about Alice's transmitted symbols. When discrete modulation formats are employed, however, soft information is available only at Bob's side, while Alice has access only to hard information (her transmitted sequence). This forces her to rely on hard-decision decoding to recover Bob's key. In this work, we introduce a novel RR technique for PAM (and QAM) in which Bob discloses a carefully designed soft metric to help Alice recover Bob's key, while leaking no additional information about the key to an eavesdropper. We assess the performance of the proposed technique in terms of achievable secret key rate (SKR) and its bounds, showing that the achievable SKR closely approaches the upper bound, with a significant gain over hard-decision RR. Finally, we implement the scheme at the coded level using binary LDPC codes with belief-propagation decoding, assess its bit-error rate through numerical simulations, compare the observed gain with theoretical predictions from the achievable SKR, and discuss the residual gap.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10674","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.768038","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","mathit","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Marco Origlia, Marco Secondini","raw_content_length":1389,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Alice","PAM","Soft-Decoding Reverse Reconciliation in Discrete arXiv:2510.10674v1 Announce Type","QAM"],"persons":["Alice","Bob"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1386,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Soft-Decoding Reverse Reconciliation","Discrete","arXiv251010674v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","continuous-variable quantum key distribution","information reconciliation","a shared secret key","correlated random variables","the quantum channel","Reverse reconciliation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Soft-Decoding Reverse Reconciliation":2.0,"Discrete":2.0,"arXiv251010674v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"continuous-variable quantum key distribution":1.0,"information reconciliation":1.0,"a shared secret key":1.0,"correlated random variables":1.0,"the quantum channel":1.0,"Reverse reconciliation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7530639327777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.908,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.0319,"sadness":0.0088,"fear":0.0056,"anger":0.0139,"disgust":0.0225},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel technique for reverse reconciliation in quantum key distribution, aiming to improve secret key rate.

While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation.

In this paper, we introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on 22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to prompting-based methods.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fd78bf5f670b","title":"Action","content":"arXiv:2510.10682v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover, in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential future cues can be generated to represent intention.

However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10689","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.771288","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Caorui Li, Yu Chen, Yiyan Ji, Jin Xu, Zhenyu Cui, Shihao Li, Yuanxing Zhang, Jiafu Tang, Zhenghao Song, Dingling Zhang, Ying He, Haoxiang Liu, Yuxuan Wang, Qiufeng Wang, Zhenhe Wu, Jiehui Luo, Zhiyu Pan, Weihao Xie, Chenchen Zhang, Zhaohui Wang, Jiayi Tian, Yanghai Wang, Zhe Cao, Minxin Dai, Ke Wang, Runzhe Wen, Yinghao Ma, Yaning Pan, Sungkyun Chang, Termeh Taheri, Haiwen Xia, Christos Plachouras, Emmanouil Benetos, Yizhi Li, Ge Zhang, Jian Yang, Tianhao Peng, Zili Wang, Minghao Liu, Junran Peng, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Jiaheng Liu","raw_content_length":1579,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1578,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["OmniVideoBench","Towards Audio","new Abstract","Recent advances","multimodal large language models","MLLMs","substantial potential","video understanding","existing benchmarks","synergistic reasoning capabilities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["multimodal large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"OmniVideoBench":3.0,"Towards Audio":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"multimodal large language models":1.0,"MLLMs":1.0,"substantial potential":1.0,"video understanding":1.0,"existing benchmarks":1.0,"synergistic reasoning capabilities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7531837925000002,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.7015000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6597,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8546,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0343,"sadness":0.0252,"fear":0.013,"anger":0.0411,"disgust":0.0284},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in video understanding.

Due to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction. In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos.

Despite advances in uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10694","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.772123","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Ying-Kuan Tsai, Vispi Karkaria, Yi-Ping Chen, Wei Chen","raw_content_length":1868,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Deep Reinforcement Learning","Multi arXiv:2510.10694v1 Announce Type","CCD","DRL","Control Co-Design"],"persons":["Digital Twin"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1867,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Digital Twin-enabled Multi","arXiv251010694v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Control Co","-Design CCD","physical and control system design","the performance","dynamic and autonomous systems","advances"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Digital Twin-enabled Multi":2.0,"arXiv251010694v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Control Co":1.0,"-Design CCD":1.0,"physical and control system design":1.0,"the performance":1.0,"dynamic and autonomous systems":1.0,"advances":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7532130719444448,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6925,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5385,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7727,"joy":0.0141,"surprise":0.0431,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.1342,"anger":0.021,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a digital twin-enabled control co-design framework using deep reinforcement learning for active suspension systems.

Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018, proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10701","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.773310","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cslo","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Yang Xu, Shuwei Chen, Jun Liu, Feng Cao, Xingxing He","raw_content_length":1835,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Extended Triangular Method","the Extended Triangular Met","CSE","Artificial Intelligence (AI","The Contradiction Separation Extension"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1834,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Extended Triangular Method","A Generalized Algorithm","Contradiction Separation","Automated Deduction","Announce Type","new Abstract","Automated deduction","the core","Artificial Intelligence","theorem proving"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A Generalized Algorithm","Artificial Intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Extended Triangular Method":2.0,"A Generalized Algorithm":2.0,"Contradiction Separation":2.0,"Automated Deduction":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Automated deduction":1.0,"the core":1.0,"Artificial Intelligence":1.0,"theorem proving":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7532570594444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.862,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4276,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9005,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0489,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0108,"anger":0.0187,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a new algorithm (ETM) for automated deduction, which could potentially improve the efficiency of AI systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c1fe3b591b98","title":"Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning","content":"arXiv:2510.10703v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning. While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL) problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the first-order logic translation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.774143","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Xiangyu Wang, Haocheng Yang, Fengxiang Cheng, Fenrong Liu","raw_content_length":1744,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning arXiv:2510.10703v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1743,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive Selection","Symbolic Languages","LLM Logical Reasoning","arXiv251010703v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","LLMs","complex logical reasoning","previous works","remarkable improvements"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Logical Reasoning","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive Selection":2.0,"Symbolic Languages":2.0,"LLM Logical Reasoning":2.0,"arXiv251010703v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"complex logical reasoning":1.0,"previous works":1.0,"remarkable improvements":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753286971111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.200999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8402,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6513,"joy":0.0125,"surprise":0.2901,"sadness":0.0092,"fear":0.0114,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a method to improve LLM logical reasoning by adaptively selecting symbolic languages.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_97ef7f8f81b0","title":"Learning","content":"arXiv:2412.03611v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Estimating the frequency of items on the high-volume, fast data stream has been extensively studied in many areas, such as database and network measurement. Traditional sketches provide only coarse estimates under strict memory constraints. Although some learning-augmented methods have emerged recently, they typically rely on offline training with real frequencies or/and labels, which are often unavailable. Moreover, these methods suffer from slow update speeds, limiting their suitability for real-time processing despite offering only marginal accuracy improvements. To overcome these challenges, we propose UCL-sketch, a practical learning-based paradigm for per-key frequency estimation. Our design introduces two key innovations: (i) an online training mechanism based on equivalent learning that requires no ground truth (GT), and (ii) a highly scalable architecture leveraging logically structured estimation buckets to scale to real-world data stream. The UCL-sketch, which utilizes compressive sensing (CS), converges to an estimator that provably yields a error bound far lower than that of prior works, without sacrificing the speed of processing. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previously proposed approaches regarding per-key accuracy and distribution. Notably, under extremely tight memory budgets, its quality almost matches that of an (infeasible) omniscient oracle. Moreover, compared to the existing equation-based sketch, UCL-sketch achieves an average decoding speedup of nearly 500 times.

Recently, generative networks have been increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an alphabet \\Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \\Sigma with tree edit distance at most d from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 ) and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture, the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35% and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and valid tree-structured data generation.

It is recognized by application and smartphone makers, who provide tools to track the amount of use, set limits, or block certain services at predefined times. These tools, while powerful, may require significant cognitive effort to operate: configuration parameters need to be set, and captured statistics need to be analyzed. To offer a complementary solution, we propose a radically different approach. We employ the keyboard of a smartphone as an output device. With each press of a key, the user is given a high-level, qualitative, color-encoded estimate of the amount of recent smartphone use. The technique, dubbed the informative keyboard, is a case of implicit interaction: the user's intention is to enter text but, while typing, they receive the feedback. In the paper, we elaborate the concept, identify design decisions, describe our implementation, present the outcome of a questionnaire-based evaluation, and point to some other applications of the informative keyboard.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10710","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.775341","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cshc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Jaroslaw Domaszewicz, Damian Sienicki, Michal Obirek","raw_content_length":1117,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Application to Raise Awareness"],"persons":["Informative Keyboard"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1116,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Informative Keyboard","its Application","Awareness","Smartphone Use","new Abstract","Excessive smartphone use","a personal and societal problem","application","smartphone makers","who"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Informative Keyboard":2.0,"its Application":2.0,"Awareness":2.0,"Smartphone Use":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Excessive smartphone use":1.0,"a personal and societal problem":1.0,"application":1.0,"smartphone makers":1.0,"who":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753333296666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8179,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0126,"fear":0.0235,"anger":0.0838,"disgust":0.0355},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach to reducing smartphone usage by providing feedback through the keyboard.

This task aims to extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead. Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond the constraints of textual descriptions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10715","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.776118","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","csgr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Shelly Golan, Yotam Nitzan, Zongze Wu, Or Patashnik","raw_content_length":1825,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VLM arXiv:2510.10715v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","VLM","VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1824,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["VLM","arXiv251010715v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Creative generation","the synthesis","new surprising and valuable samples","user intent","advance","This task","human imagination"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"VLM":2.0,"arXiv251010715v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Creative generation":1.0,"the synthesis":1.0,"new surprising and valuable samples":1.0,"user intent":1.0,"advance":1.0,"This task":1.0,"human imagination":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7533578469444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.637,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9274,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2523,"joy":0.018,"surprise":0.6352,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.0489,"anger":0.0249,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel method for creative image generation using a vision-language model.

Both methods maintain multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist regret bounds of $\\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \\sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \\texttt{GLM-ES} and $\\mathcal{O}(\\widetilde{d} \\sqrt{T})$ for \\texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is the dimension of feature vectors, $\\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.

Achieving this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors and adapt virtual environments accordingly.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10742","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.780338","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Yuan Xu, Zimu Zhang, Xiaoxuan Ma, Wentao Zhu, Yu Qiao, Yizhou Wang","raw_content_length":1362,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1361,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["My Future","Situated Interaction Behavior","Virtual Reality","arXiv251010742v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Virtual and augmented reality systems","intelligent adaptation","to user behaviors","enhanced interaction experiences","human intentions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"My Future":2.0,"Situated Interaction Behavior":2.0,"Virtual Reality":2.0,"arXiv251010742v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Virtual and augmented reality systems":1.0,"intelligent adaptation":1.0,"to user behaviors":1.0,"enhanced interaction experiences":1.0,"human intentions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753516068888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.36,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.872,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8451,"joy":0.0297,"surprise":0.0507,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0409,"anger":0.0223,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a framework for predicting user behavior in VR environments, which could potentially lead to more efficient resource use in VR applications.

Rightsizing and autoscaling works have innovated on allocation/scaling policies assuming the ubiquity and necessity of CPU-limits . We question this. Practical experiences of cloud users indicate that CPU-limits harms application performance and costs more than it helps. These observations are in contradiction to the conventional wisdom presented in both academic research and industry best practices. We argue that this indiscriminate adoption of CPU-limits is driven by erroneous beliefs that CPU-limits is essential for operational and safety purposes. We provide empirical evidence making a case for eschewing CPU-limits completely from latency-sensitive applications. This prompts a fundamental rethinking of auto-scaling and billing paradigms and opens new research avenues. Finally, we highlight specific scenarios where CPU-limits can be beneficial if used in a well-reasoned way (e.g. background jobs).","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10747","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.780740","language":"en","tags":["csos","cspf","preprints","csdc","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Chirag Shetty, Sarthak Chakraborty, Hubertus Franke, Larisa Shwartz, Chandra Narayanaswami, Indranil Gupta, Saurabh Jha","raw_content_length":1198,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CPU"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1197,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CPU","arXiv251010747v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Research","compute resource management","cloud-native applications","the problem","optimal CPU limits","a fundamental OS mechanism","a containers CPU usage"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["Research"],"research_academic":["Research"],"ai_ml":["a containers CPU usage"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CPU":2.0,"arXiv251010747v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Research":1.0,"compute resource management":1.0,"cloud-native applications":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"optimal CPU limits":1.0,"a fundamental OS mechanism":1.0,"a containers CPU usage":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753530449166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.5460000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6908,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8629,"joy":0.0043,"surprise":0.0289,"sadness":0.0109,"fear":0.0212,"anger":0.0306,"disgust":0.0412},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research questions the necessity of CPU limits, arguing they harm performance and increase costs for latency-sensitive applications.

The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets, seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres, while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution. Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural decomposition.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10751","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.781518","language":"en","tags":["research","csgr","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Ningna Wang, Rui Xu, Yibo Yin, Zichun Zhong, Taku Komura, Wenping Wang, Xiaohu Guo","raw_content_length":1263,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MATFP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1262,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MATStruct","arXiv251010751v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a novel optimization framework","the medial axis transform","the medial structure","high medial mesh quality","The medial structure","interconnected sheets","seams"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MATStruct":2.0,"arXiv251010751v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a novel optimization framework":1.0,"the medial axis transform":1.0,"the medial structure":1.0,"high medial mesh quality":1.0,"The medial structure":1.0,"interconnected sheets":1.0,"seams":1.0}},"age_hours":2.753559972222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8648,"joy":0.0455,"surprise":0.0674,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.0084,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis transform.
