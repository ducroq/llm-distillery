{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_76c34cdf7c1e","title":"Trump militariseert de Amerikaanse samenleving, maar waar gaat het toe leiden?","content":"De regering-Trump lijkt bezig de Amerikaanse samenleving te militariseren en politieke tegenstanders dwars te zitten. Trump gaf zichzelf een militaire parade cadeau toen hij 79 werd. In Democratische steden zet hij de Nationale Garde in, ook al is die daar niet welkom. Trump wil verder het ministerie van Defensie omdopen tot het ministerie van Oorlog, en onlangs zinspeelde de president tijdens een uitzonderlijke bijeenkomst met honderden Amerikaanse topmilitairen op de inzet van het leger tegen 'binnenlandse vijanden', met name in de steden. \"Dit toenemende militaire machtsvertoon past bij een regering die zich met de dag autocratischer opstelt\", zegt jurist en Amerikadeskundige Kenneth Manusama. \"Hij wil daarmee laten zien dat hij een daadkrachtige en sterke leider is.\" Oorlogsgebieden Na Los Angeles en Washington, afgelopen zomer, zijn er nu ook troepen van de Nationale Garde gestationeerd in een militair trainingscentrum in de buurt van Chicago. Ze mogen nog niet de straat op omdat een rechter dat voorlopig heeft geblokkeerd. Ook in de stad Portland mogen ze nog niet worden ingezet. Trump heeft het over 'oorlogsgebieden' waar gevochten moet worden tegen criminele bendes en hard moet worden opgetreden bij protesten tegen zijn anti-immigratiebeleid. \"Maar de echte reden is dat hij controle wil over de oppositie\", zegt Manusuma. Staten zijn zelf verantwoordelijk voor ordehandhaving en hebben meestal geen behoefte aan ondersteuning. \"Door federale troepen in te zetten zet hij lokale democratische bestuurders klem. Hij wil laten zien wie de baas is.\" Amerikaanse grondwet In de VS zweren militairen trouw aan de grondwet en beloven ze het Amerikaanse volk te dienen - niet een leider of een partij. Het beleid van Trump, die ook trouw heeft gezworen aan de grondwet, staat daarmee op gespannen voet. Volgens Manusama gaat de militarisering verder dan de inzet van de Nationale Garde op plekken waar dat niet nodig is: \"Het gaat om symboliek, om wat het leger uit moet stralen\", zegt hij. Zo zijn er al veel vrouwelijke militairen, transgenders en medewerkers van kleur ontslagen. \"Het leger moet traditionele mannelijkheid ademen en loyaal zijn aan de opperbevelhebber, de president\", zegt Manusama. Politisering krijgsmacht Dit is hoe de politisering van de Amerikaanse krijgsmacht eruit ziet\", zegt een andere Amerikadeskundige, Casper Thomas. \"Het Witte Huis zet het leger steeds vaker en zichtbaarder in om politieke doelen te bereiken.\" Trump zegt dat hij vecht tegen 'de vijand van binnenuit'. Wat hij daarmee bedoelt, laat hij bewust in het midden, zegt Thomas. \"Op deze manier kan het begrip breed worden ingezet.\" Volgens Manusama gaat het om allerlei soorten politieke tegenstanders, zoals wetenschappers, atheïsten, democraten, journalisten en mensen van kleur. \"Uiteindelijk willen ze een soort wit christelijk nationalisme verspreiden\", denkt hij. \"Met het christelijk geloof als bron van normen en waarden, het gezin als hoeksteen van de samenleving en een traditionele rolverdeling tussen man en vrouw.\" \"Ik ben nog nooit een kamer ingelopen waar het zó stil is\", zei Trump op de bijeenkomst met de topmilitairen. \"Die stilte was veelzeggend, een vorm van verzet\", zegt Manusama. \"Want als ze zouden doen wat Trump het liefste wil, dan zouden ze hard voor hem applaudisseren. Iets dat helemaal niet bij het Amerikaanse leger past.\" Geregeld wordt een besluit van de regering-Trump in de rechtbank aangevochten en hier en daar zijn er demonstraties. \"Maar grootschalige protesten blijven tot nu toe uit\", zegt Manusama. Veel Amerikanen vinden het volgens hem prettig om een sterke, zichtbare leider te hebben. \"Daarbij denk ik dat het gewone burgers nog te weinig raakt in hun dagelijks leven. Ze halen hun schouders op en vinden het overdreven als gezegd wordt dat hun land afglijdt naar een dictatuur.\" De Democratische partij levert nog weinig weerwerk, al zijn er Democratische bestuurders die het openlijk opnemen tegen Trump, zoals de gouverneur van Californië, Gavin Newsom. \"Ze zoeken een manier om met de huidige machthebbers om te gaan\", zegt Thomas. \"Ze kunnen ook nauwelijks tegenwicht bieden omdat de Republikeinen ook het Congres in handen hebben.\" Politieke agenda Trumps tweede termijn is eigenlijk pas net begonnen, maar de snelheid waarmee hij veranderingen doorvoert roept de vraag op waar het militaire machtsvertoon toe kan leiden. Amerikadeskundige Thomas: \"Misschien doorlopen ze een uitgewerkt stappenplan, maar er wordt ook geïmproviseerd.\" Volgens Manusama laten de afgelopen maanden zien dat Trump de strijdkrachten naar zijn hand probeert te zetten. Mogelijk probeert hij ook om het juridisch makkelijker te maken om militairen in het binnenland te gebruiken \"om zijn eigen politieke agenda door te drukken\", zegt Manusama.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586474","published_date":"2025-10-14T18:19:40","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.101352","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":733,"author":null,"raw_content_length":6408,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.665,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nationale Garde","ministerie van Defensie omdopen","regering-Trump"],"persons":["Trump","Kenneth Manusama"],"locations":["Washington","Oorlogsgebieden"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4789,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["de Amerikaanse samenleving","het","hij","het ministerie","De regering-Trump","politieke tegenstanders","een militaire parade","cadeau","Democratische steden","Garde"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["een militaire parade"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"de Amerikaanse samenleving":3.0,"het":2.0,"hij":2.0,"het ministerie":2.0,"De regering-Trump":1.0,"politieke tegenstanders":1.0,"een militaire parade":1.0,"cadeau":1.0,"Democratische steden":1.0,"Garde":1.0}},"age_hours":0.3967412616666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5008,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0698,"sadness":0.028,"fear":0.2324,"anger":0.087,"disgust":0.0732},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes the militarization of American society under the Trump administration.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_59a90f1577ff","title":"Dit Nederlandse bedrijf maakt drones waarmee Oekraïne doelen diep in Rusland raakt","content":"Bijna dagelijks neemt Oekraïne Russische olie-installaties onder vuur. Met langeafstandsdrones doet het Oekraïense leger vernietigende aanvallen tot diep in Siberië. President Zelensky mag daar graag over opscheppen. Minder bekend is dat een aantal van deze drones worden gemaakt door een Nederlands bedrijf: Destinus. De NOS mocht kijken bij een van de vestigingen van deze jonge defensieonderneming, in Hengelo. \"In 2023 hebben we onze eerste drones geproduceerd en die zijn ook ingezet in Oekraïne. Dat ging toen over tientallen, inmiddels gaat het over duizenden.\" En het moeten er nog meer worden. Commercieel directeur Wouter van Beek wil liever geen cijfer noemen, maar het bedrijf mikt op een veelvoud. Ruta De drones zelf mogen we niet filmen, maar wel de motoren die worden gemaakt en getest. Het algemene beeld van een drone is een zoemend apparaat met propellers aan vier uitstekende armen. Maar die maken ze hier niet: \"We produceren grote drones met vaste vleugels. Sommige worden ook aangedreven door turbojet engines. Dan moet je denken aan een motor vergelijkbaar met die van een vliegtuig. En deze kan een drone met een behoorlijk zwaar gewicht over grote afstanden vervoeren.\" Dat gewicht is de springlading, of in jargon, de 'warhead'. De Ruta, zoals de drone heet, heeft een bereik van een paar honderd kilometer en kan een lading vervoeren van ettelijke tientallen kilo's. Exacte cijfers zijn niet te noemen. Het doelwit is leidend: hoe verder weg, hoe lichter de lading, want meer brandstof betekent minder springlading. Tomahawk Deze drone is eigenlijk een kleine kruisraket, maar dan voor een tiende van de prijs van de befaamde Amerikaanse Tomahawk-raket die twee miljoen dollar kost. Het voordeel van zo'n relatief goedkope drone is dat er snel veel van gemaakt kunnen worden: \"Een golf van drones verhoogt de kans op succes,\" zegt de commercieel directeur over de tactiek van het sturen van grote aantallen drones om het Russische luchtafweer te overspoelen. De 'opschaalbaarheid' van de productie moet ook interessant zijn voor landen die niet in oorlog zijn, zoals Nederland. Het ministerie van Defensie hoeft dan geen grote voorraden aan te houden. Maar er kan snel meer geproduceerd worden als dat nodig is, in het geval van een conflict. Elektronische oorlogvoering De kleine kruisraket en ook de andere langeafstandsdrones die Destinus produceert, maken gebruik van kunstmatige intelligentie om doelen te kunnen raken. Grote afstanden vliegen over Rusland betekent weerbaar moeten zijn tegen verstoring door elektronische oorlogsvoering. Van Beek: \"Met behulp van een camera aan de onderzijde herkent hij het landschap. En door middel van AI-technologie bepaalt hij zijn positie. Je kunt dan navigeren, terwijl er geen GPS-signaal beschikbaar is.\" De AI komt van een Zwitsers bedrijf dat onlangs is overgenomen. Behalve in Hengelo heeft Destinus inmiddels vestigingen in een groot aantal Europese landen, zoals Spanje, Duitsland, het Verenigd Koninkrijk en niet in de laatste plaats Oekraïne. Wat dat betreft kan het jonge bedrijf dan ook geen start-up meer genoemd worden. Het telt inmiddels ruim 600 werknemers. Oekraïne is heel belangrijk voor dit defensiebedrijf, want daar wordt de proef op de som genomen. Staand voor een werkbank met kabels vertelt Van Beek: \"Pas als je een systeem test onder de druk van een echte oorlogssituatie zie je of systemen een papieren exercitie zijn, of dat ze ook echt werken.\" De directeur kan weinig zeggen over het Oekraïense gebruik van de drones: \"Dit zijn inderdaad de drones die lange-afstandsmissies uitvoeren, maar ik kan geen details geven over type missies.\" Vuurballen De Oekraïners lijken er wel vaak in te slagen om beelden te verkrijgen van de aanvallen op de Russische olie-installaties. Die delen ze maar wat graag. Op sociale media barst het van de vuurballen en gigantische branden, als er weer een doel is getroffen. Zelensky noemt de aanvallen de meeste effectieve en directe sanctie tegen de olie-industrie, de belangrijkste inkomstenbron van de Rusland.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586473","published_date":"2025-10-14T18:07:53","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.102703","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":633,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4320,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.165,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NOS"],"persons":["Destinus","Wouter van Beek","President Zelensky"],"locations":["Rusland","Oekraïne","Siberië","Hengelo"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4047,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dit Nederlandse bedrijf","drones","Russische olie-installaties","vuur","langeafstandsdrones","het Oekraïense leger","vernietigende aanvallen","President","een aantal","deze drones"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dit Nederlandse bedrijf":2.0,"drones":2.0,"Russische olie-installaties":1.0,"vuur":1.0,"langeafstandsdrones":1.0,"het Oekraïense leger":1.0,"vernietigende aanvallen":1.0,"President":1.0,"een aantal":1.0,"deze drones":1.0}},"age_hours":0.5931467566666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.682,"joy":0.019,"surprise":0.1008,"sadness":0.0345,"fear":0.069,"anger":0.0523,"disgust":0.0425},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a Dutch company producing drones used in Ukraine, with thousands already deployed.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_fe82e217730c","title":"Amerikaanse invloed en 'roekeloze' topman: chipfabrikant Nexperia onder vergrootglas","content":"Het is een bedrijf dat voor velen tot deze week onbekend was, maar nu in het middelpunt van de belangstelling staat. Chipfabrikant Nexperia blijkt een speelbal te zijn van belangen die zich uitstrekken tot Amerika en China. Uit rechtbankstukken en een Kamerbrief van minister Karremans, wordt duidelijk hoe dit heeft geleid tot handelsbeperkingen en een uitzonderlijke ingreep van de Nederlandse overheid. Al jarenlang maakt het bedrijf 'eenvoudige' chips, bedoeld voor bijvoorbeeld telefoons, zonnepanelen en auto's. In 2019 kwam Nexperia in Chinese handen toen het werd overgenomen door het Chinese Wingtech. Een jaar later werd Zhang Xuezheng CEO. Het hoofdkantoor bleef wel in Nijmegen. Zorgen over Chinees bestuur Sinds de Chinese overname groeiden de zorgen. Bestuurders van Nexperia namen eind 2023 contact op met het ministerie van Economische Zaken. Ze maakten zich er zorgen over dat Nexperia in handen was van een Chinese eigenaar, en vroegen om volledige erkenning als Nederland/Europees bedrijf. Ze drongen hierop aan, omdat ze negatieve gevolgen ervoeren in Europa en de Verenigde Staten. Daarop volgden maandenlange gesprekken tussen het ministerie en Nexperia. Het bedrijf deed daarbij toezeggingen. Zo werd een raad van commissarissen beloofd die zou gaan toezien op het inperken van de invloed van de Chinese topman. Maar daar kwam weinig van terecht, blijkt uit rechtbankstukken. Roekeloosheid Ondertussen bleef de onrust over de topman groeien. Zo deed hij namens Experia een miljoenenbestelling bij het Chinese bedrijf WSS, een zusterbedrijf dat financieel in de klem zat, en waar hij zelf een belang in had. Die bestelling was volgens de rechtbank niet nodig en te groot. Daarbovenop trok de Chinese topman vorige maand de betalingsbevoegdheden in van belangrijke financieel bestuurders van het bedrijf. In plaats daarvan liet hij de bankzaken regelen door personen zonder financiële ervaring, onder wie iemand die nog niet bij Nexperia werkte. De rechtbank bestempelde dit als een handelwijze die grenst aan roekeloosheid. Medewerkers van Nexperia stapten daarom naar de Ondernemingskamer van het gerechtshof in Amsterdam, die Xuezheng vervolgens wegstuurde. Druk vanuit Amerika Terwijl het ministerie en Nexperia in gesprek waren, werd de druk van buiten opgevoerd. Wingtech kwam namelijk eind 2024 op een Amerikaanse 'zwarte lijst' terecht, en vanwege de bijbehorende handelsbeperkingen kon Nexperia daar vanaf september ook last van krijgen. Om met bedrijven of personen uit de lijst zaken te doen moet er een speciale vergunning aangevraagd worden, maar die wordt bijna nooit verleend. Om een vrijstelling te krijgen voor deze handelsbeperking zou het nodig zijn om de Chinese topman te vervangen, die zelf ook op de lijst stond. Uit rechtbankstukken blijkt nu dat Xuezheng, door aan te blijven als bestuurder, handelde tegen het belang van Nexperia in. Nederland grijpt in \"Het lijkt er toch wel op dat de VS het signaal heeft afgegeven dat zij een regel invoeren waardoor Nexperia - als onderdeel van Wingtech - onder handelsbeperkingen valt. En dat de Nederlandse overheid toen heeft besloten om bij Nexperia de controle over te nemen\", zegt Sebastiaan Bennink, advocaat internationaal handelsrecht. Minister Karremans benadrukt in zijn brief aan de Tweede Kamer juist dat zijn besluit is genomen \"zonder last of ruggespraak met welk land dan ook\". Maar volgens de rechtbankstukken had het ministerie wel degelijk contact met de VS over de handelsbeperkingen voor Nexperia, en de eis om de topman te vervangen. Volgens Karremans is sprake van een 'noodsituatie' en hij zegt verontrustende signalen te hebben ontvangen over het handelen van de Chinese topman. Bennink denkt dat nu de aandelen niet meer worden beheerd door de Chinese CEO, de VS alsnog een exportvergunning zal afgeven. \"Omdat ze zeker weten dat er geen Chinese invloed meer is binnen het bedrijf.\" Tegenmaatregel De Chinese regering reageerde met een exportverbod op chips uit de Chinese fabriek van Nexperia. Nexperia en Karremans schrijven beide dat er gesprekken plaatsvinden met Chinese autoriteiten. Nexperia zet in op een zo snel mogelijke vrijstelling van de beperkingen om de impact ervan zo klein mogelijk te houden.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586472","published_date":"2025-10-14T17:44:34","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.104110","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":646,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4784,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Chinese Wingtech"],"persons":["Xuezheng CEO","Zhang","Karremans","Chipfabrikant Nexperia"],"locations":["Nijmegen","Amerika","China","Nexperia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4221,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Amerikaanse invloed","roekeloze topman","chipfabrikant Nexperia onder","Het","dat","deze week","het middelpunt","de belangstelling","een speelbal","belangen"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Amerikaanse invloed":2.0,"roekeloze topman":2.0,"chipfabrikant Nexperia onder":2.0,"Het":1.0,"dat":1.0,"deze week":1.0,"het middelpunt":1.0,"de belangstelling":1.0,"een speelbal":1.0,"belangen":1.0}},"age_hours":0.9817734436111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7609,"joy":0.0161,"surprise":0.1066,"sadness":0.0248,"fear":0.0397,"anger":0.0316,"disgust":0.0202},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a policy action by the Dutch government to intervene in a chip manufacturer due to concerns about Chinese influence and potential trade restrictions.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_05c4f20ba2ef","title":"R&B","content":"De Amerikaanse R&B-zanger D'Angelo is op 51-jarige leeftijd overleden. De zanger, wiens echte naam Michael Eugene Archer is, stierf aan de gevolgen van alvleesklierkanker, heeft zijn familie laten weten. De artiest brak in 1995 op 21-jarige leeftijd door met het album Brown Sugar. Hij maakte vijf jaar daarna zijn tweede album, Voodoo. Na het grote succes van dit album trok hij zich terug uit het openbare én muzikale leven. D'Angelo had lange tijd een relatie met zangeres Angie Stone, die dit jaar overleed bij een auto-ongeluk. Hij kampte enkele jaren met drugsproblemen en kwam meermaals in het nieuws vanwege verkeersovertredingen en arrestaties. Ook had hij in 2005 een ernstig auto-ongeluk, dat hij wonder boven wonder overleefde. Black Messiah In 2010 begon hij weer met optreden, en in 2012 trad hij op bij het North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam. In 2014 bracht hij zijn derde album uit, Black Messiah, dat deels was geïnspireerd door politiegeweld en de straatprotesten daartegen die de VS toen in hun greep hadden. Het was tevens zijn laatste album. Met zijn kenmerkende falsetstem, barokke en zoetgevooisde funkproducties en zijn wens om muzikaal alles in eigen hand te houden, werd de multi-instrumentalist D'Angelo gezien als de muzikale opvolger van Prince, iemand die hij zelf ook als groot voorbeeld zag. Alle drie zijn albums worden beschouwd als meesterwerken in de genres neo-soul en R&B, voor de laatste twee won hij ook een Grammy voor beste R&B-album. De bekendste videoclip van D'Angelo, How Does It Feel uit 2000: Na zijn tweede album in 2000 verdween D'Angelo ruim tien jaar lang uit beeld, tot hij comebackshows aankondigde. In 2012 speelde hij in Paradiso. De Nederlandse documentairemaker én fan Carine Bijlsma was van de partij. Zij wist het voor elkaar te krijgen dat ze twee jaar lang met D'Angelo en zijn band mee de wereld over mocht touren. Daar maakte ze de film Devil's Pie over, met beelden van achter de schermen en gesprekken met D'Angelo en zijn bandleden. 'Boven zichzelf uitstijgen' Het is niet zomaar dat Bijlsma zo lang meereisde, vertelde ze aan 3voor12. \"Dat had ook een praktische reden: op tour weet je dat hij er gewoon ís, dat hij je niet dagenlang kan laten wachten\", legde ze in 2019 uit. In dat jaar verscheen de documentaire. \"Maar ik vind het vooral mooi om te laten zien hoe hij terug stapt in een arena waar hij twaalf jaar lang niet te zien was\", zei de documentairemaker. \"Hij had er eerder al ongelooflijke prestaties neergezet, maar dat had ook grote gevolgen. Ik wilde voor de film een moment uitkiezen waar spanning is, waar iemand boven zichzelf uitstijgt.\" Ook na het verschijnen van Devil's Pie belde ze nog wel eens met hem. \"De sfeer op tour is zoals je in de film ziet: een warm familiegevoel, mensen geven heel veel om elkaar. Het gaat om een groep muzikanten met een hele bijzondere diepe relatie.\" De trailer van de documentaire:","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586471","published_date":"2025-10-14T17:12:16","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.105451","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":488,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3562,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.44,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Archer","Festival","North"],"persons":["Michael Eugene","Angie Stone","Sugar","Black Messiah"],"locations":["Rotterdam","Brown"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2906,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["51-jarige leeftijd","De zanger","wiens echte naam","de gevolgen","alvleesklierkanker","zijn familie","De artiest","21-jarige leeftijd","het album","Hij"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"51-jarige leeftijd":1.0,"De zanger":1.0,"wiens echte naam":1.0,"de gevolgen":1.0,"alvleesklierkanker":1.0,"zijn familie":1.0,"De artiest":1.0,"21-jarige leeftijd":1.0,"het album":1.0,"Hij":1.0}},"age_hours":1.5201227116666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7732,"joy":0.0251,"surprise":0.0946,"sadness":0.0344,"fear":0.0242,"anger":0.0208,"disgust":0.0278},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":0,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":0,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is an obituary for a musician.

Dat maakte het SBNL Natuurfonds bekend. De mammoetboom, of reuzensequoia, kreeg 2716 stemmen. Het exemplaar is zo'n 35 meter hoog, heeft een omtrek van bijna 8,5 meter en is naar schatting rond de 160 jaar oud. \"Zijn omvang, zijn standplaats en de hele verschijningsvorm zoals die daar zo majestueus staat\", zegt bomenkenner Maarten Windemuller tegen RTV Oost. \"Het is echt een boom waarvan je denkt als je het park opkomt: wauw, wat is dat daar?\" Over de exacte leeftijd bestaat wat twijfel. Zo staat op een bordje bij de boom dat die rond 1890 is geplant, maar volgens sommigen is hij ouder. Zo zou op een zwart-witfoto uit 1887 te zien zijn dat de boom toen al tientallen jaren oud was. Zaden meegenomen uit Californië De boom werd in de 19e eeuw geplant op initiatief van de familie Ledeboer, die zaden meebracht uit de Amerikaanse staat Californië. De mammoetboom werd dit jaar aangemeld ter ere van 700 jaar stadsrechten voor Enschede. Buurtbewoners voelen zich verbonden met de boom: De reuzensequoia is volgens Windemuller niet de grootste van het land. \"In de buurt staat er eentje van 37 meter hoog, maar die staat in een bos en valt dus niet op. En er zit er nog een in Brummen die geloof ik nog hoger is.\" Dankzij de winst is de Enschedese boom de Nederlandse inzending voor de Europese Tree of the Year 2026. Die verkiezing wordt in februari gehouden.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586463","published_date":"2025-10-14T16:40:47","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.106296","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":254,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1727,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RTV","Enschede","Abraham Ledeboerpark"],"persons":["Ledeboer","Maarten Windemuller"],"locations":["Californië","Oost","Boom"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1462,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Boom","het Jaar","een mammoetboom","meter","De mammoetboom","Jaar","Dat","het SBNL","stemmen","zon 35 meter"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Boom":3.0,"het Jaar":2.0,"een mammoetboom":2.0,"meter":2.0,"De mammoetboom":2.0,"Jaar":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"het SBNL":1.0,"stemmen":1.0,"zon 35 meter":1.0}},"age_hours":2.0448623230555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.717,"joy":0.021,"surprise":0.1491,"sadness":0.0297,"fear":0.031,"anger":0.0271,"disgust":0.025},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the selection of a specific tree as 'Tree of the Year,' highlighting its size (35 meters tall, 8.5 meter circumference) and estimated age (160 years).

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_fd4b940f3a43","title":"'Bigtech' wil niet naar Kamer komen over beïnvloeding verkiezingen","content":"Vertegenwoordigers van Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat en Google willen niet naar de Tweede Kamer komen om daar uitleg te geven over hun activiteiten in verkiezingstijd. Een uitnodiging daarvoor is door de bedrijven afgeslagen of niet beantwoord. De fracties van onder andere GL-PvdA, PVV, NSC, D66, BBB en Volt wilden nog deze week met de bedrijven in gesprek over \"algoritmen en inmenging\" tijdens de verkiezingscampagne. De partijen willen weten in hoeverre de Nederlandse kiezers op een ongeoorloofde manier worden beïnvloed, en wat deze platforms daar aan doen. \"Overal zie je in Europa dat verkiezingen onder druk staan\", zegt GL-PvdA-Kamerlid Kathmann. Zij haalt het voorbeeld aan van de presidentsverkiezingen in Roemenië, waar volgens de Roemeense autoriteiten sprake was van beïnvloeding. \"Wij willen weten wat de techbedrijven kunnen doen zodat het hier niet misgaat.\" Ook BBB wilde het gesprek, met nog een paar weken te gaan tot de verkiezingen op 29 oktober. \"Alle informatie die op mensen afkomt heeft natuurlijk invloed, de traditionele kanalen ook. Maar die algoritmes proberen mensen in een fuik te brengen.\" Verdienen heel veel geld De techbedrijven hebben er kennelijk niet veel belang bij om in de Kamer langs te komen, want ze verdienen heel veel geld met dit soort boodschappen, concludeert Kamerlid Van der Werf (D66). \"Maar wij willen onze democratie schoon houden.\" Volt-Kamerlid Koekkoek vindt het moeilijk te begrijpen dat de bedrijven niet willen komen of zeggen dat ze geen tijd hebben. \"Het zijn grote multinationals waar heel veel mensen werken, en het gaat over onze democratie. Wij vragen dit niet zomaar.\" Uit de uitnodiging aan de techbedrijven blijkt dat de Kamerleden zich zorgen maken na \"mogelijke manipulatie van de Roemeense verkiezingen\" en rapporten van de NCTV en AIVD dat \"radicalisering in alle vormen\" online wordt aangewakkerd, mogelijk door de werking van \"aanbevelingsalgoritmen\". Die algoritmen spelen een grote rol. Die bepalen - mede gebaseerd op de interesse van de kiezer, maar ook op wat op dat moment populair is - wat iemand ziet. Je bepaalt het dus niet helemaal zelf, al lijkt dat soms zo. Kort dag Tiktok, X en Meta reageerden tot nog toe niet, ook niet op verzoeken van de NOS. Google laat de Kamer weten dat de uitnodiging \"pas deze week\" binnenkwam en dat het \"te kort dag\" is om dit in de agenda op te nemen. Het was inderdaad kort dag, erkent initiatiefnemer Kathmann: \"Maar je wordt uitgenodigd voor een gesprek over de veiligheid van onze verkiezingen. Het zijn allemaal bedrijven met meer dan 10.000 medewerkers; ik lees het zo dat je dan te belazerd bent om te komen.\" Ook Vermeer kan niet plaatsen dat de bedrijven geen afgevaardigde willen sturen. \"Een gemiste kans, want ze klagen soms ook dat ze moeite hebben om in contact te komen met Kamerleden. Ik kan niet in hun agenda kijken, maar is er iets belangrijkers dan met Nederlandse volksvertegenwoordigers in gesprek gaan?\" Telefoon opnemen Koekkoek zegt dat het ook geen verrassing kan zijn voor de bedrijven dat de Kamer zich hier zorgen over maakt. \"We zijn hier al jaren mee bezig\", zegt zij. \"Maar het feit dat we dit gesprek hebben geprobeerd, leidt misschien toch ook wel weer tot bewustwording over hoe het werkt.\" Voor jonge kiezers die hun informatie vooral van sociale media halen heeft zij een eenvoudig advies. \"Vraag je altijd af 'waarom zie ik dit en wie zit hierachter? 'En als je denkt 'hé dit is raar': check je feiten.\" Kathmann: \"En ik hoop wel dat ze de telefoon opnemen als premier Schoof belt dat er iets niet in de haak is.\" Regels voor 'bigtech' In Nederland bewaakt, voor zover dat gaat, de Autoriteit Consument en Markt (ACM) de aanbieders van sociale media. In juli heeft de ACM nog twaalf grote online platforms, zoals Facebook, Snaphat, TikTok en X geïnformeerd over de aankomende Tweede Kamerverkiezingen en ze gewezen op hun verantwoordelijkheden. Ze moeten \"een betrouwbaar online publiek debat in verkiezingstijd in Nederland\" garanderen en mogen niet zomaar accounts blokkeren of inhoud verwijderen zonder duidelijke onderbouwing. Illegale haatzaaiende content, \"malafide buitenlandse inmenging\" en desinformatie rond de verkiezingen moeten ze verwijderen. In de EU moet de Digital Services Act consumenten beschermen en de macht van internetgiganten als Google en Meta inperken. Bijvoorbeeld door transparanter te zijn over hun algoritmes en een verbod op gerichte advertenties op basis van religie of politieke opvattingen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586462","published_date":"2025-10-14T16:36:20","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.108585","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":716,"author":null,"raw_content_length":5034,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.58,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tweede Kamer","NSC","PVV"],"persons":["Volt"],"locations":["Roemenië","Google","Europa","D66","Kathmann"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4481,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Kamer","beïnvloeding","de bedrijven","Vertegenwoordigers","uitleg","hun activiteiten","Een uitnodiging daarvoor","beantwoord","De fracties","nog deze week"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Kamer":2.0,"beïnvloeding":2.0,"de bedrijven":2.0,"Vertegenwoordigers":1.0,"uitleg":1.0,"hun activiteiten":1.0,"Een uitnodiging daarvoor":1.0,"beantwoord":1.0,"De fracties":1.0,"nog deze week":1.0}},"age_hours":2.119045147777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6604,"joy":0.0176,"surprise":0.0449,"sadness":0.019,"fear":0.178,"anger":0.0573,"disgust":0.0227},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the Dutch parliament's attempt to hold social media companies accountable for their role in influencing elections.

Ze werden opgemerkt door boeren die aan het patrouilleren waren in de omgeving. De boeren houden het uitgestrekte gebied zelf in de gaten, omdat het aantal inbraken stijgt en het gebied te groot is voor de politie om goed te controleren. Bij het patrouilleren gebruiken de boeren bijvoorbeeld nachtkijkers om goed in het donker te kunnen zien. Zo konden ze ook afgelopen nacht goed volgen waar de verdachte mannen heen gingen en dit doorgeven aan de politie. Die zette een zoekactie op met verschillende eenheden, een politiehelikopter en twee politiehonden. Op de vlucht Toen de mannen in de gaten kregen dat ze waren opgemerkt, probeerden ze te vluchten.

Eind augustus demonstreerden Dolle Mina's in verschillende steden, waaronder in Groningen. De slogan van het protest was 'De nacht is ook van ons'. De aanranding zou zijn gebeurd rond 22.30 uur in de Groningse binnenstad. \"Een onbekende man probeerde tussen het Zuiderdiep en de Folkingedwarsstraat een jonge vrouw aan te randen\", meldt de politie. De vrouw deed aangifte. \"Dat dit incident plaatsvond tijdens een demonstratie die juist in het teken stond van veiligheid voor vrouwen, maakt de maatschappelijke impact groot.\" De politie sprak getuigen en bekeek videobeelden, maar is op zoek naar aanvullende informatie. Mensen die meer weten of nog beelden hebben, wordt gevraagd dat te delen. Verdachte \"Omdat het incident plaatsvond tijdens een drukbezochte mars met duizenden deelnemers, is het goed mogelijk dat er mensen zijn die beelden hebben gemaakt waarop de verdachte mogelijk te zien is\", schrijft de politie. Ook is zijn signalement gedeeld. Begin september werd aangifte gedaan van aanranding bij het Groningse protest. Een vrouw werd door een onbekende man vastgepakt en op haar mond gezoend. Het is niet duidelijk of dit om hetzelfde incident gaat als waar de politie nu de informatieoproep voor doet. De politie kon dat desgevraagd nog niet bevestigen. Deelnemers lastiggevallen Het was al bekend dat de protesten eind augustus niet vlekkeloos waren verlopen. Zowel in Maastricht als in andere steden waren incidenten, meldden de Dolle Mina's. Daarbij waren voornamelijk mannen betrokken. Zo werd in Eindhoven de route aangepast, omdat omstanders de stoet blokkeerden en deelnemers lastigvielen. In Maastricht werden vrouwen onder meer nagefloten, bedreigd en in de billen geknepen. \"Helaas zijn er landelijk te veel verhalen en nare ervaringen gedeeld over seksuele intimidatie die plaatsvond tijdens onze rustige, maar luide actie\", schreef de Limburgse tak van de feministische beweging.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586456","published_date":"2025-10-14T16:00:03","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.110237","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":308,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2682,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.54,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["bekeek videobeelden","Dolle Mina's"],"locations":["Folkingedwarsstraat","Groningen","Zuiderdiep"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2035,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["aanranding","De nacht","Politie","protest","De politie","die","een poging","een protest","seksueel geweld","Eind"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"aanranding":3.0,"De nacht":3.0,"Politie":2.0,"protest":2.0,"De politie":1.0,"die":1.0,"een poging":1.0,"een protest":1.0,"seksueel geweld":1.0,"Eind":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7237991272222226,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.8200000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.836,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1675,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0095,"sadness":0.016,"fear":0.0407,"anger":0.674,"disgust":0.0875},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reports on a police investigation into sexual assault during a protest.

Uit cijfers die het Centraal Orgaan opvang Asielzoekers (COA) heeft gepubliceerd, blijkt dat er vannacht 2007 mensen verbleven, 7 meer dan toegestaan. Na een rechtszaak die in 2023 was aangespannen door de gemeente Westerwolde, waar Ter Apel onder valt, heeft een rechter de limiet op 2000 asielzoekers vastgesteld. Westerwolde wil dat het aantal asielzoekers binnen de perken blijft, omdat anders de veiligheid in het geding komt. Boete opgelopen tot 750.000 euro Het COA moet voor elke nacht dat het maximumaantal asielzoekers wordt overgeschreden, een dwangsom van 50.000 euro betalen aan de gemeente. De teller staat nu op 750.000 euro. De boete kan in totaal oplopen tot 5 miljoen euro. De limiet werd vannacht voor het eerst in negen dagen overschreden, meldt RTV Noord. De druk op het aanmeldcentrum in Ter Apel neemt deze maand waarschijnlijk iets af door heropening van de noodopvang op een evenemententerrein in Biddinghuizen. Vorig jaar betaalde het COA 1,5 miljoen euro aan boetes aan de gemeente Westerwolde. Een deel van dat geld wordt gebruikt voor de renovatie van het aanmeldcentrum. Later dit jaar besluit de gemeenteraad wat het gaat doen met het geld dat dit jaar door de boetes binnenkomt.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586445","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:15:55","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:37:17.110966","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":207,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1529,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Centraal Orgaan opvang","RTV","COA"],"persons":[],"locations":["gemeente Westerwolde","Asielzoekers","Ter Apel"],"monetary":["50.000 euro","5 miljoen euro","750.000 euro"]},"char_count":1293,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["veel asielzoekers","boete","euro","asielzoekers","het aanmeldcentrum","cijfers","opvang","mensen","een rechtszaak","die"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"veel asielzoekers":3.0,"boete":2.0,"euro":2.0,"asielzoekers":2.0,"het aanmeldcentrum":1.0,"cijfers":1.0,"opvang":1.0,"mensen":1.0,"een rechtszaak":1.0,"die":1.0}},"age_hours":4.459371116388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.842,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8316,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6762,"joy":0.03,"surprise":0.1603,"sadness":0.0462,"fear":0.0343,"anger":0.0304,"disgust":0.0226},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a policy action (court-ordered limit on asylum seekers) and its consequences (fines for exceeding the limit).

In een verklaring zegt Heineken dat de veranderingen op het hoofdkantoor onder meer bedoeld zijn om de onderneming wendbaarder te maken met de nadruk op groei en innovatie. Economische druk De bierbrouwer spreekt van een snel veranderende wereld. \"De geopolitieke en economische druk is reëel, maar dat geldt ook voor de kansen die worden gecreëerd door technologie en veranderende consumententrends\", zegt Van Den Brink. Volgens hem moet het bedrijf voorop blijven lopen en moet de digitale transformatie worden versneld. Eerdere reorganisatie Het is niet de eerste keer dat Heineken reorganiseert. In 2021 kondigde de bierbrouwer aan dat er in een paar jaar tijd 8000 banen wereldwijd zouden verdwijnen, met een jaarlijkse besparing van zo'n 350 miljoen euro. Aanleiding toen waren onder meer tegenvallende resultaten door de coronapandemie.
