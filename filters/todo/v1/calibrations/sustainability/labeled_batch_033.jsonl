In this article, we introduce a framework for measuring net and indirect effects without simplifying these information-rich networks. It captures both direct and indirect interactions, the effect of the whole network on a node, and conversely, the effect of a node on the entire network, while accommodating the complexity of signed, weighted, and directed links. Our taxonomy unifies and extends existing approaches and measures from network science, computational social science, and ecological networks. We demonstrate its value in ecological systems, where net and indirect effects are critical yet difficult to quantify. Using generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics, we find a strong correlation between negative net effects and species extinction. We further apply the framework to a real-world social network, where it identifies informative rankings that illuminate influence propagation and power dynamics.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09190","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.081443","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","physics","preprints","q-biope","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Carlos G\\'omez-Ambrosi, Violeta Calleja-Solanas","raw_content_length":1105,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Lotka-Volterra"],"persons":["arXiv:2501.09190v2 Announce Type:"],"locations":["node"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1104,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Measures","net effects","signed social and ecological networks","a node","arXiv250109190v2 Announce Type","Abstract","improvements","data resolution","quality","researchers"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["researchers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Measures":2.0,"net effects":2.0,"signed social and ecological networks":2.0,"a node":2.0,"arXiv250109190v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"improvements":1.0,"data resolution":1.0,"quality":1.0,"researchers":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787701235,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8766,"joy":0.0244,"surprise":0.0648,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0037,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0093},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a framework for analyzing complex networks, including ecological systems.

A difficulty stems from a fact that a resolution function exhibits rather strong variations in shape, over approximately 10 orders of magnitude in neutron energy. In order to avoid a need for a manual identification of the appropriate analytical forms - hindering past attempts at its parametrization - we take advantage of the versatile machine learning techniques. In particular, we parametrize it by training a multilayer feedforward neural network, relying on a key idea that such networks act as the universal approximators. The proof of concept is presented for a resolution function for the first experimental area of the n_TOF facility, from the third phase of its operation. We propose an optimal network structure for a resolution function in question, which is also expected to be optimal or near-optimal for other experimental areas and for different phases of n_TOF operation. In order to reconstruct several resolution function forms in common use from a single parametrized form, we provide a practical tool in the form of a specialized C++ class encapsulating the computationally efficient procedures suited to the task. Specifically, the class allows an application of a user-specified temporal spread of a primary proton beam (from a neutron production process at n_TOF) to a desired resolution function form.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22220","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.082790","language":"en","tags":["physicscomp-ph","nucl-ex","physics","physicsins-det","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Petar \\v{Z}ugec, Marta Sabate Gilarte, Michael Bacak, Vasilis Vlachoudis, Adria Casanovas, Francisco Garcia Infantes","raw_content_length":1528,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["CERN"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1527,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CERN","Machine learning based parametrization","the resolution function","the first experimental area","EAR1","the n_TOF facility","a resolution function","arXiv250322220v2 Announce Type","Abstract","This study"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine learning based parametrization"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CERN":3.0,"Machine learning based parametrization":2.0,"the resolution function":2.0,"the first experimental area":2.0,"EAR1":2.0,"the n_TOF facility":2.0,"a resolution function":2.0,"arXiv250322220v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7877321172222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8545,"joy":0.0149,"surprise":0.0862,"sadness":0.0117,"fear":0.0186,"anger":0.009,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on improving the parametrization of a resolution function for a neutron beam at CERN using machine learning.

Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05931","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.083453","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","cond-matstat-mech","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Llu\\'is Torres-Hugas, Jordi Duch, Sergio G\\'omez","raw_content_length":1305,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion arXiv:2505.05931v2 Announce Type:"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$d$-path Laplacian"]},"char_count":1304,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Indirect Influence","Network Diffusion","arXiv250505931v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Models","network diffusion","the Laplacian matrix","interactions","direct connections","direct interactions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Indirect Influence":2.0,"Network Diffusion":2.0,"arXiv250505931v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Models":1.0,"network diffusion":1.0,"the Laplacian matrix":1.0,"interactions":1.0,"direct connections":1.0,"direct interactions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7877458249999996,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9184,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0358,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0133,"disgust":0.0117},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on network diffusion and indirect influence.

Here we extend this geometric-dynamic decomposition from the wave-evolution phase to a distinct class of wave scattering problems, where observables (such as frequency, momentum, or position) experience shifts in their expectation values between the input and output wave states. We describe this class of problems using a unitary scattering matrix and the associated generalized Wigner-Smith operator (GWSO), which involves gradients of the scattering matrix with respect to conjugate variables (time, position, or momentum, respectively). We show that both the GWSO and the resulting expectation-values shifts admit gauge-invariant decompositions into dynamic and geometric parts, related respectively to gradients of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the scattering matrix. We illustrate this general theory through a series of examples, including frequency shifts in polarized-light transmission through a time-varying waveplate (linked to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase), momentum shifts at spatially varying metasurfaces, optical forces, beam shifts upon reflection at a dielectric interface, and Wigner time delays in 1D scattering. This unifying framework illuminates the interplay between geometry and dynamics in wave scattering and can be applied to a broad range of physical systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07144","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.084125","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","physics","preprints","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Konstantin Y.

We have employed this new implementation to revisit the calculation of static and frequency-dependent first hyperpolarizabilities of hydrogen halides (HX, X=F-Ts) and the Verdet constant of heavy noble gas atoms (Xe, Rn, Og) and of selected hydrogen halides (HF to HI), in order to investigate the differences and similarities of QR-CC and the more approximate QR-EOMCC. Furthermore, we have determined the relative importance of scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling to these properties, through a comparison of different Hamiltonians, and extended our calculations to superheavy element species (HTs for hyperpolarizabilities, Og for the Verdet constant). Our results show that as one moves towards the bottom of the periodic table, QR-EOMCC can yield rather different results (hyperpolarizabilities) or perform rather similarly (Verdet constant) to QR-CC.

The detector is under development and features a new, radiation-hard, front-end application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designed for beam monitoring applications. The achieved timing resolution of a few nanoseconds enables the measurement of both the luminosity and the beam-induced background. The ASIC, called FBCM23, features six channels with adjustable shaping times, enabling in-field fine-tuning. Each ASIC channel outputs a single binary asynchronous signal encoding time of arrival and time over threshold information. The FBCM is based on silicon-pad sensors, with two sensor designs presently being considered. This paper presents the results of tests of the FBCM detector prototype using both types of silicon sensors with hadron, muon, and electron beams. Irradiated FBCM23 ASICs and silicon-pad sensors were also tested to simulate the expected conditions near the end of the detector's lifetime in the HL-LHC radiation environment. Based on test results, direct bonding between the sensor and ASIC was chosen, and an optimal bias voltage and ASIC threshold for FBCM operation were proposed. The current design of the front-end test board was validated following the beam test and is now being used for the first front-end module, which is expected to be produced in summer 2025. These results represent a major step forward in validating the FBCM concept, first version of the firmware and establishing a reliable design path for the final detector.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05423","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.086114","language":"en","tags":["hep-ex","physics","physicsins-det","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"G.

To extend the simulation of diverse systems and properties, the implementation of continuum embedding models into the Environ library adopts a modular programming paradigm, offering a flexible interface for communication with various DFT programs. The speed and scalability of the current implementation rely on a smooth definition of the key physical properties of the atomistic system, in particular of its electronic density. This has hindered the coupling of Environ with all-electron simulation packages, as the sharp electron density peaks near atomic nuclei are difficult to represent on regular grids. In this work, we introduce a novel smoothing scheme that transforms atom-centered electron densities into a regular grid representation while preserving the accuracy of electrostatic calculations. This approach enables a minimal and generic interface, facilitating seamless interoperability between Environ and all-electron DFT programs. We demonstrate this development through the coupling of Environ with the FHI-aims package and present benchmark simulations that validate the proposed method.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17672","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.087384","language":"en","tags":["research","physicscomp-ph","physics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Jakob Filser, Edan Bainglass, Karsten Reuter, Oliviero Andreussi","raw_content_length":1420,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Environ","DFT","full arXiv:2507.17672v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1419,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["all-electron","continuum embedding models","arXiv250717672v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Recent advances","the incorporation","solvent and electrolyte effects","density functional theory","DFT simulations","material surfaces"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"all-electron":2.0,"continuum embedding models":2.0,"arXiv250717672v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"the incorporation":1.0,"solvent and electrolyte effects":1.0,"density functional theory":1.0,"DFT simulations":1.0,"material surfaces":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787835046388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8113,"joy":0.0885,"surprise":0.0786,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0037,"anger":0.0089,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel smoothing scheme for electron densities in DFT simulations, enabling the coupling of the Environ library with all-electron DFT programs like FHI-aims.

Langmuir turbulence is characterised by multiscale vortical structures, notably counter-rotating roll pairs known as Langmuir circulations. While classic linear stability analyses of the Craik-Leibovich equations have revealed key instability mechanisms underlying Langmuir circulations, the vortical rolls characteristic of Langmuir turbulence, the present work incorporates the turbulent mean state and varying eddy viscosity using data from large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate the turbulence dynamics of fully developed Langmuir turbulence. Scale-dependent resolvent analyses reveal a new formation mechanism of two-dimensional circulating rolls and three-dimensional turbulent coherent vortices through linear amplification of sustained harmonic forcing. Moreover, the integrated energy spectra predicted by the principal resolvent modes in response to broadband harmonic forcing capture the dominant spanwise length scales that are consistent with the LES data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of resolvent analyses in capturing key features of multiscale turbulence-wave interactions in the statistical stationary state of Langmuir turbulence.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14773","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.089405","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicsao-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Anqing Xuan, Lian Shen","raw_content_length":1435,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LES","Langmuir"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1434,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Resolvent model","Langmuir turbulence","Announce Type","Abstract","an analysis","the coherent structures","the ocean surface boundary layer","the interactions","water waves","wind-induced shear"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Resolvent model":2.0,"Langmuir turbulence":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"an analysis":1.0,"the coherent structures":1.0,"the ocean surface boundary layer":1.0,"the interactions":1.0,"water waves":1.0,"wind-induced shear":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787880333888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6667,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0324,"sadness":0.0123,"fear":0.2048,"anger":0.0463,"disgust":0.0251},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new formation mechanism of ocean turbulence using resolvent analysis, validated with LES data.

They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_38c2159bb98e","title":"Neutrino force at all length scales","content":"arXiv:2410.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The Standard Model predicts a long-range force mediated by a pair of neutrinos, known as ``the neutrino force\". It scales as $G_F^2/r^5$, where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant. However, as $r \\lesssim \\sqrt{G_F}$, the four-Fermi theory breaks down and the neutrino force no longer has the $1/r^5$ scaling. For the first time, we derive a complete expression for the neutrino force that is valid at all distances. For $r \\gg \\sqrt{G_F}$, the result reduces to the known $G_F^2/r^5$; for $r \\ll \\sqrt{G_F}$, it scales as $1/r$. We explore the implications of this result for atomic parity violation (APV) experiments. A key feature of the neutrino force is that it is a long-range effect compared to the atomic length scale.

In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime.

Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states.

The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12551","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.097086","language":"en","tags":["cond-matsoft","physics","preprints","physicsbio-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Zongxin Yu, Shuozhen Zhao, Michael J.

Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (<20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05199","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.098419","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physicsapp-ph","cond-matmes-hall","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Dana O.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_5499c769f970","title":"Direct Synthesis of Metal Hydrides from Metal and Acids","content":"arXiv:2506.05481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Reactive metals generally undergo hydrogen evolution rather than forming direct hydrides when reacting with acids. However, an alternative pathway that involves the direct insertion of atomic hydrogen into the metal lattice, analogous to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), can induce extreme localized stresses on the order of gigapascals (GPa). This mechanochemical process significantly promotes the formation of metal hydrides under high-stress conditions. Inspired by this mechanism, we synthesized at least 19 high-purity metal hydrides, including MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, CeH2, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, ZrH1.6, ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH, using bulk metal foils and sulfuric or oleic acid as hydrogen sources. Through high-pressure technique conducted at the GPa level using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), we introduce the pressure concepts Delta-Ph and Delta-Peq to elucidate the synthesis and stabilization mechanisms. Quantitative analysis across all 19 hydrides reveals that the criterion abs(Delta-Peq) greater than Delta-Pph is essential for successful acid-mediated hydride formation; conversely, when abs(Delta-Peq) less than Delta-Pph, hydrogen-induced brittle fracture occurs. This principle not only enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH, but also explains failure mechanisms in metals like Fe. Ultimately, this work repurposes HE from a failure mechanism into a controlled tool for hydride synthesis.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05481","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.100309","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physics","physicschem-ph","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Ankang Chen, Zihao Huo, Jiewen Liu, Chuang Liu, Yongming Sui, Xuan Liu, Qingkun Yuan, Yan Li, Guangtong Wang, Bao Yuan, Defang Duan, Gang Liu, Bo Zou","raw_content_length":1517,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DAC","Ta2H","TaH","Direct Synthesis of Metal Hydrides"],"persons":["Delta-"],"locations":["NbH","ZrH1.6"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1516,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Metal","Acids","arXiv250605481v3","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Reactive metals","hydrogen evolution","direct hydrides","acids","an alternative pathway"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["hydrogen evolution"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Metal":4.0,"Acids":2.0,"arXiv250605481v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Reactive metals":1.0,"hydrogen evolution":1.0,"direct hydrides":1.0,"acids":1.0,"an alternative pathway":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7881353741666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8939999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2212,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7981,"joy":0.0118,"surprise":0.0414,"sadness":0.012,"fear":0.0219,"anger":0.0508,"disgust":0.064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for synthesizing metal hydrides using acids and high pressure.

In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14266","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.100975","language":"en","tags":["cond-matsoft","physics","preprints","physicsbio-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Andreas Ehrmann, Carl P.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 117, 33107 (2020)]. A special example where the gain is low is reminiscent of Klyshko's advanced-wave picture in quantum imaging. Here, we propose and prove a generalized duality for multiple spatial paths connecting a quantum nonlinear interference setup consisting of nondegenerate PDCs and linear optical systems to a linear one, where the PDCs are directly replaced by hypothetical wavelength-shifting BSs. This replacement preserves the geometry of the original setup, and cascaded PDCs become optical cavities whose calculation involves the Redheffer star product.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_4ccd87875981","title":"Determining the density of in","content":"arXiv:2510.00865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Accurate determination of low-density electronic states in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Derivative photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) is employed to estimate the density of states (DOS) of in-gap states. However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. We revealed that PYS signals originate from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of anions, and the biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusion. Because BEE signals mask the DOS contribution, derivative PYS misestimates the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) reliably determines the DOS by separating these components. For a tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) film, CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap and SOMO states over six orders of magnitude, clarifying why the Alq3 layer works effectively in organic light-emitting diodes. In the devices, BEE can act as carrier-generation and degradation processes, and CFS-YS can also probe it. We provide the practical guidelines of low-energy photon measurements for DOS determination, such as measurements of photon-flux dependency.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00865","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.104371","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physicsapp-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Ryotaro Nakazawa, Masaya Kitaoka, Ryota Kaimori, Manato Tateno, Runa Hoshikawa, Yuya Tanaka, Hisao Ishii","raw_content_length":1457,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SOMO","CFS-YS","DOS","photoelectron","PYS","photoelectron effect","BEE"],"persons":["SQEPE"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1456,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the density","gap","PYS","arXiv251000865v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Accurate determination","low-density electronic states","the bandgap","the performance","organic optoelectronic devices"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the density":3.0,"gap":2.0,"PYS":2.0,"arXiv251000865v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Accurate determination":1.0,"low-density electronic states":1.0,"the bandgap":1.0,"the performance":1.0,"organic optoelectronic devices":1.0}},"age_hours":2.788225066388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8576,"joy":0.0173,"surprise":0.0607,"sadness":0.0104,"fear":0.0155,"anger":0.0248,"disgust":0.0138},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The research clarifies a method (CFS-YS) for accurately determining the density of in-gap states in organic semiconductors, which is crucial for optimizing organic optoelectronic devices like OLEDs.

SK3 dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed structural and functional consequences of KCNN3 splicing and genetic variation. Alternative splicing variants of the KCNN3 gene were retrieved from the Ensembl database and aligned using T-Coffee, manually inspected and curated. Protein domains were identified with Pfam 35.0, SMART 9.0, and InterPro 98.0, and visualized. An AlphaFold2 model of SK3 full-length protein (UniProt: Q9UGI6) used as reference and structural models of its splicing variants were predicted with ColabFold. Functional domains (S1–S6 transmembrane helices, H5 pore loop, and calmodulin-binding) were defined and superimposed onto the AlphaFold2 reference. Domain integrity was assessed based on completeness of all expected residue indices within each functional region. SNPs and CNVs across all coding KCNN3 splicing variants were analyzed, classified, and filtered to isolate pathogenic variants prioritizing non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. Differential variant impacts across splicing isoforms were assessed by mapping variant positions to individual transcript protein sequences and used to predict functional consequences. Two long and two short splicing variants are known. Short variants lack the motif required for potassium channels. Pathogenic variants result from missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. In all cases, the consequential effects depend on the specific location and role of the amino acid being changed.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1631536","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:28.459987","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","neuroscience","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":235,"author":"Gabriel A. de Erausquin","raw_content_length":1747,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.175,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["InterPro","Pfam 35.0","T-Coffee"],"persons":["KCNN3","ColabFold","Ensembl"],"locations":[],"monetary":["98.0"]},"char_count":1747,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["silico prediction","the impact","genomic variations","the small conductance calcium","potassium channel SK3 structure","function","the KCNN3 gene","The small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3","a critical role","dopaminergic neuron"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"silico prediction":2.0,"the impact":2.0,"genomic variations":2.0,"the small conductance calcium":2.0,"potassium channel SK3 structure":2.0,"function":2.0,"the KCNN3 gene":2.0,"The small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3":1.0,"a critical role":1.0,"dopaminergic neuron":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7885443061111115,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.6475,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6705,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5466,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0288,"sadness":0.1227,"fear":0.1945,"anger":0.0187,"disgust":0.0838},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on in silico prediction of genomic variations and their impact on SK3 channel structure and function.

While lower-order decompositions reveal large-scale networks, higher-order models provide finer granularity but have been limited by small sample sizes. In this study, we applied sgr-ICA with 500 components to more than 100,000 subjects with rsfMRI to generate a robust fine-grained ICN template. Using this template, we examined whole brain functional network connectivity (FNC) in 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls and compared the findings with a lower order multiscale template. The 500-component template yielded a large set of reliable ICNs, particularly in the cerebellar and paralimbic regions, and revealed schizophrenia-related dysconnectivity patterns that were not detected at larger spatial scales. Specifically, we observed hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains (basal ganglia and thalamus) and hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor and higher cognitive domains. These results demonstrate that very high-order ICA can capture distinct fine-grained ICNs, improving the detection of disease-related connectivity differences and enriching current multiscale ICN templates. The derived ICNs can serve as a valuable reference for future studies and potentially enhance the clinical utility of rsfMRI in psychiatric research.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1672129","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:28.460413","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","open-access","methods","neuroscience","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Armin Iraji","raw_content_length":1468,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ICN","FNC","Spatial","Ultrafine"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1468,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ultrafine brain intrinsic connectivity networks template","very-high-order independent component analysis","sgr-ICA","Spatial group independent component analysis","resting-state fMRI","intrinsic connectivity networks","ICNs","lower-order decompositions","large-scale networks","higher-order models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Ultrafine brain intrinsic connectivity networks template"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ultrafine brain intrinsic connectivity networks template":2.0,"very-high-order independent component analysis":2.0,"sgr-ICA":2.0,"Spatial group independent component analysis":1.0,"resting-state fMRI":1.0,"intrinsic connectivity networks":1.0,"ICNs":1.0,"lower-order decompositions":1.0,"large-scale networks":1.0,"higher-order models":1.0}},"age_hours":6.788559569166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3545000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3291,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9087,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.047,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0079,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on brain connectivity networks and their application in understanding schizophrenia.

Structural equation modeling combined with PROCESS bootstrap analysis was employed to test the hypothesized relationships.ResultsConfirmatory-factor-analysis results indicate satisfactory discriminant validity for all four focal constructs. Empirical evidence shows that: (1) leader trust significantly curbs employee knowledge hiding (β = −0.31, p < 0.001); (2) job satisfaction partially mediates this relationship, with the indirect path accounting for 34 per cent of the total effect (β = 0.46, p < 0.001); and (3) KPO exerts a significant negative moderating influence on both the “leader trust → job satisfaction” path and the overall indirect effect, reducing the mediation coefficient from ?0.17 to ?0.06 under high-KPO conditions (β = −0.23, p < 0.001). These findings remain robust after controlling for organizational support, team competition, and industry heterogeneity.DiscussionThe study enriches the antecedent framework of knowledge hiding by foregrounding vertical trust, illuminating the dynamic tension between reciprocity motivation and resource-defence motivation, and clarifying the double-edged boundary role of psychological ownership.

Providing empirical support for the role that forgiveness from God plays in the lives of Christians, a growing body of literature suggests that divine forgiveness may have important implications for human flourishing. Practical resources that are biblically aligned and developed through interdisciplinary collaboration among humanists (e.g., theologians) and social scientists (e.g., psychologists) could complement traditional religious customs and equip healthcare professionals with spiritually integrated tools for serving self-identifying Christian clients. To this end, we developed the RECEIVE Forgiveness workbook as a brief, self-directed workbook intervention to support Christians in experiencing reconciliation with God after becoming aware of personal sin. This brief report describes the first phase of the workbook development process, including its theoretical foundations, central change objective, and engagement targets. After summarizing feedback from Christian religious leaders, healthcare professionals who serve self-identifying Christian clients/patients, and lay Christians, we describe how this input was incorporated into refinements aimed at strengthening the practical utility of the workbook.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_9e3d9a502b37","title":"The relationship between psychological readiness to return to sport and kinesiophobia in teens and young adults after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","content":"IntroductionPsychological readiness and kinesiophobia are important variables to consider for return to sport clearance after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Both have been associated in adult populations; however, it is unknown if they are associated in teens after ACL reconstruction. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between psychological readiness and kinesiophobia in teens and young adults after ACL reconstruction.MethodsA retrospective cohort design was used. Participants aged 13–30 years, who were 6–12 months post-ACL reconstruction, who completed the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia and the ACL Return-to-Sport after Injury Scale were included from a multi-site registry. Two age groups were established (teen: <19 years, adult: ≥19 years), and psychological readiness was categorized using an ACL Return-to-Sport after Injury Scale cutoff of 77 (<77 = unacceptable). Independent samples t-tests, Pearson correlations, and binary logistic regression were performed to examine associations between kinesiophobia and psychological readiness, and the influences of age, sex, and months since surgery.Results315 participants (54.3% female; 18.3 ± 3.3 years; 8.2 ± 1.9 months post-surgery) were analyzed. ACL Return-to-Sport after Injury Scale and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia scores were significantly correlated in both groups (teen: r = −0.59, p < 0.001; adult: r = −0.45, p < 0.001), with no significant difference in the correlation coefficients (z = −1.49). Overall, 47.9% scored below the ACL Return-to-Sport after Injury pass threshold. Each one-point increase in kinesiophobia was associated with a 28% higher likelihood of reporting unacceptable psychological readiness. Adults were twice as likely as teens to report unacceptable psychological readiness.DiscussionGreater psychological readiness was associated with lower kinesiophobia in both teens and young adults. Additionally, nearly half reported poor psychological readiness, highlighting the need for interventions aimed at improving psychological readiness during ACL rehabilitation.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1623398","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.161038","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":286,"author":"ARROW","raw_content_length":2109,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.43,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ACL","the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia","IntroductionPsychological"],"persons":[],"locations":["kinesiophobia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2109,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["teens","psychological readiness","young adults","ACL reconstruction","The relationship","sport","anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction","IntroductionPsychological readiness","kinesiophobia","important variables"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"teens":4.0,"psychological readiness":3.0,"young adults":3.0,"ACL reconstruction":3.0,"The relationship":2.0,"sport":2.0,"anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction":2.0,"IntroductionPsychological readiness":1.0,"kinesiophobia":1.0,"important variables":1.0}},"age_hours":6.788891889444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7634,"joy":0.0127,"surprise":0.0103,"sadness":0.0157,"fear":0.1439,"anger":0.0139,"disgust":0.0401},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study investigates the relationship between psychological readiness and kinesiophobia after ACL reconstruction.

Due to national policies and economic limitations, most migrant parents opt to leave their children behind in their hometowns and entrusted to other relatives. The prolonged absence of parents, inadequate caretaker ability of other relatives, and limited resources in communal living conditions lead to mental development problems in left-behind children to varying degrees. Such children are more vulnerable to depression, anxiety and loneliness compared to their peers. Thus, the mental health issues of left-behind children ought to receive requisite attention. This paper utilizes the 2013–2014 survey data from the China Education Panel Study (CEPS) for an empirical research aiming to analyze quantitatively the effect of parenting styles on mental health of left-behind children, along with an examination of the mediating role of mental resilience, the results of which are as follows: first, positive parenting behavior significantly reduces mental health problems among left-behind children, whereas positive parenting attitudes do not have a significant effect; second, mental resilience mediates the influence of parenting behavior on children’s mental health but not the effect of parenting attitudes; and third, both positive parenting behavior and parenting attitudes significantly enhance the mental resilience of left-behind children.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1332977","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.161812","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Di Qi","raw_content_length":1494,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CEPS","the China Education Panel Study"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1494,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Parenting styles","the mental health","left-behind children","other relatives","The issue","a prominent social challenge","recent years","Chinas modernization process","national policies","economic limitations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Parenting styles":2.0,"the mental health":2.0,"left-behind children":2.0,"other relatives":2.0,"The issue":1.0,"a prominent social challenge":1.0,"recent years":1.0,"Chinas modernization process":1.0,"national policies":1.0,"economic limitations":1.0}},"age_hours":6.788921699444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8526,"joy":0.0059,"surprise":0.0063,"sadness":0.0649,"fear":0.0173,"anger":0.0144,"disgust":0.0387},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the impact of parenting styles on the mental health of left-behind children in China.

Recent studies have suggested that spontaneous motor tempo (SMT), which refers to the pace of repeated body movements, predicts preferred music tempo. However, the question of whether SMT is related to recalled music tempo remains unanswered. We investigated whether SMT is related to recalled music tempo. The participants in this research performed three tasks—recall (no interval), recall (8-s interval), and preference—in which they adjusted music tempos under different conditions. SMT was assessed on the basis of a finger tapping task. Linear mixed models revealed that while the original music tempo predicted adjustments across tasks, SMT significantly predicted the adjusted tempo in the recall (8-s interval) and preference tasks but not in the recall task (no interval). These results suggest that the rehearsal of music tempo may be influenced by SMT.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1631625","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.162162","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Shigeki Nakauchi","raw_content_length":1012,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Musical","Linear","SMT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1012,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["music","spontaneous motor tempo","SMT","the role","recall","preference","recalled music tempo","Musical experiences","terms","them"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"music":3.0,"spontaneous motor tempo":3.0,"SMT":3.0,"the role":2.0,"recall":2.0,"preference":2.0,"recalled music tempo":2.0,"Musical experiences":1.0,"terms":1.0,"them":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7889377474999995,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8872,"joy":0.0051,"surprise":0.0401,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.0219,"disgust":0.0284},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the relationship between spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and music tempo recall/preference.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_3d88c664de16","title":"The impact of sporting event rituals on the wellbeing of Chinese university students","content":"BackgroundAs China ascends to become the world’s second-largest economy, its position at 68th in the 2024 Global Wellbeing Ranking underscores the persistence of the Easterlin Paradox. University students, who are expected to represent one of the most vibrant and promising social groups, are increasingly affected by mental health issues such as depression, self-harm, and even suicide, indicating that their sense of wellbeing remains insufficient and requires urgent attention. Some scholars argue that happiness is a form of capability that should be cultivated through public education interventions. As the fifth-largest component of China’s wellbeing economy, the sports industry, particularly sports events, which serve as a quintessential form of social ritual, plays a significant role in the pursuit of happiness. Building on this perspective, the present study proposes a theoretical model in which sports event rituals are conceptualized as the independent variable, university students’ wellbeing as the dependent variable, perceived social support as the mediating variable, and physical activity as the moderating variable.MethodsThis study conducted a questionnaire survey among university students in Shanghai, yielding 1,256 valid responses. The data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 24.0 to examine reliability and validity, as well as to test the hypothesized paths through regression analysis.Results(1) Sporting event rituals have a significant positive effect on university students’ perceived wellbeing; (2) Perceived social support plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between sporting event rituals and students’ wellbeing; (3) Physical activity significantly moderates both pathways: it exerts a negative moderating effect on the relationship between sporting event rituals and wellbeing, and a positive moderating effect on the relationship between perceived social support and wellbeing.ConclusionThe findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the social role of sporting event rituals and provide a useful reference for addressing challenges in university sports education within developing country contexts.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1634076","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.162587","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":299,"author":"Bing Liu","raw_content_length":2169,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.495,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2169,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The impact","sporting event rituals","the wellbeing","Chinese university students","China","the worlds second-largest economy","its position","68th","the 2024 Global Wellbeing Ranking","the persistence"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Chinese university students"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The impact":2.0,"sporting event rituals":2.0,"the wellbeing":2.0,"Chinese university students":2.0,"China":1.0,"the worlds second-largest economy":1.0,"its position":1.0,"68th":1.0,"the 2024 Global Wellbeing Ranking":1.0,"the persistence":1.0}},"age_hours":6.788952557777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.2554999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5489,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2364,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.0201,"sadness":0.4572,"fear":0.1812,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0819},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the correlation between sporting event rituals and student wellbeing.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_d9d8abf93465","title":"The effect of physical activity on life satisfaction among sports science students: a moderated mediation model of resilience and mindfulness","content":"BackgroundThis study examines the effect of physical activity (PA) on life satisfaction (LS), focusing on the mediating role of psychological resilience (PR) and the moderating role of mindfulness (MF).MethodParticipants were 363 sports science students (240 male and 123 female). Data were collected through International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, the Life Satisfaction Scale, the Psychological Resilience Scale-Short Form and the Mindfulness Scale. The measurement model was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in AMOS 21 and hypothesis were analyzed using Hayes’ (2022) Process Macro models (4, 1, and 7).ResultsThe mediation effect (Model 4) indicated that the indirect effect of PA on LS through PR was significant. The moderation analysis (Model 1) showed that mindfulness significantly moderated the relationship between PA and PR. Finally, the moderated mediation model (Model 7) confirmed that the indirect effect of PA on LS via PR was stronger at higher levels of mindfulness. Although the effect size was small, it highlights the practical importance of integrating mindfulness in resilience pathways.ConclusionThese findings suggest that physical activity contributes to life satisfaction by enhancing resilience, and that this indirect effect is conditioned by mindfulness. These findings point to the potential value of resilience-building and mindfulness-based programs in educational and psychological practice. However, as the study sample consisted of sports science students from a single faculty, the results should be interpreted with caution regarding generalizability.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1682469","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.162951","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Cristina Corina Bentea","raw_content_length":1622,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Process Macro","the Life Satisfaction Scale","International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form","the Psychological Resilience Scale-Short Form"],"persons":["Hayes"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1622,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["physical activity","life satisfaction","mindfulness","The effect","sports science students","a moderated mediation model","resilience","BackgroundThis study","the effect","the mediating role"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["sports science students","BackgroundThis study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"physical activity":3.0,"life satisfaction":3.0,"mindfulness":3.0,"The effect":2.0,"sports science students":2.0,"a moderated mediation model":2.0,"resilience":2.0,"BackgroundThis study":1.0,"the effect":1.0,"the mediating role":1.0}},"age_hours":6.788967748888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.749,"joy":0.1028,"surprise":0.034,"sadness":0.0128,"fear":0.0334,"anger":0.0352,"disgust":0.0328},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study explores the relationship between physical activity, resilience, mindfulness, and life satisfaction among sports science students.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_40588f6d925d","title":"Cognitive control and metacognitive awareness: do they shape academic achievement in university students?","content":"Cognitive control and metacognition are important processes that significantly influence learning and academic achievement. Cognitive control facilitates goal-directed actions such as planning and monitoring, while metacognition enables individuals to effectively regulate their learning strategies. Although previous research has highlighted the importance of cognitive flexibility, inhibition and metacognitive regulation in academic performance, the interaction among these factors remains understudied. This study examined the relationship between cognitive control, metacognitive awareness (MA) and academic performance, as measured by grade point average (GPA), in university students. Two dimensions of cognitive control, cognitive flexibility and inhibition were measured using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Go/No-Go Task, respectively. Metacognition was assessed through two subscales of the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory: knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. A hierarchical regression analysis revealed that cognitive flexibility was significantly related to GPA, with fewer perseverative errors on the WCST associated with higher GPA. Additionally, regulation of cognition, but not knowledge of cognition, explained further variance. Individuals who reported more frequent use of mental strategies to recognize and control their thinking had higher GPAs. Interestingly, a mediational analysis showed that metacognitive skills did not mediate the cognitive flexibility-GPA relationship. These findings emphasize the independent roles of cognitive flexibility and metacognitive regulation in influencing academic performance. Potential of training programs that target both cognitive control and metacognitive skills for the improvement of academic performance should be addressed in future studies.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1633996","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.164629","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Sara Garcia-Sanz","raw_content_length":1844,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GPA","the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1844,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["academic achievement","university students","Cognitive control","metacognition","important processes","goal-directed actions","planning","monitoring","individuals","their learning strategies"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["academic achievement","university students"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"academic achievement":2.0,"university students":2.0,"Cognitive control":2.0,"metacognition":2.0,"important processes":1.0,"goal-directed actions":1.0,"planning":1.0,"monitoring":1.0,"individuals":1.0,"their learning strategies":1.0}},"age_hours":6.789040415833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.634500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7269,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9094,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0169,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0284,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0135},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the relationship between cognitive skills and academic performance.

The participants were 20 female midi volleyball players (Mean = 11.45; SD = 0.49) with 3 years of volleyball experience from Düzce Volleyball Sports Club. They were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in 24 sessions of children’s yoga, each lasting 40 minutes, at least 3 days per week for 8 weeks, including asanas (postures) and pranayama (breathing) techniques designed for children. The control group did not receive any intervention. Quantitative data were collected using the d2 attention test and Nexus 10 Mk II EEG device, while qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to the quantitative data, and thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data.ResultsThe d2 attention test results indicated significant improvements in TN-E scores for the experimental group compared to the control group (Wilks’ λ = 0.226, F(1,18) = 61.74, p < 0.05). EEG analysis showed significant effects of yoga on frontal theta/beta power ratios: Fz (Wilks’ λ = 0.987, F(1,18) = 19.32, p < 0.05, η2 = 0.518), F7 (Wilks’ λ = 0.692, F(1,18) = 8.01, p < 0.05, η2 = 0.308), and F8 (Wilks’ λ = 0.605, F(1,18) = 11.74, p < 0.05, η2 = 0.395). Qualitative findings indicated that coaches observed higher focus and better responses to strategies among athletes in the yoga group.DiscussionThese findings suggest that children’s yoga practices have a significant impact on improving attention levels and frontal EEG theta/beta ratios, contributing to enhanced neurophysiological indicators of attention. Coaches also reported improvements in concentration and performance-related behaviors. Therefore, children’s yoga practices may be considered as a supportive training tool to enhance young athletes’ performance.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1650897","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.165044","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","frontiers","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":311,"author":"Şirin Pepe","raw_content_length":2086,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.555,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EEG","Nexus","Düzce Volleyball Sports Club"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2086,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["attention levels","The effect","kids yoga practices","frontal EEG theta","beta ratio","IntroductionThe aim","this study","the effects","childrens yoga practices","frontal EEG thetabeta power ratios"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["IntroductionThe aim"],"research_academic":["this study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"attention levels":3.0,"The effect":2.0,"kids yoga practices":2.0,"frontal EEG theta":2.0,"beta ratio":2.0,"IntroductionThe aim":1.0,"this study":1.0,"the effects":1.0,"childrens yoga practices":1.0,"frontal EEG thetabeta power ratios":1.0}},"age_hours":6.789055842222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6878,"joy":0.0404,"surprise":0.0258,"sadness":0.0146,"fear":0.0823,"anger":0.0607,"disgust":0.0883},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the impact of yoga on attention levels in young athletes.

{"id":"science_frontiers_robotics_ai_0d72e42fb54a","title":"Adaptive emergency response and dynamic crowd navigation for mobile robot using deep reinforcement learning","content":"Mobile robots have emerged as a reliable solution for dynamic navigation in real-world applications. Effective deployment in high-density crowds and emergency scenarios requires not only accurate path planning but also rapid adaptation to changing environments. However, autonomous navigation in such environments remains a significant challenge, particularly in time-sensitive applications such as emergency response. Existing path planning and reinforcement learning approaches often lack adaptability to uncertainties and time-varying obstacles, thereby making them less suitable for unstructured real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for dynamic crowd navigation using three algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Deep Q-Network (DQN), is proposed. A context-aware state representation that combines Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based obstacle perception, goal orientation, and robot kinematics to enhance situational awareness is developed. The proposed framework is implemented in a ROS2 Gazebo simulation environment using the TurtleBot3 platform and tested in challenging scenarios to identify the most effective algorithm. Extensive simulation analysis demonstrates that TD3 outperforms the other approaches in terms of success rate, path efficiency, and collision avoidance. This study contributes a reproducible, constraint-aware DRL navigation architecture suitable for real-time, emergency-oriented mobile robot applications.","source":"science_frontiers_robotics_ai","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2025.1612392","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:30.682624","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","robotics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Karthikeyan Ramanujam","raw_content_length":1580,"priority":8,"update_frequency":168,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DRL","DDPG","Mobile"],"persons":["Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient","Deep Q-Network"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1580,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive emergency response","dynamic crowd navigation","mobile robot","deep reinforcement learning","Mobile robots","a reliable solution","dynamic navigation","real-world applications","Effective deployment","high-density crowds"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive emergency response":2.0,"dynamic crowd navigation":2.0,"mobile robot":2.0,"deep reinforcement learning":2.0,"Mobile robots":1.0,"a reliable solution":1.0,"dynamic navigation":1.0,"real-world applications":1.0,"Effective deployment":1.0,"high-density crowds":1.0}},"age_hours":6.78908465,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7495,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5499,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8103,"joy":0.0103,"surprise":0.0162,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.1255,"anger":0.0233,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a DRL framework for robot navigation in emergency scenarios, tested in simulation.

{"id":"science_frontiers_robotics_ai_e361b6a85a18","title":"Modeling trust and its dynamics from physiological signals and embedded measures for operational human","content":"Human-autonomy teaming is an increasingly integral component of operational environments, including crewed and remotely operated space missions, military settings, and public safety. The performance of such teams relies on proper trust in the autonomous system, thus creating an urgent need to capture the dynamic nature of trust and devise objective, non-disruptive means of precisely modeling trust. This paper describes the use of bio-signals and embedded measures to create a model capable of inferring and predicting trust. Data (2304 observations) was collected via human subject testing (n = 12, 7M/5F) during which participants interacted with a simulated autonomous system in an operationally relevant, human-on-the-loop, remote monitoring task and reported their subjective trust via visual analog scales. Electrocardiogram, respiration, electrodermal activity, electroencephalogram, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, eye-tracking, and button click data were collected during each trial. Operator background information were collected prior to the experiment. Features were extracted and algorithmically down-selected, then ordinary least squares regression was used to fit the model, and predictive capabilities were assessed on unseen trials.

At the same time, important information on the architectonics of optically anisotropic supramolecular networks of facies is unknown (inaccessible). In our work, a model of optical anisotropy of the architectonics of supramolecular networks of blood facies is proposed. Algorithms and a methodology for a new multifunctional method of polarization-interference visualization of the Jones matrix and digital layer-by-layer phase reconstruction of optical anisotropy maps (theziograms) have been developed. As a result, statistically significant markers of oncological changes in the polycrystalline architectonics of supramolecular networks of blood facies samples from healthy donors and patients with papillary thyroid cancer at different stages of the oncological process have been determined and physically analyzed. A comparative study of the diagnostic efficiency of Jones matrix theziography (JT) and Mueller matrix diffusion tomography (MDT) of blood facies samples was conducted within the framework of evidence-based medicine. The main advantages of the Jones matrix method are shown: its multifunctionality (complex detection of birefringence and dichroism), high accuracy of early (stage 1: JM—90.4% and MDT—78.8%) and current (stage 2: JM—96.2% and MDT—88.5%) cancer diagnostics and an excellent level (JM—94.2% and MDT—84.6%) of differentiation of papillary thyroid cancer stages.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6262","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:33.510444","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Jun Zheng","raw_content_length":1684,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Polarization-Interference Jones Matrix Sensors of Layer"],"persons":["Jones","Vol","Algorithms"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1614,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Polarization-Interference Jones Matrix Sensors","Layer","facies","the architectonics","date","visual analysis","images","dehydrated films"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Polarization-Interference Jones Matrix Sensors":2.0,"Layer":2.0,"facies":2.0,"the architectonics":2.0,"date":1.0,"visual analysis":1.0,"images":1.0,"dehydrated films":1.0}},"age_hours":6.789495526666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6249,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6925,"joy":0.0119,"surprise":0.0529,"sadness":0.0174,"fear":0.0364,"anger":0.0346,"disgust":0.1545},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for cancer diagnostics using polarization-interference visualization.

The deterioration of engine oil is influenced not only by mileage and usage time but also by subjective factors. Currently, engine oil is replaced in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. At the time of a scheduled oil change, two situations may arise: the degree of lubricant wear may exceed normal levels, in which case the technical systems may also be damaged, with serious consequences for the environment and, implicitly, for human health; or the degree of wear may be low, consistent with normal engine operation, in which case prolonging oil use is recommended, thereby reducing consumption. In this paper, the authors propose a method for diagnosing the engine through periodic analysis of the physico-chemical properties of used engine oil, based on which appropriate vehicle maintenance strategies are issued. Also, recommendations are made for prolonged use of the oil on the condition of its periodic evaluation. Thus, for samples taken from 43 trucks the following physico-chemical properties were analyzed: kinematic viscosity, density, flash point, fuel content, water content, and metal content and their values, for all samples, were within the recommended limits. However, for some samples, more pronounced variations in the values of some properties were found and suitable preventive maintenance recommendations were issued.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8968","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:35.025720","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Liliana Stana","raw_content_length":1461,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1451,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","a Sustainable Model","Consumption","Production","Issuing Suitable Truck Engine Maintenance Recommendations","the Assessment","the Used Oil Wear Degree","Operation","engine oil"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"hydrogen_energy":["Production"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"a Sustainable Model":2.0,"Consumption":2.0,"Production":2.0,"Issuing Suitable Truck Engine Maintenance Recommendations":2.0,"the Assessment":2.0,"the Used Oil Wear Degree":2.0,"Operation":2.0,"engine oil":2.0}},"age_hours":6.790156797777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.5935,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5187,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8432,"joy":0.0356,"surprise":0.0155,"sadness":0.0173,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0409,"disgust":0.041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a method for diagnosing engine health through oil analysis, leading to potentially extended oil use and reduced consumption.

An Explanation Derived from Factor Allocation","content":"Raising rural household income is central to narrowing the rural–urban gap and advancing common prosperity. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this study examines the impact of digital skills, a key for human capital, on rural Chinese households’ income and uses a fixed-effects model and the instrumental variable method to address endogeneity. The study finds that digital skills raise total household income, and each additional skill is associated with an increase of CNY 1678. By skill type, online business skills have the largest effect, followed by work–study skills, while entertainment–social skills are negatively associated with income. Heterogeneity analyses indicate larger gains for households with lower educational attainment and lower income, showing that a stronger regional digital environment amplifies these effects. Mechanism tests point to factor reallocation toward the nonfarm sector, via higher probabilities of off-farm employment and entrepreneurship and improved access to formal credit, as the primary pathway. Consistent with these channels, digital skills increase wages and operating income and reduce inequality in these components, as well as benefitting total income, but they have no detectable effect on property or transfer income or their dispersion. These findings point to key implications for boosting rural income growth and reducing inequality, namely strengthening digital skill development and optimizing the digital environment to enhance rural households’ endogenous income-generating capacity.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8967","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:35.026109","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Chang Liu","raw_content_length":1614,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the China Family Panel Studies","Digital Skills","CNY 1678"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1564,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Digital Skills","Rural Households","Incomes","China","Factor Allocation","digital skills","rural household income","the ruralurban gap"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Digital Skills":2.0,"Rural Households":2.0,"Incomes":2.0,"China":2.0,"Factor Allocation":2.0,"digital skills":2.0,"rural household income":1.0,"the ruralurban gap":1.0}},"age_hours":6.790172959722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9043,"joy":0.0116,"surprise":0.0258,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.012,"anger":0.0178,"disgust":0.0183},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes the impact of digital skills on rural household income in China, finding that each additional skill is associated with an increase of CNY 1678.

In this work, we investigate the symmetric case-namely, symmetric persistent tensors, or equivalently, persistent polynomials. We establish that a symmetric tensor in $\\mathrm{Sym}^n \\mathbb{C}^d$ is persistent if the determinant of its Hessian equals the $d(n-2)$-th power of a nonzero linear form. The converse is verified for cubic tensors ($n=3$) or for $d \\leq 3$, by leveraging classical results of B. Segre. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Hessian of a symmetric persistent tensor factors as the $d$-th power of a form of degree $(n-2)$. Our main results provide an explicit necessary and sufficient criterion for persistence, thereby offering an effective algebraic characterization of this class of tensors.

To this end, following a standard approach, we first consider the algebraic tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. We next define a suitable norm on this linear space. It turns out that, in the p-adic framework, this norm is the analogue of the projective norm associated with the tensor product of real or complex normed spaces. Eventually, by metrically completing the resulting p-adic normed space, and equipping it with a suitable inner product, we obtain the tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces. That this is indeed the correct p-adic counterpart of the tensor product of complex Hilbert spaces is also certified by establishing a natural isomorphism between this p-adic Hilbert space and the corresponding Hilbert-Schmidt class. Since the notion of subspace of a p-adic Hilbert space is highly nontrivial, we finally study the tensor product of subspaces, stressing both the analogies and the significant differences with respect to the standard complex case. These findings should provide us with the mathematical foundations necessary to explore quantum entanglement in the p-adic setting, with potential applications in the emerging field of p-adic quantum information theory.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07504","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.474838","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Paolo Aniello, Lorenzo Guglielmi, Stefano Mancini, Vincenzo Parisi","raw_content_length":1415,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["quantum","Hilbert"],"persons":["Hilbert-Schmidt","Hilbert"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1414,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The tensor product","p-adic Hilbert spaces","arXiv251007504v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","the framework","quantum mechanics","a quadratic extension","the ultrametric field","p-adic numbers"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The tensor product":2.0,"p-adic Hilbert spaces":2.0,"arXiv251007504v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the framework":1.0,"quantum mechanics":1.0,"a quadratic extension":1.0,"the ultrametric field":1.0,"p-adic numbers":1.0}},"age_hours":2.791704494722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8467,"joy":0.0351,"surprise":0.0933,"sadness":0.0041,"fear":0.0047,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on the tensor product of p-adic Hilbert spaces, a mathematical framework potentially relevant to p-adic quantum information theory.

Our analysis relies on a distributional identity between half-space LPP and the Pfaffian Schur process.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_0786fdfffa56","title":"From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player","content":"arXiv:2510.07682v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily; stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive. Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.487337","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","econth","mathematics","preprints","mathca","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Alan Hammond","raw_content_length":1633,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Brownian Boost","Announce Type","Markov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1628,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Brownian Boost","tug","war","explicit ODE solutions","player","arXiv251007682v1","new Abstract","a one-parameter family","stochastic differential games","the real line"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["war"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Brownian Boost":3.0,"tug":2.0,"war":2.0,"explicit ODE solutions":2.0,"player":2.0,"arXiv251007682v1":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a one-parameter family":1.0,"stochastic differential games":1.0,"the real line":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792136936388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.685500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9371,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7803,"joy":0.102,"surprise":0.0904,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0015,"anger":0.0149,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical mathematical model for strategic interaction and resource allocation in a game setting.
