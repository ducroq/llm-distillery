Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations. For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving. Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time, balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09657","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.529376","language":"en","tags":["cslg","eesssp","csai","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni, Christian Marinoni, Fabrizio Frezza, Aurelio Uncini, Danilo Comminiello","raw_content_length":1368,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Helmholtz","GPU","Stable Diffusion","ControlNet"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1367,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Generative Models","Helmholtz Equation Solutions","A Dataset","Acoustic Materials","arXiv251009657v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Accurate simulation","wave propagation","complex acoustic materials","applications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Generative Models":2.0,"Helmholtz Equation Solutions":2.0,"A Dataset":2.0,"Acoustic Materials":2.0,"arXiv251009657v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Accurate simulation":1.0,"wave propagation":1.0,"complex acoustic materials":1.0,"applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7443270636111112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.868,"joy":0.0162,"surprise":0.0506,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0179,"anger":0.0265,"disgust":0.0128},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a dataset and deep learning approach for simulating acoustic materials, potentially reducing computation time compared to traditional methods.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d173d04bb5b5","title":"Gradient","content":"arXiv:2510.09658v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09658","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.529803","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Filippo Rinaldi, Aniello Panariello, Giacomo Salici, Fengyuan Liu, Marco Ciccone, Angelo Porrello, Simone Calderara","raw_content_length":1355,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GradFix"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1354,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251009658v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a new release","a foundation model","practitioners","full fine-tuning","the same task","the previous version","A promising alternative","the parameter changes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251009658v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a new release":1.0,"a foundation model":1.0,"practitioners":1.0,"full fine-tuning":1.0,"the same task":1.0,"the previous version":1.0,"A promising alternative":1.0,"the parameter changes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7443432411111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9067,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0265,"sadness":0.0193,"fear":0.0056,"anger":0.0167,"disgust":0.0186},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a method to improve the efficiency of fine-tuning foundation models, potentially reducing the computational resources (and therefore energy consumption) required for AI development.

In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\\!\\to\\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09660","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.530609","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Luca Scimeca, Thomas Jiralerspong, Berton Earnshaw, Jason Hartford, Yoshua Bengio","raw_content_length":1372,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise arXiv:2510.09660v1","Diffusion Probabilistic Models"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1371,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["What","Steering Diffusion","Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise","arXiv251009660v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Diffusion Probabilistic Models","DPMs","strong generative performance","their inductive biases","this work"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"What":2.0,"Steering Diffusion":2.0,"Spectrally Anisotropic Forward Noise":2.0,"arXiv251009660v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Diffusion Probabilistic Models":1.0,"DPMs":1.0,"strong generative performance":1.0,"their inductive biases":1.0,"this work":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7443747044444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8941,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0394,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.0122,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.016},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to diffusion models, showing improved performance on vision datasets and enabling selective omission of corruptions.

This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative.

To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing, dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt, depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic similarities between image and text modality.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1f2fa114d1e0","title":"LMCache: An Efficient KV Cache Layer for Enterprise","content":"arXiv:2510.09665v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM inference engines and queries. We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries. LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component, decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.

In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining. To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such compression struggled with \\textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer, which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\\times$, and lowers the target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training convergence and model performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.533423","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Huaihai Lyu, Chaofan Chen, Senwei Xie, Pengwei Wang, Xiansheng Chen, Shanghang Zhang, Changsheng Xu","raw_content_length":1819,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Omni Swift Action Tokenizer"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1818,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":[" Compact Action Token","Faster Auto Regression","Announce Type","new Abstract","Existing Vision-Language-Action VLA models","diffusion models","continuous action distributions","computationally heavy iterative denoising","contrast","AR models"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{" Compact Action Token":2.0,"Faster Auto Regression":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Existing Vision-Language-Action VLA models":1.0,"diffusion models":1.0,"continuous action distributions":1.0,"computationally heavy iterative denoising":1.0,"contrast":1.0,"AR models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7444800738888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.764,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9528,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8833,"joy":0.0182,"surprise":0.0525,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0056,"anger":0.0232,"disgust":0.0123},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel action tokenization method (OmniSAT) that reduces training sequence length for Vision-Language-Action models.

At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness.

One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features, exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121 datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility, while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09669","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.534265","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","physicssoc-ph","cscy","preprints","research","computer-science","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Jacopo Lenti, Lorenzo Costantini, Ariadna Fosch, Anna Monticelli, David Scala, Marco Pangallo","raw_content_length":1470,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VAE","Normalizing Flows"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1469,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Population synthesis","geographic coordinates","new Abstract","synthetic populations","explicit coordinates","coarse geographic areas","no established methods","One reason","latitude","longitude"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Population synthesis":2.0,"geographic coordinates":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"synthetic populations":1.0,"explicit coordinates":1.0,"coarse geographic areas":1.0,"no established methods":1.0,"One reason":1.0,"latitude":1.0,"longitude":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744510250555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7559,"joy":0.0074,"surprise":0.0262,"sadness":0.0154,"fear":0.089,"anger":0.0595,"disgust":0.0466},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm for generating synthetic populations with geographic coordinates, which could be used for applications like evacuation planning and transport modeling.

This aging is typically reflected through the resistance growth and the capacity fade of battery cells. Over the years, various charging methods have been presented in the literature that proposed current profiles in order to enable optimal, fast, and/or health-conscious charging. However, very few works have attempted to make the ubiquitous Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) charging protocol adaptive to the changing battery health as it cycles. This work aims to address this gap and proposes a framework that optimizes the constant current part of the CCCV protocol adapting to long-term battery degradation. Specifically, a physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach has been used that not only estimates a key battery degradation mechanism, namely, Loss of Active Material (LAM), but also adjusts the current magnitude of CCCV as a result of this particular degradation. The proposed framework has been implemented by combining PyBamm, an open-source battery modeling tool, and Stable-baselines where the RL agent was trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network. Simulation results show the potential of the proposed framework for enhancing the widely used CCCV protocol by embedding physics information in RL algorithm. A comparative study of this proposed agent has also been discussed with 2 other charging protocols generated by a non-physics-based RL agent and a constant CCCV for all the cycles.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11515","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.988783","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Shanthan Kumar Padisala, Bharatkumar Hegde, Ibrahim Haskara, Satadru Dey","raw_content_length":1544,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning Approach","Reinforcement Learning","CCCV"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1543,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning Approach","Degradation","new Abstract","Batteries","usage and continuous cycling","This aging","the resistance growth","the capacity fade","battery cells","the years"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning Approach"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning Approach":2.0,"Degradation":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Batteries":1.0,"usage and continuous cycling":1.0,"This aging":1.0,"the resistance growth":1.0,"the capacity fade":1.0,"battery cells":1.0,"the years":1.0}},"age_hours":2.759580308888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8584,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0557,"sadness":0.0229,"fear":0.0084,"anger":0.0195,"disgust":0.0259},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach to optimize battery charging protocols, aiming to improve battery health and longevity.

Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\\boldsymbol{y} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called \\emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the measurement space $\\{\\boldsymbol{y}_t\\}$, evolving in parallel with the data-space diffusion $\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_t\\}$, which enables the derivation of a closed-form posterior $p(\\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \\mid \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09676","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.537184","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","csai","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Shayan Mohajer Hamidi, En-Hui Yang, Ben Liang","raw_content_length":1416,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1415,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Coupled Data","Measurement Space Dynamics","Enhanced Diffusion Posterior Sampling","arXiv251009676v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Inverse problems","the goal","an unknown signal","noisy or incomplete measurements","applications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Coupled Data":2.0,"Measurement Space Dynamics":2.0,"Enhanced Diffusion Posterior Sampling":2.0,"arXiv251009676v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Inverse problems":1.0,"the goal":1.0,"an unknown signal":1.0,"noisy or incomplete measurements":1.0,"applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7446121108333332,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8988,"joy":0.0068,"surprise":0.021,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0197,"anger":0.0258,"disgust":0.0206},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework for solving inverse problems using diffusion models, potentially improving accuracy in applications like medical imaging and remote sensing.

While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12 over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education, leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09677","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.537627","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscy","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Ebrahim Rahimi, Clara Maathuis","raw_content_length":1719,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Computational Thinking Education","A Systematic Literature Review arXiv:2510.09677v1","Computational Thinking"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1718,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Computational Thinking Education","Higher Education","higher education","CT education","arXiv251009677v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Computational Thinking","a key skill","students","an increasingly technology-driven future"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Computational Thinking Education":2.0,"Higher Education":2.0,"higher education":2.0,"CT education":2.0,"arXiv251009677v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Computational Thinking":1.0,"a key skill":1.0,"students":1.0,"an increasingly technology-driven future":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7446276722222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.787,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.137,"sadness":0.0109,"fear":0.0312,"anger":0.0166,"disgust":0.0077},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a systematic literature review, so it's primarily about research and analysis, not concrete action.

In situ measurement approaches, like eddy covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM - and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE = 8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class correspondence.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11505","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.986393","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Aleksei Rozanov, Samikshya Subedi, Vasudha Sharma, Bryan C.

Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net, existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\\_UNet Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of the art in automated brain tumor analysis.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.538429","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Sashank Makanaboyina","raw_content_length":1444,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation arXiv:2510.09681v1 Announce","U-Net","NNDM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1443,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["NNDM","Diffusion Model","Brain Tumor Segmentation","arXiv251009681v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Accurate detection","segmentation","brain tumors","magnetic resonance imaging","MRI"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Brain Tumor Segmentation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"NNDM":2.0,"Diffusion Model":2.0,"Brain Tumor Segmentation":2.0,"arXiv251009681v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Accurate detection":1.0,"segmentation":1.0,"brain tumors":1.0,"magnetic resonance imaging":1.0,"MRI":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7446587819444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7586,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0212,"sadness":0.0203,"fear":0.1475,"anger":0.0307,"disgust":0.0156},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel AI model for brain tumor segmentation, demonstrating improved performance on a benchmark dataset.

However, the recent surge of AI-generated surveys, especially enabled by large language models (LLMs), has transformed this traditionally labor-intensive genre into a low-effort, high-volume output. While such automation lowers entry barriers, it also introduces a critical threat: the phenomenon we term the \"survey paper DDoS attack\" to the research community. This refers to the unchecked proliferation of superficially comprehensive but often redundant, low-quality, or even hallucinated survey manuscripts, which floods preprint platforms, overwhelms researchers, and erodes trust in the scientific record. In this position paper, we argue that we must stop uploading massive amounts of AI-generated survey papers (i.e., survey paper DDoS attack) to the research community, by instituting strong norms for AI-assisted review writing. We call for restoring expert oversight and transparency in AI usage and, moreover, developing new infrastructures such as Dynamic Live Surveys, community-maintained, version-controlled repositories that blend automated updates with human curation. Through quantitative trend analysis, quality audits, and cultural impact discussion, we show that safeguarding the integrity of surveys is no longer optional but imperative to the research community.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09686","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.540113","language":"en","tags":["cscy","csai","preprints","research","cscl","csir","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Jianghao Lin, Rong Shan, Jiachen Zhu, Yunjia Xi, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang","raw_content_length":1503,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Research Community","DDoS"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1502,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DDoS","the Research Community","new Abstract","Survey papers","the scholarly progress","research communities","structured overviews","both novices","experts","disciplines"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["the Research Community","research communities"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DDoS":2.0,"the Research Community":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Survey papers":1.0,"the scholarly progress":1.0,"research communities":1.0,"structured overviews":1.0,"both novices":1.0,"experts":1.0,"disciplines":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744717098888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6904,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0081,"sadness":0.0093,"fear":0.2151,"anger":0.0407,"disgust":0.0292},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a solution to the problem of AI-generated survey papers flooding the research community.

The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09687","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.540528","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Stanis{\\l}aw Pawlak","raw_content_length":1193,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Neural Networks arXiv:2510.09687v1 Announce Type","the Occurence of Critical Learning Periods"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1192,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Occurence","Critical Learning Periods","Neural Networks","arXiv251009687v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This study","the plasticity","neural networks","empirical support","the notion"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Neural Networks","neural networks"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Occurence":2.0,"Critical Learning Periods":2.0,"Neural Networks":2.0,"arXiv251009687v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"the plasticity":1.0,"neural networks":1.0,"empirical support":1.0,"the notion":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744731508055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.469,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9062,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.872,"joy":0.0162,"surprise":0.0369,"sadness":0.0233,"fear":0.0146,"anger":0.0163,"disgust":0.0208},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores improving neural network training efficiency, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption in AI applications.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a6c84d07766e","title":"A Hybrid Agent","content":"arXiv:2510.09688v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid approach to predict the evolution of technological maturity in R and D projects, using the oil and gas sector as an example. Integrating System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based Modelling (ABM) allows the proposed multi level framework to capture uncertainties in work effort, team size, and project duration, which influence technological progress. While AB SD hybrid models are established in other fields, their use in R and D remains limited. The model combines system level feedback structures governing work phases, rework cycles, and duration with decentralised agents such as team members, tasks, and controllers, whose interactions generate emergent project dynamics. A base case scenario analysed early stage innovation projects with 15 parallel tasks over 156 weeks. A comparative sequential scenario showed an 88 percent reduction in rework duration. A second scenario assessed mixed parallel sequential task structures with varying team sizes. In parallel configurations, increasing team size reduced project duration and improved task completion, with optimal results for teams of four to five members. These findings align with empirical evidence showing that moderate team expansion enhances coordination efficiency without excessive communication overhead. However, larger teams may decrease performance due to communication complexity and management delays. Overall, the model outputs and framework align with expert understanding, supporting their validity as quantitative tools for analysing resource allocation, scheduling efficiency, and technology maturity progression.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09688","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.540964","language":"en","tags":["csma","statap","preprints","statme","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"R.

We investigate red teaming for LLMs with web search and present CREST-Search, a framework that systematically exposes risks in such systems.

We further construct WebSearch-Harm, a search-specific dataset to fine-tune LLMs into efficient red-teaming agents.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_418bfee798f9","title":"Evaluation of Differential Privacy Mechanisms on Federated Learning","content":"arXiv:2510.09691v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget. However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem, adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator.

This dissertation presents a unified comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks (WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the study to a laser-driven case of Schr\\\"odinger's equation via the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation. Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs), forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning, network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case, indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks. We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible, scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09693","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.542724","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Jiakang Chen","raw_content_length":1746,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DRM","PDE","Ritz","Physics Constraints","Kramers-Henneberger"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$L_2$","10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$"]},"char_count":1741,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PINNs","DRM","WANs","Neural PDE Solvers","Physics Constraints","A Comparative Study","arXiv251009693v1 Announce Type","new Abstract Partial differential equations","PDEs","models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Physics Constraints"],"research_academic":["A Comparative Study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PINNs":3.0,"DRM":3.0,"WANs":3.0,"Neural PDE Solvers":2.0,"Physics Constraints":2.0,"A Comparative Study":2.0,"arXiv251009693v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract Partial differential equations":1.0,"PDEs":1.0,"models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744808927222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.194,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8676,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0359,"sadness":0.0237,"fear":0.0147,"anger":0.0262,"disgust":0.0257},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a comparative study of neural PDE solvers, achieving low L2 errors (10^-6 - 10^-9) on Poisson problems and the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation.

Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications, we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides, for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09694","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.543134","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Xiaodan Li, Mengjie Wu, Yao Zhu, Yunna Lv, YueFeng Chen, Cen Chen, Jianmei Guo, Hui Xue","raw_content_length":1465,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head","Latent Dynamics arXiv:2510.09694v1 Announce Type","SLD","Anchored Temporal Consistency","ATC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1464,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Kelp","A Streaming Safeguard","Large Models","Latent Dynamics","arXiv251009694v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large models","LMs","powerful content generators","their open-ended nature"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Kelp":3.0,"A Streaming Safeguard":2.0,"Large Models":2.0,"Latent Dynamics":2.0,"arXiv251009694v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large models":1.0,"LMs":1.0,"powerful content generators":1.0,"their open-ended nature":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7448245575,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5358,"joy":0.0182,"surprise":0.0111,"sadness":0.0128,"fear":0.2849,"anger":0.0782,"disgust":0.059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework (Kelp) for real-time risk detection in large language models, improving accuracy (15.61% higher average F1) with minimal latency (less than 0.5 ms per token).

While these methods are very effective in reducing memory, computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON), a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies. Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09696","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.543947","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Lorenzo Nikiforos, Charalampos Antoniadis, Luciano Prono, Fabio Pareschi, Riccardo Rovatti, Gianluca Setti","raw_content_length":1337,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VCON","Smoothly Transition Neural Models","Compressed Form arXiv:2510.09696v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1336,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Vanishing Contributions","A Unified Approach","Smoothly Transition Neural Models","Compressed Form","arXiv251009696v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The increasing scale","deep neural networks","a growing need","compression techniques"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Vanishing Contributions":3.0,"A Unified Approach":2.0,"Smoothly Transition Neural Models":2.0,"Compressed Form":2.0,"arXiv251009696v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The increasing scale":1.0,"deep neural networks":1.0,"a growing need":1.0,"compression techniques":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744854041111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.100499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4201,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6683,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0144,"sadness":0.0147,"fear":0.132,"anger":0.0868,"disgust":0.0789},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (VCON) for compressing neural networks, which could lead to reduced energy consumption in computation.

However, securing these models against jailbreak attacks continues to be a substantial challenge. Unlike text-only models, VLMs integrate additional modalities, introducing novel vulnerabilities such as image hijacking, which can manipulate the model into producing inappropriate or harmful responses. Drawing inspiration from text-based jailbreaks like the \"Do Anything Now\" (DAN) command, this work introduces VisualDAN, a single adversarial image embedded with DAN-style commands. Specifically, we prepend harmful corpora with affirmative prefixes (e.g., \"Sure, I can provide the guidance you need\") to trick the model into responding positively to malicious queries. The adversarial image is then trained on these DAN-inspired harmful texts and transformed into the text domain to elicit malicious outputs. Extensive experiments on models such as MiniGPT-4, MiniGPT-v2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA reveal that VisualDAN effectively bypasses the safeguards of aligned VLMs, forcing them to execute a broad range of harmful instructions that severely violate ethical standards. Our results further demonstrate that even a small amount of toxic content can significantly amplify harmful outputs once the model's defenses are compromised. These findings highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against image-based attacks and offer critical insights for future research into the alignment and security of VLMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09699","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.544781","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Aofan Liu, Lulu Tang","raw_content_length":1602,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Visual arXiv:2510.09699v1 Announce Type","DAN","Vision-Language Models"],"persons":["VisualDAN"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1601,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["VLMs","VisualDAN","Vulnerabilities","Visual","arXiv251009699v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Vision-Language Models","significant attention","their remarkable ability","multimodal content"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"VLMs":4.0,"VisualDAN":2.0,"Vulnerabilities":2.0,"Visual":2.0,"arXiv251009699v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Vision-Language Models":1.0,"significant attention":1.0,"their remarkable ability":1.0,"multimodal content":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744883665833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7374,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0283,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.1434,"anger":0.0534,"disgust":0.0224},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies vulnerabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that could lead to the generation of harmful content.

However, these simulations become computationally intractable for renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations. The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance.

Existing research often involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset, STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%.

Several approaches have been proposed to apply LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences, they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking.

Existing defenses often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving significant improvements in both generation robustness and output trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09710","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.547249","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Xiaonan Si, Meilin Zhu, Simeng Qin, Lijia Yu, Lijun Zhang, Shuaitong Liu, Xinfeng Li, Ranjie Duan, Yang Liu, Xiaojun Jia","raw_content_length":1548,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SeCon-RAG","EIRE"],"persons":["RAG"],"locations":["analy"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1547,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SeCon-RAG","Announce Type","new Abstract Retrieval-augmented generation RAG systems","large language models","LLMs","external knowledge","corpus poisoning and contamination attacks","which","output integrity","Existing defenses"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SeCon-RAG":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract Retrieval-augmented generation RAG systems":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"external knowledge":1.0,"corpus poisoning and contamination attacks":1.0,"which":1.0,"output integrity":1.0,"Existing defenses":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7449718161111107,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5175000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8965,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6294,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.013,"sadness":0.0287,"fear":0.212,"anger":0.0665,"disgust":0.0459},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach to improving the trustworthiness of RAG systems, which could indirectly support sustainability efforts by ensuring information integrity.

However, existing LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance. To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level compatibility.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_b475b590902e","title":"A Scalable, Privacy","content":"arXiv:2510.09715v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the proliferation of decentralized applications (DApps), the conflict between the transparency of blockchain technology and user data privacy has become increasingly prominent. While Decentralized Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) provide a standardized framework for user data sovereignty, achieving trusted identity verification and data sharing without compromising privacy remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework that integrates DIDs and VCs with efficient Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) schemes to address this core issue. The key contributions of this framework are threefold: first, it constructs a set of strong privacy-preserving protocols based on zk-STARKs, allowing users to prove that their credentials satisfy specific conditions (e.g., \"age is over 18\") without revealing any underlying sensitive data. Second, it designs a scalable, privacy-preserving credential revocation mechanism based on cryptographic accumulators, effectively solving credential management challenges in large-scale scenarios. Finally, it integrates a practical social key recovery scheme, significantly enhancing system usability and security. Through a prototype implementation and performance evaluation, this paper quantitatively analyzes the framework's performance in terms of proof generation time, verification overhead, and on-chain costs. Compared to existing state-of-the-art systems based on zk-SNARKs, our framework, at the cost of a larger proof size, significantly improves prover efficiency for complex computations and provides stronger security guarantees, including no trusted setup and post-quantum security. Finally, a case study in the decentralized finance (DeFi) credit scoring scenario demonstrates the framework's immense potential for unlocking capital efficiency and fostering a trusted data economy.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09715","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.548922","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csni","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Hui Yuan","raw_content_length":1927,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Verifiable Credentials","DApps","Decentralized Identity"],"persons":["Zero-Knowledge"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1926,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Privacy","arXiv251009715v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the proliferation","decentralized applications","DApps","the conflict","the transparency","blockchain technology","user data privacy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["blockchain technology"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Privacy":2.0,"arXiv251009715v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the proliferation":1.0,"decentralized applications":1.0,"DApps":1.0,"the conflict":1.0,"the transparency":1.0,"blockchain technology":1.0,"user data privacy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745031841111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.953,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7906,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8541,"joy":0.0261,"surprise":0.0297,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0389,"anger":0.0302,"disgust":0.0135},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper proposes a novel framework for privacy-preserving data sharing using DIDs, VCs, and ZKPs.

Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.856748","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Runyang Feng, Hyung Jin Chang, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Boeun Kim, Yi Chang, Yixing Gao","raw_content_length":1730,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VHPE","Mamba","Global arXiv:2510.11017v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1729,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling","Global","arXiv251011017v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations","both global dynamic contexts","eg holistic human motion tendencies","local motion details","eg high-frequency changes"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling","Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations"],"ai_ml":["local motion details"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling":2.0,"Global":2.0,"arXiv251011017v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations":1.0,"both global dynamic contexts":1.0,"eg holistic human motion tendencies":1.0,"local motion details":1.0,"eg high-frequency changes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7557453597222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9079,"joy":0.0122,"surprise":0.0463,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0103,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal modeling for video-based human pose estimation.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d015116979bf","title":"ICL","content":"arXiv:2510.09719v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router.

Integrating long-term memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW) with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its effectiveness in long-term conversations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09720","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.550520","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Haoran Sun, Zekun Zhang, Shaoning Zeng","raw_content_length":1289,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EMA","Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU","LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1288,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Preference","memory","Announce Type","new Abstract","the key factors","the reasoning capabilities","LLM-based agents","their ability","long-term memory","long-term memory mechanisms"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM-based agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Preference":2.0,"memory":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the key factors":1.0,"the reasoning capabilities":1.0,"LLM-based agents":1.0,"their ability":1.0,"long-term memory":1.0,"long-term memory mechanisms":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7450893980555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8957,"joy":0.013,"surprise":0.013,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0291,"anger":0.0239,"disgust":0.0211},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new memory update mechanism (PAMU) for LLM-based agents.

This survey presents the first holistic analysis of LLM-empowered software engineering, bridging the critical gap between evaluation and solution approaches. We analyze 150+ recent papers and organize them into a comprehensive taxonomy spanning two major dimensions: (1) Solutions, categorized into prompt-based, fine-tuning-based, and agent-based paradigms, and (2) Benchmarks, covering code generation, translation, repair, and other tasks. Our analysis reveals how the field has evolved from simple prompt engineering to complex agentic systems incorporating planning and decomposition, reasoning and self-refinement, memory mechanisms, and tool augmentation. We present a unified pipeline that illustrates the complete workflow from task specification to final deliverables, demonstrating how different solution paradigms address varying complexity levels across software engineering tasks. Unlike existing surveys that focus on isolated aspects, we provide full-spectrum coverage connecting 50+ benchmarks with their corresponding solution strategies, enabling researchers to identify optimal approaches for specific evaluation criteria.

This unified recognition stage performs character identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification. Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues, enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion, and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10533","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.737432","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Elham Shabaninia, Fatemeh Asadi-zeydabadi, Hossein Nezamabadi-pour","raw_content_length":1332,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IR-LPR","OCR","ALPR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1331,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Layout","Announce Type","new Abstract","This work","a pattern-aware framework","automatic license plate recognition","ALPR","diverse plate layouts","challenging real-world conditions","The proposed system"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Layout":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This work":1.0,"a pattern-aware framework":1.0,"automatic license plate recognition":1.0,"ALPR":1.0,"diverse plate layouts":1.0,"challenging real-world conditions":1.0,"The proposed system":1.0}},"age_hours":2.75194445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8718,"joy":0.0391,"surprise":0.0705,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0042,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0026},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel ALPR system with improved accuracy and robustness.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_bd81c02b286e","title":"InteractScience: Programmatic and Visually","content":"arXiv:2510.09724v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of generating complete applications from natural language instructions, creating new opportunities in science and education. In these domains, interactive scientific demonstrations are particularly valuable for explaining concepts, supporting new teaching methods, and presenting research findings. Generating such demonstrations requires models to combine accurate scientific knowledge with the ability to implement interactive front-end code that behaves correctly and responds to user actions. This capability goes beyond the scope of existing benchmarks, which typically evaluate either knowledge question answering without grounding in code or static web code generation without scientific interactivity. To evaluate this integrated ability, we design a hybrid framework that combines programmatic functional testing to rigorously verify interaction logic with visually-grounded qualitative testing to assess rendered outputs against reference snapshots. Building on this framework, we present InteractScience, a benchmark consisting of a substantial set of carefully designed questions across five scientific domains, each paired with unit tests, reference snapshots, and checklists. We evaluate 30 leading open- and closed-source LLMs and report results that highlight ongoing weaknesses in integrating domain knowledge with interactive front-end coding. Our work positions InteractScience as the first benchmark to automatically measure this combined capability with realistic interactive operations, providing a foundation for advancing reliable and educationally useful scientific demonstration code generation.

Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist, reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases: 1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code, and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09726","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.552564","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","cspl","preprints","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Tilman Hinnerichs, Reuben Gardos Reid, Jaap de Jong, Bart Swinkels, Pamela Wochner, Nicolae Filat, Tudor Magurescu, Issa Hanou, Sebastijan Dumancic","raw_content_length":1153,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Julia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1152,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Herbjl","A Unifying Program Synthesis Library","arXiv251009726v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Program synthesis","the automatic generation","code","a specification","the most fundamental tasks","artificial intelligence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["artificial intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Herbjl":2.0,"A Unifying Program Synthesis Library":2.0,"arXiv251009726v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Program synthesis":1.0,"the automatic generation":1.0,"code":1.0,"a specification":1.0,"the most fundamental tasks":1.0,"artificial intelligence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7451593072222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.088000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8176,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.814,"joy":0.0688,"surprise":0.0957,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0049,"anger":0.0077,"disgust":0.0026},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a program synthesis library, Herb.jl, which aims to improve the efficiency of AI development.

They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations - Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and 0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability. The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09730","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.553370","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Thi Bich Phuong Man, Luu Tu Nguyen, Vu Tram Anh Khuong, Thanh Ha Le, Thi Duyen Ngo","raw_content_length":1574,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Adaptive","MER","Adaptive Fusion Network"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1573,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive Fusion Network","Motion","arXiv251009730v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Micro","expressions","MEs","subtle transient facial changes","very low intensity"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Micro"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive Fusion Network":2.0,"Motion":2.0,"arXiv251009730v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Micro":1.0,"expressions":1.0,"MEs":1.0,"subtle transient facial changes":1.0,"very low intensity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7451891425,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2025,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8405,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.874,"joy":0.0421,"surprise":0.0252,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.024,"anger":0.0109,"disgust":0.0202},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for micro-expression recognition using an adaptive fusion network.

These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However, deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups, overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex, real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and adaptive CVS.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09731","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.553993","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":261,"author":"Muhammad Munsif, Waqas Ahmad, Amjid Ali, Mohib Ullah, Adnan Hussain, Sung Wook Baik","raw_content_length":1953,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.305,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multi View Analytics","Connected Vision Systems"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1952,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Multi Camera Connected Vision System","Multi View Analytics","A Comprehensive Survey","CVS","MVMC","arXiv251009731v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Connected Vision Systems","a variety","applications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Multi Camera Connected Vision System":2.0,"Multi View Analytics":2.0,"A Comprehensive Survey":2.0,"CVS":2.0,"MVMC":2.0,"arXiv251009731v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Connected Vision Systems":1.0,"a variety":1.0,"applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745205705833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8585,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7717,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8972,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0567,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0165,"anger":0.0101,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a survey paper, so it primarily summarizes existing research.
