The case of a thin plate at zero incidence is first considered. Despite the absence of absolute instability region, global stability analysis reveals the existence of numerous unstable eigenvalues organized along a characteristic \"arc-branch\" whose properties significantly depends upon the size of the numerical domain. These arc-branch modes are explained as resulting from a non-local pressure perturbation spuriously generated at the outlet of the domain due to the no-stress boundary condition, which then triggers the shedding of vortical structures at the trailing edge of the plate. The case of NACA0012 wing profiles at small incidences is then considered. Global stability analysis reveals that both the non-local spurious feedback mechanism and the classical local feedback mechanism are active. Trying to suppress the spurious feedback by enlarging the size of the numerical domain is shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, filtering methods suppressing the exponential spatial growth of perturbations, with either a sponge or a complex mapping, are found to be efficient. Thanks to these ideas, the critical Reynolds number and Strouhal number at onset can eventually be computed and are mapped for incidences in the range $ \\alpha \\in [0^o - 5 ^o]$. It is postulated that the non-local feedback mechanism evidenced here could be at play in other strongly convective flows.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11880","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.030003","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"David Fabre","raw_content_length":1653,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["small inc"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1652,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the transition","the wake","slender bodies","an artefact","boundary conditions","arXiv251011880v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","This work","2D slender bodies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the transition":3.0,"the wake":3.0,"slender bodies":2.0,"an artefact":2.0,"boundary conditions":2.0,"arXiv251011880v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This work":1.0,"2D slender bodies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751130449444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7725,"joy":0.0116,"surprise":0.0508,"sadness":0.0134,"fear":0.1146,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0183},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the numerical modeling of fluid dynamics around slender bodies, specifically focusing on the transition to unsteadiness in the wake.

However, the extended interaction times enabled by these cavities often come at the cost of slow optical read-out protocols and limited control over system transients. To address this challenge, we demonstrate an ultrafast intra-cavity optical gating scheme in a high-finesse, second-order nonlinear microcavity incorporating a thin-film of lithium niobate. A femtosecond optical gate pulse -- tuned to the transparency region of the cavity's dielectric mirrors -- achieves instantaneous up-conversion of the intra-cavity field via sum-frequency generation. The resulting upconverted signal exits the cavity as a short pulse, providing space- and time-resolved, on-demand access to the intra-cavity state. We validate this approach by tracking the dynamics of multiple resonant modes excited in a plano-concave distributed Bragg reflector microcavity, showing close agreement with analytical models. Additionally, we demonstrate that stimulated intra-cavity difference-frequency generation can efficiently instantiate cavity modes on femtosecond timescales. This gating scheme is fully compatible with low-temperature microcavity experiments, paving the way for advanced quantum state storage, retrieval, and real-time control of light-matter interactions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11965","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.033972","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Ouri Karni, Chirag Vaswani, Thibault Chervy","raw_content_length":1568,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["arXiv:2510.11965v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1567,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ultrafast optical gating","a nonlinear lithium niobate microcavity","arXiv251011965v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","optical simulation","computational techniques","interest","high-finesse optical cavities","applications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ultrafast optical gating":2.0,"a nonlinear lithium niobate microcavity":2.0,"arXiv251011965v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"optical simulation":1.0,"computational techniques":1.0,"interest":1.0,"high-finesse optical cavities":1.0,"applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751273933611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.845,"joy":0.0311,"surprise":0.0886,"sadness":0.0092,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel optical gating scheme using lithium niobate microcavities.

To develop students' ability for solving problems that can be solved effectively using Laplace's equation in an upper-level electricity and magnetism course, we developed and validated a tutorial focused on finding electrostatic potential in a Cartesian coordinate system. The tutorial was implemented across three instructors' classes, accompanied by scaffolded pretest and posttest. We also conducted think-aloud interviews with advanced students using both unscaffolded and scaffolded versions of the pretest and posttest. Findings reveal common student difficulties that were included in the tutorial as a guide to help address them. The difference in the performance of students from the pretest to the posttest was similar on the scaffolded version of the tests for all three instructors' classes and interviewed students. Equally importantly, interviewed students demonstrated greater differences in scores from the pretest and posttest on the unscaffolded versions, suggesting that the scaffolded version of the tests may have obscured evidence of actual learning from the tutorial. While a scaffolded test is typically intended to guide students through complex reasoning by breaking a problem into sub-problems and offering structured support, it can limit opportunities to demonstrate independent problem-solving and evidence of learning from the tutorial. Additionally, one instructor's class underperformed relative to others even on the pretest.

Traffic conflict indicators such as time-to-collision (TTC) provide continuous measures of collision proximity but require thresholds to distinguish routine from safety-critical interactions. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) offers statistically defined thresholds, yet these do not necessarily represent how drivers perceive and respond to conflict. This study introduces a behavioural modelling framework that identifies candidate behavioural thresholds (CBTs) by explicitly modelling how drivers adjust their movements under conflict conditions. The framework is based on a Latent Class Logit Kernel (LC-LK) model that captures inter-class heterogeneity (routine vs. defensive driving) and intra-class correlation between overlapping spatial alternatives. This yields probability curves showing how the likelihood of defensive manoeuvres varies with conflict indicators, from which CBTs such as inflection points and crossovers can be extracted. The framework tests four hypotheses: (1) drivers exhibit varying degrees of membership in both low- and high-risk classes; (2) membership shifts systematically with conflict values, revealing behavioural thresholds; (3) this relationship follows a logistic shape, with stable behaviour at safe levels and rapid transitions near critical points; and (4) even in free flow, drivers maintain a baseline caution level. Application to naturalistic roundabout trajectories revealed stable TTC thresholds (0.8-1.1 s) but unstable MTTC2 estimates (e.g., 34 s), suggesting cognitive limits in processing complex indicators. Overall, the framework complements EVT by offering a structured, behaviourally grounded method for identifying and validating thresholds in surrogate safety analysis.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12012","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.035618","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicssoc-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Rulla Al-Haideri, Changhe Liu, Karim Ismail, Bilal Farooq, Chi Zhang","raw_content_length":1888,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Extreme Value Theory","TTC","EVT","Conflict Indicator Profiles arXiv:2510.12012v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1887,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Latent Class Logit Kernel Framework","Surrogate Safety","Behavioural Thresholds","Conflict Indicator Profiles","Announce Type","new Abstract","Crash data","road safety","proactive safety management","Traffic conflict indicators"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Latent Class Logit Kernel Framework":2.0,"Surrogate Safety":2.0,"Behavioural Thresholds":2.0,"Conflict Indicator Profiles":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Crash data":1.0,"road safety":1.0,"proactive safety management":1.0,"Traffic conflict indicators":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751331687777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.609,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7218,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5698,"joy":0.0051,"surprise":0.0085,"sadness":0.0123,"fear":0.3089,"anger":0.0573,"disgust":0.0382},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a behavioural modelling framework for identifying behavioural thresholds in surrogate safety analysis.

In the small deformation limit, the coupled electroporation, electrohydrodynamics and membrane mechanics are solved. The excess membrane area generated by electroporation manifests as amplitudes of the second, fourth, and sixth Legendre modes, P2(cos{\\theta}), P4(cos{\\theta}), and P6(cos{\\theta}), respectively, which serves as the shape function. The proposed model reveals that accentuated deformation in GUVs under strong pulsed DC fields arises from the additional surface area introduced by membrane poration. Thus, the resulting GUV deformation, obtained as a result of a balance of electric stresses and the membrane and hydrodynamic stresses, is prolate or oblate cylindrical or square shaped instead of prolate or oblate ellipsoids, as otherwise seen under weak AC/DC fields. The origin of higher modes is essentially due to electropore-generated membrane conductance, which is approximated to angularly vary as 2/3(1/2+P2(cos{\\theta})), to keep the calculations analytically tractable, whereby the electric potential varies as P3(cos{\\theta}) in addition to P1(cos{\\theta}) seen for unporated vesicles. The vesicle correspondingly admits P4(cos{\\theta}) and P6(cos{\\theta}) shape deformation modes, besides P2(cos{\\theta}) observed for unporated vesicles, on account of the quadratic dependence of Maxwell stresses on the electric field. The model qualitatively and semiquantitatively, with a correction factor (fitting parameter), captures the square shape modes for \\b{eta} = 1, prolate ellipsoids (cylinders) for \\b{eta} >1, and oblate cylinders for \\b{eta} < 1, where \\b{eta} ={\\sigma}i/{\\sigma}e is the ratio of the electrical conductivity of the inner fluid ({\\sigma}i) to the outer fluid ({\\sigma}e).","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12016","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.036051","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsbio-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Rochish M.

Following the frameworks of standpoint theory, Schlossberg's transition theory, and domains of power, we focused our analysis on how these women initially developed an interest in physics before coming to college and how important transition points in college impacted their physics self-efficacy and sense of belonging. We find that the transitions from high school to college introductory courses and then into the physics major were bottlenecks at which women faced new challenges. Our findings suggest that although women develop initial fascinations with physics in a myriad of unique and interesting ways, they tend to follow a similar trajectory that harms their physics self-efficacy and sense of belonging over time. Finally, although we focused on women who had persisted in pursuing a physics degree thus far, their accounts point to an unsupportive physics culture that could drive other women and students from marginalized demographic groups out of the discipline.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12024","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.036448","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsed-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Sarah Lindley (University of Pittsburgh), Chandralekha Singh (University of Pittsburgh)","raw_content_length":1266,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type","Schlossberg"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1265,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a physicist","Major educational transition points","womens physics self","arXiv251012024v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","this investigation","individual interviews","six female undergraduate physics majors","a large public research university","the US"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["a large public research university"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a physicist":2.0,"Major educational transition points":2.0,"womens physics self":2.0,"arXiv251012024v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"this investigation":1.0,"individual interviews":1.0,"six female undergraduate physics majors":1.0,"a large public research university":1.0,"the US":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7513616763888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7582,"joy":0.0332,"surprise":0.1664,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0188,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the experiences of women in physics, highlighting challenges they face.

Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12055","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.037299","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsapp-ph","hep-ex","research","cond-matmtrl-sci","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Yonggang Hu, Yiqing Liao, Lufeng Yang, Ke Zhang, Yufan Peng, Shijun Tang, Shengxiang Wang, Meifang Ding, Jiahao Wu, Jianrong Lin, Jinding Liang, Yimin Wei, Yanting Jin, Zhengliang Gong, Anatoliy Senyshyn, Jie Chen, Yong Yang","raw_content_length":1967,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1966,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantification","Electrolyte Degradation","Lithium","arXiv251012055v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Non-destructive characterization","lithium-ion batteries","critical insights","performance","lifespan"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantification":2.0,"Electrolyte Degradation":2.0,"Lithium":2.0,"arXiv251012055v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Non-destructive characterization":1.0,"lithium-ion batteries":1.0,"critical insights":1.0,"performance":1.0,"lifespan":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7514018547222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.36,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7897,"joy":0.0222,"surprise":0.026,"sadness":0.0159,"fear":0.0277,"anger":0.0542,"disgust":0.0643},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a non-destructive method to quantify electrolyte degradation in lithium-ion batteries, providing insights into battery lifespan and performance.

Conventional methods for enhancing spectral complexity typically rely on cascading discrete photonic components, resulting in a complexity that scales only linearly with the number of components. Here, we introduce hyper-spectral photonic integrated circuits (HS-PICs), in which spectral complexity scales exponentially with the number of components. This is achieved through recursive inverse design - a system-level inverse design strategy that exploits intricate inter-component interactions as design freedoms, thereby substantially expanding the design space for spectral engineering. Using this approach, we demonstrate that even a single waveguide structure can resolve spectra with sub-picometer resolution, surpassing the performance of current state-of-the-art spectrometers. This performance bridges optical and microwave frequencies in spectral analysis, enabling simultaneous monitoring of optical and radio signals within a single device.

The zonal flow is driven by an imposed forcing in a thin layer near the surface. A meridional circulation is set up, analogous to the Ferrel-like cells observed in Jupiter's atmosphere. Acting on a stably stratified thin surface layer, the meridional flow induces a horizontal temperature anomaly which leads to a gradual reduction of the zonal winds with depth, governed by the thermal wind equation. Our model is a Boussinesq plane layer, with gravity acting parallel to the rotation axis. A suite of fully three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations has been performed to investigate the model behaviour. Below the forced stable layer, convection is occurring, typically in the form of tall thin cells. The fluctuating components of the three-dimensional flow can be driven by either the convection or the Reynolds stresses associated with the jet shear flow. When fluctuations are mainly driven by convection in the form of tall thin columns and the forcing is relatively weak, the horizontal temperature anomaly persists much deeper into the interior than when it is driven by shear flow. The zonal jets can therefore extend deep into the interior, consistent with the Juno gravity data.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12236","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.039789","language":"en","tags":["preprints","astro-phep","research","physicsflu-dyn","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Laura K.

Evidence from Tokyo metropolitan Commutes","content":"arXiv:2510.12381v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in data collection and technology enable a deeper understanding of complex urban commuting, yet few studies have rigorously analyzed the temporal stability and Origin-Destination (OD) heterogeneity of route choice. To address this, we analyze one year of smartphone position data from over one million users in the Tokyo metropolitan area to extract high-resolution commuting trajectories. Our methodology is twofold: First, we develop algorithms to process raw position data, accurately extracting the commuting trajectory, transportation mode, and transfer stations. Second, by reinterpreting the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model through the canonical ensemble framework of statistical physics, we model route choice rationality as a temperature-dependent system. Our approach uniquely measures behavioral consistency in terms of rationality and preference stability over time, and distinguishes systematic from random heterogeneity. Our results reveal temporal stability in aggregate route choice behavior across the entire urban region throughout 2023.

On average across countries, the share of urban residents living in cities with over one million people rose from 18\\% in 1975 to 39\\% in 2025. Will this trend towards greater concentration in large cities continue or level off? We introduce two new city population datasets that use consistent city definitions across countries and over time. The first covers the world between 1975 and 2025, using satellite imagery. The second covers the U.S. between 1850 and 2020, using census microdata. We find that urban growth follows a consistent life cycle. Early in urbanization, large cities grow faster than smaller ones. As urban systems mature, this growth advantage fades, and cities of all sizes grow at similar rates. We use this life cycle to project future concentration in large cities. Our projections suggest that over the next 50 years, concentration will increase at less than half the rate observed in the past 50 years.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12417","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.041023","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicssoc-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Andrea Musso, Diego Rybski, Dirk Helbing, Frank Neffke","raw_content_length":1071,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["U.S."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1070,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Large cities","their growth edge","urban systems","large cities","countries","arXiv251012417v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","urban populations","the share","urban residents"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Large cities":2.0,"their growth edge":2.0,"urban systems":2.0,"large cities":2.0,"countries":2.0,"arXiv251012417v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"urban populations":1.0,"the share":1.0,"urban residents":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751529243333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8629,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0991,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.0071,"anger":0.0118,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes urban growth patterns using satellite imagery and census data, projecting a slowdown in concentration in large cities.

However, the generation of high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequencies remains a challenge for existing techniques. Here, a technique by combining the multi-laser pulses frequency beating and coherent undulator amplification is proposed for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequency. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed technique can produce multi-color THz radiation with three to six distinguished colors and a peak power up to hundreds of MW, and the temporally separated two-color pulses can also be produced by employing undulators with different resonance. Due to the intrinsic properties of the proposed technique, the THz frequencies, the color number and the frequency interval can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the beating laser. This method paves the way for advanced application of THz pump-THz probe experiments for selective excitation of atomic multi-level systems and molecular fingerprint recognition.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12426","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.041824","language":"en","tags":["physicsacc-ph","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Yin Kang, Weiyi Yin, Xianzhe Li, Yixuan Liu, Yue Wang, Yuan Ma, Kaiqing Zhang, Chao Feng","raw_content_length":1264,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tunable Multi arXiv:2510.12426v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1263,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Intense and Tunable Multi","arXiv251012426v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","High-power multi-color terahertz THz radiation","extraordinary scientific application prospects","various scientific frontiers","its capacity","THz excitation","multiple frequencies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Intense and Tunable Multi":2.0,"arXiv251012426v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"High-power multi-color terahertz THz radiation":1.0,"extraordinary scientific application prospects":1.0,"various scientific frontiers":1.0,"its capacity":1.0,"THz excitation":1.0,"multiple frequencies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7515565494444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8247,"joy":0.041,"surprise":0.0858,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0092,"anger":0.0251,"disgust":0.0091},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a new technique for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation.

We compare the different models implemented in the codes and show that the gyrokinetic equations without collisions inherently contain the ideal MHD limit. The simulation results show that the stability of the internal kink mode strongly depends on the choice of several setup parameters like the inclusion of parallel magnetic field fluctuations, the tokamak aspect ratio, the drift- or gyrokinetic treatment of the ions and the electron mass. Furthermore, we demonstrate the stabilization of the instabilities by diamagnetic effects.

A finite difference reactor model was developed to simulate the cyclic adsorption, purge, and hydrogenation stages. The model incorporates experimentally-derived rate expressions, accounts for system delay via a second-order response function, and was fitted to time-resolved concentration laboratory data using Bayesian optimisation. A combined parameter estimation strategy was employed to ensure mass continuity across stages and improve the robustness of purge kinetics. The kinetic parameters extracted reveal that carbonate decomposition, not methanation, is the rate-limiting step during hydrogenation. Temperature-dependent simulations confirm a trade-off between reaction kinetics and CO2 storage capacity, with methane yield maximised at 300C when compared with the other temperature sets.

Here, we combine Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy (ec-TEM) with Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to monitor CEI evolution in a realistic electrochemical environment, focusing on electrolyte behavior under high voltages. The correlation between the electrochemical response, gas and liquid analysis after cycling, and the observation of deposited species on the working electrode (WE) reveals the processes governing CEI formation, stability, and composition. Cycling between 4 and 6 V vs Li leads to dispersed particles instead of a continuous film. These are partly composed of LiF and an amorphous phase that prevents dissolution at high potential. When cycled between 2.5 and 5.5 V, an anodic current peak indicates the formation of a 36 nm amorphous thin film without crystalline LiF, attributed to EC oxidation producing HF and subsequent LiF at a higher potential. LiF dissolution appears to follow a two-step pathway: electrolyte oxidation forms soluble intermediates, which are later reduced at lower potential to yield species capable of dissolving LiF. These results provide new insights into CEI formation and dissolution mechanisms, underscoring the need for further studies across different potential windows and with non carbonate electrolytes to validate these findings.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12467","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.043829","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicschem-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Kevyn Gallegos-Moncayo, Josephine Rezkallah, Justine Jean, Arash Jamali, Gr\\'egory Gachot, Arnaud Demorti\\`ere","raw_content_length":1503,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy","ec-TEM","CEI evolution","Coupling Liquid Electrochemical TEM","GC/MS","CEI","GC/MS arXiv:2510.12467v1 Announce Type","LiF"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1502,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["GCMS","Investigation","Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation","Coupling Liquid Electrochemical TEM","arXiv251012467v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A deeper understanding","CEI","elucidate battery degradation","Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"GCMS":3.0,"Investigation":2.0,"Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation":2.0,"Coupling Liquid Electrochemical TEM":2.0,"arXiv251012467v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A deeper understanding":1.0,"CEI":1.0,"elucidate battery degradation":1.0,"Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7516276347222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3665000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5267,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8848,"joy":0.0161,"surprise":0.0366,"sadness":0.0109,"fear":0.0198,"anger":0.0175,"disgust":0.0143},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the CEI formation in batteries, which is crucial for improving battery performance and lifespan.

In this work, we develop an analysis of a local inversion symmetry broken fluid flow model through an undulating microchannel. Surface undulations of a few tens of Hertz in a soft microchannel keep the fluid flow in a low Reynolds number regime, allowing the advantage of a perturbation analysis of fluid flow. Using this, we develop a detailed analysis of the relationship between the fluid velocity and surface undulations, which is crucial for the subsequent numerical analysis of tracer motion. We used this information to study the dynamics of a tracer particle in the velocity field of an undulating microchannel. We show that the tracer particle can undergo ratcheting (which we call the hydrodynamics ratchet effect) in very specific, physically meaningful circumstances.

Within the framework of lubrication theory, we investigate droplet motion and the contact-line dynamics driven by a chemical step, with the contact-line singularity addressed by the Navier slip condition. For both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) droplets, two successive stages are identified: the migration stage, when the droplet traverses both regions, and the asymmetric spreading stage, when the droplet spreads on the hydrophilic region while being constrained by the border. For 2D droplets, we present a matched asymptotic analysis which agrees with numerical solutions. In the migration stage, a 2D droplet can exhibit translational motion with a constant speed. In the asymmetric spreading stage, the contact line at the droplet rear is pinned at the border. We show that a boundary layer still exists near the pinned contact line, across which the slope is approximately constant, whereas the curvature would diverge in the absence of slip. For 3D droplets, our numerical simulations show that the evolution is qualitatively analogous to the 2D case, while being significantly affected by the lateral flow. At early times, the contact line on the hydrophilic region advances linearly and spreads transversely according to a power law $t^{1/2}$. The droplet length and width exhibit non-monotonic variations due to the lateral flow. Eventually, the droplet detaches from the border and reaches equilibrium at the hydrophilic substrate.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12514","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.044672","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Zhuo Long, Peng Gao","raw_content_length":1669,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Navier"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1668,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a chemical step","Migration","a droplet","Announce Type","new Abstract","The chemical step","an elementary pattern","chemically heterogeneous substrates","two regions","different wettability"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a chemical step":3.0,"Migration":2.0,"a droplet":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The chemical step":1.0,"an elementary pattern":1.0,"chemically heterogeneous substrates":1.0,"two regions":1.0,"different wettability":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7516577758333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8738,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0375,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0171,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0424},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on droplet motion driven by chemical steps.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_4d39482769d1","title":"Trading robustness: a scenario","content":"arXiv:2510.12519v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Treatment planning in radiotherapy is inherently a multi-criteria optimization (MCO) problem. Traditionally, the treatment's robustness is not formulated as a part of this decision making problem, but dealt with separately through margins or robust optimization. This work facilitates integration of robustness into multi-criteria optimization using a recently proposed efficient scenario-free (s-f) robust optimization approach: The s-f approach relies on the fast evaluation of the expected dose distribution and mean variance during optimization. This is achieved by precomputation of probabilistic quantities, which can then be used for repeated solving of subproblems in the two explored MCO approaches: Lexicographic Ordering (LO) and Pareto Front (PF) approximation. Different prioritization strategies within the LO approach are used to assess the impact of variance reduction while a 3-objective PF approximation, including a variance reduction objective, is generated to visualize and analyze trade-offs between the competing objectives. The robust optimization is performed including 100 scenarios modeling setup and range errors, as well as organ motion, on 3D- and 4DCT lung cancer patient datasets. Robustness analysis is performed to assess and explore the efficacy of all optimization strategies. The s-f approach enabled robust optimization in MCO with computational times comparable to nominal MCO. Both MCO strategies highlighted the interplay between dosimetric and variance reduction objectives. The LO approach showed how prioritization affects plan quality and robustness, while the PF analysis revealed a clear trade-off between robustness and organ-at-risk sparing. The reported analysis highlighted the conflicting trade-off nature of plan robustness and dosimetric quality, demonstrating how robust MCO supports a more informed and flexible decision-making process in treatment planning.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12519","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.045112","language":"en","tags":["physicsmed-ph","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":266,"author":"Remo Cristoforetti, Philipp S\\\"uss, Tobias Becher, Niklas Wahl","raw_content_length":1963,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.33,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MCO","Lexicographic Ordering"],"persons":["Pareto Front"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1962,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Trading robustness","a scenario","arXiv251012519v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Treatment planning","radiotherapy","a multi-criteria optimization","MCO problem","the treatments robustness","a part"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["radiotherapy"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Trading robustness":2.0,"a scenario":2.0,"arXiv251012519v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Treatment planning":1.0,"radiotherapy":1.0,"a multi-criteria optimization":1.0,"MCO problem":1.0,"the treatments robustness":1.0,"a part":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7516730247222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.7975,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9595,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9018,"joy":0.0321,"surprise":0.0218,"sadness":0.0027,"fear":0.0139,"anger":0.0161,"disgust":0.0117},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to radiotherapy treatment planning by integrating robustness into multi-criteria optimization.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_a7013ef653d8","title":"Origin of pressure-flow non","content":"arXiv:2510.12588v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This study presents a first-principles model to predict the two-phase pressure drop in gas-liquid intermittent flow through round capillaries, which serve as the simplest analogous of a porous medium. Building upon the classical capillary flow theory, we derive a model for a train of elongated bubbles, and rigorously quantify its validity in terms of the dimensionless parameters of the problem (capillary number, number of bubbles, gas volume fraction, and channel length-to-diameter ratio). The total two-phase pressure drop is found to be non-linear with respect to the mean liquid slug velocity, varying in discrete steps due to its explicit dependence on the number of bubbles, and also influenced by the motion of both phases. Moreover, formulating the model in dimensionless terms reveals key scaling laws that govern the two-phase flow rheology. Perturbation theory shows that a single bubble induces an excess pressure drop in a liquid-filled slender channel, enabling the introduction of a pressure-dependent effective viscosity to describe the system. Finally, our analytical framework is extended from a single capillary to a bundle of cylindrical tubes. In nearly homogeneous bundles, inviscid bubble trains exhibit a smooth transition from a Bretherton-like regime with an apparent flow exponent of 2/3 at low pressure drops to weaker sub-linear regimes (with exponents between 2/3 and 1) as the pressure drop increases. Introducing the smallest pores disrupts the monotonic scaling of the flow exponent, reflecting a more complex rheological response. Deviations in two-phase flow behavior from the Darcy law are examined across the model parameter space and in relation to geometrical heterogeneity, offering new insights into pore-scale multiphase transport.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12588","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.046368","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Paolo Botticini, Davide Picchi, Santanu Sinha, Alex Hansen","raw_content_length":1826,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1825,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Origin","pressure-flow non","arXiv251012588v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This study","a first-principles model","the two-phase pressure drop","gas-liquid intermittent flow","round capillaries","which"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Origin":2.0,"pressure-flow non":2.0,"arXiv251012588v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"a first-principles model":1.0,"the two-phase pressure drop":1.0,"gas-liquid intermittent flow":1.0,"round capillaries":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751719557222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.4985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7003,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8585,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0272,"sadness":0.0044,"fear":0.0365,"anger":0.0385,"disgust":0.0204},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a first-principles model for two-phase pressure drop in gas-liquid intermittent flow through capillaries.

Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) based on dynamic deformations is the standard technique for imaging mechanical properties, but the viscoelastic nature of soft tissue makes the results dependent on the actuation frequency, which can be limiting. In this proof-of-principle study we propose a noise robust framework for reconstructing relative stiffness properties from quasi-static in vivo displacement fields captured on a physiological time scale. The acquisition is performed using a pneumatic pressure cuff to induce tissue deformation in a controlled manner. The reconstruction does not require boundary information which is generally hard to access in vivo nor spatial derivatives of displacement fields that are known to amplify noise. The validity of our framework is corroborated with in silico experiments on a numerical phantom. In vivo experiments on the thigh of a volunteer demonstrate the repeatability of the method. As an application, the quantitative change in muscle stiffness during isometric knee flexion is investigated which yielded physiologically meaningful results.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12609","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.046782","language":"en","tags":["physicsmed-ph","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"David G.

The basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0$ calculated from models that assume homogeneous mixing or single-layer contact structures have limited applicability to complex social systems. Here, we propose an expression of $\\mathcal R_0$ in the context of multiplex networks, enabling the analysis of disease transmission across multiple social layers. We adapt the Degree-Based Mean-Field (DBMF) SIR model for single-layered complex networks to the multiplex setting, where each layer has its own degree distribution and infection rate. Using the Next Generation Matrix method, we derive an analytical expression for the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0$. Numerical integration of the multiplex DBMF equations shows that $\\mathcal R_0 = 1$ marks the epidemic threshold and governs the functional dependence of key outbreak indicators. In addition to the exact result for the $\\mathcal R_0$, we provide an approximation denoted as $\\tau$, which is easier to compute and more straightforward to interpret in terms of the parameters of the system, and shares most of the expected properties of the basic reproduction number. Stochastic agent-based simulations confirm these results, demonstrating a direct correspondence between $\\tau$ and the average number of secondary infections in the early epidemic phase, in line with the interpretation of $\\mathcal R_0$. This research provides a robust generalization of $\\mathcal R_0$ for layered contact structures, offering a more realistic basis for epidemic forecasting and the design of intervention strategies.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12614","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.047211","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cond-matstat-mech","nlinao","research","q-biope","physicssoc-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Eric Alejandro Rozan, Mario Ignacio Simoy, Sebastian Bouzat, Marcelo Nestor Kuperman","raw_content_length":1747,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Modeling Epidemics","DBMF","Multiplex Networks","the Next Generation Matrix"],"persons":["Announce Type","Epidemic Threshold","multiplex networks"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\mathcal","$\\ma"]},"char_count":1740,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Modeling Epidemics","Multiplex Networks","Epidemic Threshold","Basic Reproduction Number","models","mathcal R_0","arXiv251012614v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Accurate epidemic forecasting","the layered and heterogeneous nature"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Modeling Epidemics":2.0,"Multiplex Networks":2.0,"Epidemic Threshold":2.0,"Basic Reproduction Number":2.0,"models":2.0,"mathcal R_0":2.0,"arXiv251012614v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Accurate epidemic forecasting":1.0,"the layered and heterogeneous nature":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7517478988888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9,"joy":0.0137,"surprise":0.0382,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.0251,"anger":0.0097,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on modeling epidemic spread using multiplex networks to improve forecasting.

While nanoscale energy transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces, particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis, a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis, that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11870","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.049989","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","cond-matmes-hall","physicschem-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Renai Chen, Galen T.

One main field-monitoring technique, the spin-precession magnetometer (SPM), observes electron, nucleus, color center, or muon spins as they precess in response to their local magnetic field. Here, we study Bayesian signal-recovery methods for SPMs in the free-induction decay (FID) mode. In particular, we study tracking of field changes well within the coherence time of the spin system, and thus well beyond the response bandwidth, as in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 040503 (2018)]. We derive the Bayesian Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound that dictates the ultimate precision in estimating the Larmor frequency, which we show to be attained by the computationally-expensive prediction error method (PEM). Relative to this benchmark, we show that the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) offer near-optimal tracking that is also computationally efficient, with the use of the latter giving better results only for large spin number. Focusing thus on the EKF, we show that it is sufficient to accurately track fluctuating and unknown transient signals. Our methods can be easily adapted to other types of sensors undergoing non-linear dissipative dynamics and experiencing intrinsic Gaussian-like stochastic noises.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11884","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.050384","language":"en","tags":["physicsins-det","preprints","physicsatom-ph","research","quant-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Klaudia Dilcher, Piotr Bania, Diana Mendez-Avalos, Aleksandra Sierant, Morgan W.

Within the field of cellular magneto-mechanical stimulation, vortex microdiscs have emerged as particularly promising candidates for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we introduce a simplified two-dimensional model describing the magneto-mechanical response of such particles embedded in viscoelastic media under varying magnetic fields. Using a Maxwell description of the medium combined with simplified elasticity assumptions, we derive analytical expressions and support them with numerical simulations of particle motion under both oscillating and rotating magnetic fields. Our results show that rotating fields typically induce oscillatory dynamics and that the transition to asynchronous motion occurs at a critical frequency determined by viscosity and stiffness. The amplitude and phase of this motion is governed by the competition between magnetic and viscoelastic contributions, with particle motion being strongly impaired when the latter dominate. Energy-based considerations further demonstrate that, within the frequency range explored of few tens of Hertz, no heat is generated -- distinguishing this approach from magnetic hyperthermia -- while the elastic energy transferred to the surrounding medium is, in principle, sufficient to perturb major cellular processes. This work provides a simple framework to anticipate the first-order influence of rheological properties on magnetically driven microdisc dynamics, thereby enabling a better understanding of their impact in cells or extracellular materials and bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical modelling.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11906","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.050823","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsbio-ph","cond-matsoft","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Andrea Vison\\`a, Robert Morel, H\\'el\\`ene Joisten, Bernard Dieny, Alice Nicolas","raw_content_length":1892,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Maxwell"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1891,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Modelling","magnetic vortex microdisc dynamics","varying magnetic field","biological viscoelastic environments","arXiv251011906v1 Announce Type","cross","Magnetically driven microparticles","a versatile platform","biological systems","the physical framework"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Modelling":2.0,"magnetic vortex microdisc dynamics":2.0,"varying magnetic field":2.0,"biological viscoelastic environments":2.0,"arXiv251011906v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Magnetically driven microparticles":1.0,"a versatile platform":1.0,"biological systems":1.0,"the physical framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7518743050000003,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.902,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3804,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7751,"joy":0.042,"surprise":0.126,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0226,"anger":0.0173,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical model and numerical simulations of magnetically driven microdiscs in viscoelastic media.

However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments -- dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines -- are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle -- which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts -- advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12142","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.053183","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsplasm-ph","physicsspace-ph","research","astro-phsr","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Srinjana Routh, Shaonwita Pal, Dibyendu Nandy, Subhamoy Chatterjee, Dipankar Banerjee, Mohd.

Here, we employ \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics under controlled electrode potentials to model a realistic stepped Pt--water interface incorporating experimentally observed (111)$\\times$(111) and (111)$\\times$(100) edge motifs. This allows us to resolve, for the first time, the site-specific structure, charge distribution, and electrostatics of the electric double layer at a nanostructured Pt surface. We find that differential capacitance near the potential of zero charge (PZC) arises almost entirely from potential-dependent chemisorption of water on flat (111) terraces. In contrast, step edges are saturated with chemisorbed water even below the PZC and thus do not contribute to the capacitance. Instead, edges accumulate excess positive charge and exhibit a locally elevated electrostatic potential, as revealed by spatially resolved macroscopic potential profiles. This electrostatic asymmetry implies a greater barrier for electron accumulation at step sites compared to terraces, consistent with enhanced charge localisation and reactivity. Finally, the higher-in-energy d-band centre and sharper projected density of states at edge atoms further support their role as active, positively charged centres. Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed experimental shift of the PZC with step density and establish a predictive framework for understanding and optimising interfacial charging in nanostructured Pt electrocatalysts.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12176","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.053606","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicschem-ph","cond-matmtrl-sci","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Matthew T.

Lack of convergence constrains the estimation of free energies, rates, and mechanisms of complex molecular events. Here, we introduce the \"Randomized ITErative trajectory reWeighting\" (RiteWeight) algorithm to estimate a stationary distribution from unconverged simulation data. This method iteratively reweights trajectory segments in a self-consistent way by solving for the stationary distribution of a Markov state model (MSM), updating segment weights, and employing a new random clustering in each iteration. The iterative random clustering mitigates the phase-space discretization error inherent in existing trajectory reweighting techniques and yields quasi-continuous configuration-space distributions. We present mathematical analysis of the algorithm's fixed points as well as empirical validation using both synthetic MD Trp-cage trajectories, for which the stationary solution is exactly calculable, and standard atomistic MD Trp-cage trajectories extracted from a long reference simulation.

Seismological observations initially provided evidence for differential/super-rotation of the inner core, but recently demonstrated a possibly about 70-year periodic oscillation. The contrasting results underscore the ongoing enigma surrounding inner core motion, leaving debates unresolved, including the precise oscillate period. In parallel to seismic observations, satellite geodesy has accumulated decades of global high-precision records, providing a novel avenue to probe inner core motions. Here, we detect an about 6-year oscillation from the gravitational field degree-2 order-2 Stokes coefficients derived from satellite observations, and find it has a unique phase correlation with the about 6-year signal in the Earth's length-of-day variations. This correlation is attributed to an inner core oscillation which is controlled by the gravitational coupling between the inner core and lower mantle (mainly due to the density heterogeneity of the two large low-velocity provinces; LLVPs). That is, we independently corroborate the inner core periodic oscillation, albeit with a significantly shorter period than previously suggested. Our findings demonstrate the dense layer of the LLVPs (mean density anomalies of about +0.9 percent at the bottom), consistent with inversions from tidal tomography and Stoneley modes. Furthermore, our research reveals equatorial topographic undulations of about 187 m at the inner core boundary.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09417","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.059217","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsgeo-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Yachong An, Hao Ding, Fred D.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_51b85e0e7a51","title":"Lagrangian filtering for wave","content":"arXiv:2406.03477v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Geophysical flows are typically composed of wave and mean motions with a wide range of overlapping temporal scales, making separation between the two types of motion in wave-resolving numerical simulations challenging. Lagrangian filtering - whereby a temporal filter is applied in the frame of the flow - is an effective way to overcome this challenge, allowing clean separation of waves from mean flow based on frequency separation in a Lagrangian frame. Previous implementations of Lagrangian filtering have used particle tracking approaches, which are subject to large memory requirements or difficulties with particle clustering. Kafiabad and Vanneste (2023, KV23) recently proposed a novel method for finding Lagrangian means without particle tracking by solving a set of partial differential equations alongside the governing equations of the flow. In this work, we adapt the approach of KV23 to develop a flexible, on-the-fly, PDE-based method for Lagrangian filtering using arbitrary convolutional filters. We present several different wave-mean decompositions, demonstrating that our Lagrangian methods are capable of recovering a clean wave-field from a nonlinear simulation of geostrophic turbulence interacting with Poincar\\'e waves.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03477","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.059635","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Lois E.

Due to its unquenchable nature, measurements by static compression techniques on physical properties of davemaoite at lower mantle conditions are rare and technically challenging, and those are essential to constrain compositions and properties of mineralogical models in the lower mantle. Here, we present Hugoniot equation of state and sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass under shock compression. The CaSiO3 glass transforms into the crystalline phase above 34 GPa and completely transforms into davemaoite above 120 GPa. Thermal equation of state and Hugoniot temperature of davemaoite have been derived from the shock wave data. The CaSiO3 glass under shcok compression has very high shock temperature. Shock wave experiments for sound velocity of CaSiO3 glass indicate that no melting is observed at Hugoniot pressure up to 117.6 GPa.

These are key quantities in rapidly developing optics research and in technologies focusing on light induced forces and torques on materials. Spin angular momentum (SAM) density is of particular interest, since unlike orbital angular momentum, it is uncoupled from linear momentum. The SAM density of light was first estimated in 1909 by Poynting, using a mechanical analogy. Exact expressions, based on results from quantum mechanics and field theory were subsequently developed, and are in common use today. In this paper, we show that the SAM density of light can be obtained directly from the Coulomb force and Maxwell's equations, without reliance on quantum mechanics or field theories; it could have been calculated by Maxwell and his contemporaries. Besides its historical significance, the simple derivation of our result makes it readily accessible to non-experts in the field.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05565","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.060877","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":151,"author":"Xiaoyu Zheng, Peter Palffy-Muhoray","raw_content_length":1006,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.755,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SAM","Maxwell","linear"],"persons":["arXiv:2501.05565v2 Announce"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1005,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["light","the spin angular momentum density","arXiv250105565v2 Announce Type","Abstract","addition","energy","linear and angular momentum","These","key quantities","optics research"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["energy"],"renewable_energy":["energy"],"research_academic":["optics research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"light":4.0,"the spin angular momentum density":2.0,"arXiv250105565v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"addition":1.0,"energy":1.0,"linear and angular momentum":1.0,"These":1.0,"key quantities":1.0,"optics research":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7522250591666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6249,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8135,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.0286,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0686,"anger":0.0458,"disgust":0.0212},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new derivation of spin angular momentum density of light, potentially simplifying its understanding and accessibility.

However, conventional FWI methods suffer from issues related to computational efficiency, dependence on initial models, and the inability to quantify uncertainty. This study aims to enhance inversion performance and provide a reliable method for uncertainty quantification in medical FWI imaging. This study integrates the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm into the FWI framework by deriving the posterior gradient for probabilistic inversion. To evaluate the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets, including a breast tissue model with realistic anatomical structure. Imaging accuracy and uncertainty quantification are assessed to compare the performance of SVGD-based FWI with conventional FWI and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) methods. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is implemented as a benchmark to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates. For synthetic data, the SVGD-based FWI framework yields more precise estimates in the region of interest (ROI) and demonstrates faster convergence compared to the conventional FWI. For the anatomically realistic breast tissue simulation, SVGD produces a maximum relative error of 1.10\\% and a mean relative error of 0.09\\% in the ROI. The estimated uncertainty is spatially consistent, with most values below 0.01 and a mean of approximately 0.003. Compared to SVI, SVGD provides improved structural resolution and stronger agreement with the MCMC benchmark, indicating more reliable uncertainty quantification. The SVGD-based FWI method improves inversion quality, enhances uncertainty quantification. These findings indicate that probabilistic inversion is a promising tool for addressing the limitations of traditional FWI methods in ultrasonic imaging of medical tissues.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07348","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.061313","language":"en","tags":["physicsmed-ph","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":265,"author":"Qiang Li, Heyu Ma, Chengcheng Liu, Dean Ta","raw_content_length":1959,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.325,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SVGD","Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging Using Probabilistic Inversion: Leveraging Variational Inference for Speed Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification arXiv:2501.07348v3","the Stein Variational Gradient Descent","FWI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1958,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging","Probabilistic Inversion","Variational Inference","Speed Reconstruction","Uncertainty Quantification","This study","Announce Type","Abstract","Full Waveform Inversion","FWI"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Uncertainty Quantification"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging":2.0,"Probabilistic Inversion":2.0,"Variational Inference":2.0,"Speed Reconstruction":2.0,"Uncertainty Quantification":2.0,"This study":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Full Waveform Inversion":1.0,"FWI":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752239522777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.4985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7003,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7518,"joy":0.0194,"surprise":0.0163,"sadness":0.042,"fear":0.1274,"anger":0.0158,"disgust":0.0273},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for medical imaging using ultrasound.

This places higher demands on the timing performance of all aspects of PET systems. One effective approach is to use microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs) for prompt Cherenkov photon detection. In this study, we developed a dual-module Cherenkov PET imaging experimental platform, utilising our proprietary 8 * 8-anode Cherenkov radiator-integrated window MCP-PMTs in combination with custom-designed multi-channel electronics, and designed a specific calibration and correction method for the platform. Using this platform, a CTR of 103 ps FWHM was achieved.

The low-order spatial and temporal moments contain limited information about the eddy diffusivity but are often sufficient for quantification and modeling of nonlocal and anisotropic effects. However, when using MFM to compute eddy diffusivity moments, the statistical convergence can be slow for higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that using the same direct numerical simulation (DNS) for all forced MFM simulations improves statistical convergence of the eddy diffusivity moments. We present its implementation in conjunction with a decomposition method that handles the MFM forcing semi-analytically and allows for consistent boundary condition treatment, which we develop for both scalar and momentum transport. We demonstrate that for a two-dimensional Rayleigh--Taylor instability case study, using the same DNS for all forced MFM simulations results in convergence with O(100) simulations rather than O(1000) simulations. We then demonstrate the impacts of improved convergence on the quantification of the eddy diffusivity.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06418","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.063353","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Dana Lynn Ona-Lansigan Lavacot, Jessie Liu, Brandon E.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_156495ed71e4","title":"Impact of Oxygen on DNA Damage Distribution in 3D Genome and Its Correlation to Oxygen Enhancement Ratio under High LET Irradiation","content":"arXiv:2503.21837v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The variation of the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) across Linear Energy Transfer (LET) currently lacks a comprehensive mechanistic interpretation and a mechanistic model. Our earlier research revealed a significant correlation between the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) within 3D genome and radiation-induced cell death, which offers valuable insights into the oxygen effect. We propose a model where the reaction of oxygen is represented as the probability of inducing DNA strand breaks. Then it is integrated into a track-structure Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the impact of oxygen on the distribution of DSBs within 3D genome. Using the parameters from our previous study, we calculate the OER values related to cell survival. Results show that the incidence ratios of clustered DSBs in a single topologically associating domain (TAD) (case 2) and DSBs in frequently-interacting TADs (case 3) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions align with the trend of the OER of cell survival across LET. Our OER curves exhibit good correspondence with experimental data. This study provides a potentially mechanistic explanation for changes in OER across LET. High-LET irradiation leads to dense ionization events, resulting in an overabundance of lesions that readily induce case 2 and case 3, which have substantially higher probabilities of cell killing than other damage patterns. This may contribute to the main mechanism governing the variation of OER for high LET. Our study further underscores the importance of the DSB distribution within 3D genome in the context of radiation-induced cell death.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21837","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.063800","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsbio-ph","research","physicsmed-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Ankang Hu, Wanyi Zhou, Xiyu Luo, Rui Qiu, Junli Li","raw_content_length":1671,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Linear Energy Transfer","OER","3D Genome"],"persons":["Monte Carlo","Oxygen","arXiv:2503.21837v2 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1670,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Impact","Oxygen","DNA Damage Distribution","3D Genome","Its Correlation","Oxygen Enhancement Ratio","High","Irradiation","arXiv250321837v2 Announce Type","Abstract"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Impact":2.0,"Oxygen":2.0,"DNA Damage Distribution":2.0,"3D Genome":2.0,"Its Correlation":2.0,"Oxygen Enhancement Ratio":2.0,"High":2.0,"Irradiation":2.0,"arXiv250321837v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752331118888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5506,"joy":0.0138,"surprise":0.112,"sadness":0.0418,"fear":0.0986,"anger":0.1056,"disgust":0.0777},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a mechanistic model for understanding the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) in radiation-induced cell death, focusing on the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_68359631270e","title":"Improving the robustness of the immersed interface method through regularized velocity reconstruction","content":"arXiv:2504.03929v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI involving complex geometries. The ability of the method to sharply resolve stress discontinuities induced by singular immersed boundary forces in the presence of low-regularity geometrical representations makes it a compelling choice for three-dimensional modeling of complex geometries in diverse engineering applications. Although the IIM we previously introduced offers many desirable advantages, it also imposes a restrictive mesh factor ratio, requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure stability. This is because when the mesh factor ratio constraint is not satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs, particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic conditions, offering a robust and practical solution.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03929","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:28.064222","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicscomp-ph","physicsflu-dyn","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Qi Sun, Ebrahim M.
