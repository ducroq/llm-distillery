A pathological hallmark of type II diabetes is the self-assembly of IAPP into {beta}-sheet rich amyloid fibers, which is associated with {beta}-cell impairment. Previously, we showed that a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) construct, consisting of a hydrophobic signal sequence coupled to a polycationic nuclear localization signal (NLS)-like sequence, exhibited potent anti-prion activity and antagonism of Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptide aggregation and neurotoxicity. Here, we have extended this approach towards type II diabetes by assessing the efficacy of the CPP construct, designated as NCAM1-PrP, in inhibiting IAPP oligomerization, fiber formation and associated cytotoxicity. Using complementary in vitro and in silico experiments, we show that NCAM1-PrP effectively modulates IAPP's toxic structures into non-toxic conformations. This study underlines the potential of our designed CPP-based therapeutic approach as a versatile tool in the battle against amyloid-associated pathologies.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681467v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.768903","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Oh, Y., Loganathan, P., Howarth, M., Maity, D., Mustafa, M., Kumar, S., Hamilton, A., Magzoub, M.","raw_content_length":1160,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IAPP","CPP"],"persons":["NCAM1-PrP"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1160,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Prion protein-derived cell","IAPP","a 37-residue peptide hormone","insulin","pancreatic beta-cells","A pathological hallmark","type II diabetes","the self-assembly","beta-sheet rich amyloid fibers","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["A pathological hallmark"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Prion protein-derived cell":2.0,"IAPP":2.0,"a 37-residue peptide hormone":1.0,"insulin":1.0,"pancreatic beta-cells":1.0,"A pathological hallmark":1.0,"type II diabetes":1.0,"the self-assembly":1.0,"beta-sheet rich amyloid fibers":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":25.865570170555557,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3336,"joy":0.0029,"surprise":0.0192,"sadness":0.0918,"fear":0.0509,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.4845},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes in vitro and in silico experiments showing that a CPP construct (NCAM1-PrP) can modulate IAPP's toxic structures into non-toxic conformations.

To overcome these challenges, we developed Telomere Conformation Capture by sequencing (Telomere-C), a novel high-throughput approach for the genome-wide identification of telomeric chromatin interactions. We applied Telomere-C to three normal fibroblast cell lines (BJ, IMR90, WI38), one telomerase-positive cancer cell line (HeLa S3) and two cancer cell lines (U2-OS and WI38-VA13) that maintain telomeres by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). We generated millions of telomere-associated reads per sample and identified up to 41,026 interaction peaks. We successfully validated previously-described telomeric interaction sites (e.g., TERT and DUX4), and critically, revealed a novel class of ultra-long-range interactions extending over 5 Mb away from the telomere, which surprisingly constitute over 80% of all identified contacts. Contrary to prior studies focusing on protein coding gene interactions, we discovered that the telomeric 3D interactome is overwhelmingly anchored at repetitive element hubs, particularly interstitial telomeric sequence (ITS), telomere-associated repeat 1 (TAR1) and D20S16 elements. We found that the clustering of these interactions correlates strongly with cell-type-specific telomere maintenance. Most notably, D20S16 telomeric interactions were uniquely and highly enriched in ALT cancer cells, suggesting a mechanistic link. Taken together, our study effectively constructs the first high resolution maps of the telomeric 3D interactome, redefining its scope to be dominated by ultra-long-range contacts with repetitive elements. This work provides fundamental insights into telomeric nuclear organization and establishes the telomeric D20S16 interaction as a molecular signature for the ALT pathway.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681516v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.769202","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":277,"author":"Chen, Y.-A., Mbegbu, O., Fukushima, N.

Here, we present a high-quality de novo genome assembly of Drosophila melanogaster ovarian somatic cells (OSCs), a widely used cell line that recapitulates nuclear piRNA biology. The OSC genome differs substantially from the reference genome, with major differences in transposon content and piRNA cluster composition. Our assembly resolves the 700 kb flamenco locus, the primary piRNA cluster in OSCs, and provides a genome-wide transposon map. Using this resource, we characterize piRNA source loci, reveal how piRNA cluster composition determines transposon-derived piRNA profiles, and clarify the widespread impact of the nuclear piRNA pathway on heterochromatin.

Using comparative genomics and sequence-structure analyses, we comprehensively map the phyletic distribution and domain-level functional annotations of BREX proteins across all subtypes. Our analysis uncovers numerous previously uncharacterized domains with key functional implications and demonstrates that BrxA- and BrxB-like homologs are universally present across all subtypes, thereby redefining the core machinery of BREX. Our survey strikingly expands the BREX landscape by characterizing three newly defined RM-like systems, which we term BREX-related (BR) systems, and establishes them as new subtypes that share multiple core components with BREX. Furthermore, we identified a novel composite anti-invader system that intriguingly integrates the BREX machinery with components derived from HerA/FtsK-based capture and Dpd defense systems, forming a unique multifaceted defense machinery. Notably, we identify an extensive repertoire of auxiliary effectors recruited alongside the primary effectors across all BREX and BR systems, functioning to reinforce initial restriction responses and counter phage anti-defense mechanisms. Based on these findings, we propose a unified model organized around a multi-modal sensing-modifying-restricting functional architecture, defining the fundamental basis of the multi-layered BREX defense systems.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681413v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.769730","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Rakesh, S., Krishnan, A.","raw_content_length":1569,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BrxA-","BREX"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1569,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Landscape","BREX Diversity","Multi","extensive scrutiny","BREX systems","several overarching questions","the functional modalities","individual components","the collective mechanistic framework","their defense responses"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Landscape":2.0,"BREX Diversity":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"extensive scrutiny":1.0,"BREX systems":1.0,"several overarching questions":1.0,"the functional modalities":1.0,"individual components":1.0,"the collective mechanistic framework":1.0,"their defense responses":1.0}},"age_hours":25.865613681666666,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8706,"joy":0.0035,"surprise":0.0378,"sadness":0.0105,"fear":0.0233,"anger":0.028,"disgust":0.0264},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on fundamental research into BREX systems, which are bacterial defense mechanisms.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_a08a03422ac0","title":"Hybrids reveal accessible chromatin trans genetic associations","content":"Crosses between genetically distant Zea mays (Maize) inbreds cause hybrid vigour (heterosis): an over-dominant increase in vegetative growth and grain yield. Although the contributing loci are unknown, heterosis strength varies polygenically, with crosses between stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk lineages often producing the highly heterotic F1 seed used for agriculture. As F1 genomes conserve the parental cis-regulatory state, F1 trans-interactions between haplotypes underpin F1 trait over-dominance and heterotic gene expression. Gene expression relies upon transcription factors binding cis-regulatory elements in accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) and recruiting RNA POLYMERASE II. Here, assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) examined cis-regulatory element chromatin accessibility inheritance in three different F1 parent-offspring pairs, including a representative stiff stalk-by-non-stiff stalk (B73xOh43) cross. Using concatenated reference alignment, we categorized ACR modes of inheritance (additive, dominant, under/over-dominant), revealing that ACRs are largely inherited additively, and, concordantly, that chromatin accessibility has strong narrow-sense heritability. However, mirroring other heterotic phenotypes, the B73xOh43 cross exhibited the most dominant and over-dominant inheritance. Comparing allele-specific parent-to-offspring chromatin accessibility, we identified F1 differentially trans-regulated ACRs. Using a matched chromatin accessible diversity panel, we found B73xOh43 SNPs with more ACR trans-associations than expected due to chance. These trans-regulatory variants revealed how cell-division and anabolism are elevated in heterotic F1 seedlings. This multiple discovery filtering (MDF) approach to trans-regulatory variant detection is genomic modality agnostic and stands to empower trans-relationship dissection in diverse genetic models.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681407v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.770131","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Minow, M.

Here we assessed the performance of two popular SMC based algorithms (PSMC and SMC++) in retrieving the inverse instantaneous coalescent rate (IICR) simulated under two structured equilibrium scenarios, namely the finite island (FIM) and the two-dimensional stepping-stone (2D-SST). Looking backward in time, the IICR of a couple of lineages collected in a deme is characterized by a short period of constant value (the scattering phase) followed by an increase over time (the transition phase) up to a plateau (the collecting phase). Both algorithms recovered the IICR at the collecting phase but significantly deviated from the values expected during the transition phase under specific parameters combination. Specifically, the total error increased with the number of demes and the abruptness of the transition phase, which in turn is related to the extent of between demes connectivity. Moreover, each algorithm displayed a specific bias, corresponding backward in time to an artificial expansion either at the beginning of the collecting phase (PSMC) or of the transition phase (SMC++). Our results demonstrate that the observed systematic biases carry information about metapopulation dynamics, rather than being simple artefacts. Moreover, combining the results obtained from the two algorithms will increase our understanding of the historical demography of the metapopulations and help to put forward specific evolutionary scenarios to be tested with model-based algorithms using SFS or LD statistics.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681379v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.770428","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Nieto, A., Lao, O., Mona, S.","raw_content_length":1729,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Sequential Markovian Coalescence Methods","PSMC","SMC","IICR","FIM"],"persons":[],"locations":["SMC++"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1729,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Performance","Sequential Markovian","Coalescence Methods","Populations","Markovian Coalescent SMC methods","demographic histories","genomic data","their accuracy","the presence","population structure"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Performance":2.0,"Sequential Markovian":2.0,"Coalescence Methods":2.0,"Populations":2.0,"Markovian Coalescent SMC methods":1.0,"demographic histories":1.0,"genomic data":1.0,"their accuracy":1.0,"the presence":1.0,"population structure":1.0}},"age_hours":25.865643915555555,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9012,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0297,"sadness":0.0113,"fear":0.0052,"anger":0.0249,"disgust":0.0223},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the accuracy of demographic history reconstruction methods using genomic data.

Through combined analyses of community composition and genome evolution, we quantified the temporal changes in species abundances and the evolutionary trajectories of individual community members. The extended duration of the experiment enabled the detection of adaptive mutations and community state shifts that occur only over long evolutionary timescales. We show that community dynamics are environment dependent and reproducible across replicates, and that evolution of streptomycin resistance in a previously streptomycin-sensitive species on its own can induce abrupt community state shifts. Our results provide a direct demonstration of eco-evolutionary feedbacks within a multi-species community, revealing how a single adaptive mutation can reorganize complex ecological networks.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.680894v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.770706","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Kivikoski, M., Cairns, J., Hogle, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_e63cc056c80f","title":"A novel post","content":"Multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp), are a public health emergency. The predominant CRKp sequence type worldwide is ST258. However, the factors underlying ST258's epidemic success are not well defined. The understudied two-component system CrrAB is a genomic feature of ST258 and has been hypothesized to contribute to its global dominance. Despite this, the molecular details underpinning CrrAB's contribution to ST258 pathogenicity are not well understood. We used RNA-sequencing to identify the regulon of CrrA and found that CrrAB induces the expression of a novel gene, encoding Crr-regulated fimbriae modifying protein (CfmP). CfmP post-translationally modifies fimbriae to significantly increase host cell adhesion and high bacterial loads within the host, consequently increasing ST258 virulence. CrrAB also drives high antibiotic resistance in CRKp. Thus, our data places CrrAB at the intersection of virulence and antibiotic resistance supporting its function as an important regulatory system driving the pathogenicity of ST258.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.03.680091v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.770982","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Dobihal, G.

Although this mutation led to reduction in amyloid {beta}-protein (A{beta}) production, its effect on tau pathology is not well studied. We have crossed line 66 (L66) tau transgenic mice that overexpress the P301S aggregation-prone form of tau with C57Bl6/J mice expressing a single point mutation edited into the murine APP gene via CRISPR-Cas gene editing, termed APPA673T. We have performed ELISA, histopathological and behavioural analyses of heterozygous male/female L66 and L66xAPPA673T crosses at the age of 6 months to investigate the effect of the A673T mutation on tau brain pathology and behavioural deficits in these mice. Using immunohistochemistry, we found only a moderate, yet significant, reduction of mAb 7/51-reactive tau in prefrontal cortex for L66xAPPA673T compared to L66 mice. Quantification of tau in soluble/insoluble brain homogenate fractions by ELISA confirmed the lack of overt differences between genotypes, as did our extensive behavioural phenotyping using six different paradigms accessing motor function, olfaction, depression/apathy-like behaviour, as well as exploration and sociability. Therefore, the APPA673T mutation does not appear to modulate tau pathology or motor and neuropsychiatric behaviour in L66 tau transgenic mice.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681356v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T01:46:10.771268","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Anschuetz, A., Robinson, L., Mondesir, M., Melis, V., Platt, B., Harrington, C.

{"id":"community_social_hacker_news_9543ced0a6b8","title":"Show HN: Lights Out: my 2D Rubik's Cube","content":"\"Lights Out\" is a mathematical puzzle that lives on an grid where each cell of the grid is one of two colors: either red or white. The goal is to eventually get all the cells in the grid to be red.What's the catch? Clicking a cell will not only flip its color, but also that of all cells sharing the same row or column as it.To me, this game feels like playing with a Rubik's cube --- every time you think you are fixing one cell, you mess up its neighbors!There are many ways to arrive at a solution... some mathematical (linear algebra, or combinatorics), others more logical,... and yet others which are brute force.The title “Lights Out” comes from a classic handheld game from 1997. The “rule” they follow for which-cells-get-flipped-on-click is what I call “Adjacent.” Additionally, my mathematics teacher showed me this game following another variant which I call “Same Row & Column,” but on a bigger board. He had worked out an algorithm for his version. I found the same strategy before he revealed the answer, and I feel that the process of discovering a solution is quite rewarding—it’s fundamentally related to computing on restrictive computer architectures.I implemented this app with pretty basic TypeScript. It’s been used for some experiments to discover more general of strategies for different click variants, board sizes, and even board dimensions! It has also been the basis for the corresponding video produced using the Python library manim.Try it out and let me know how you do!

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_2cf34d66d36c","title":"Politieke partijen gaven vlak voor verbod nog tienduizenden euro's uit op sociale media","content":"Wie deze week door zijn tijdlijn op Instagram of Facebook scrolt, zal waarschijnlijk geen politieke advertenties meer tegenkomen. Die zijn sinds maandag verboden. Maar in de laatste week dat het wel nog mocht gaven politieke partijen gezamenlijk meer dan 120.000 euro uit, zag de NOS. Het verbod werd door moederbedrijf Meta ingevoerd in lijn met nieuwe Europese regelgeving die vrijdag inging. Vooral GroenLinks-PvdA en de Partij voor de Dieren trokken vlak voor de deadline nog hun portemonnee. Zij betaalden respectievelijk 36.000 en 25.000 euro voor politieke reclame. \"Dit was de laatste week dat het nog kon, dus daar hebben we gebruik van gemaakt\", zegt een woordvoerder van GroenLinks-PvdA. In de gehele laatste maand voor het verbod steekt Forum voor Democratie er met kop en schouders bovenuit. De partij betaalde in totaal ruim 80.000 euro voor advertenties, gevolgd door D66 met meer dan 60.000 euro. GroenLinks-PvdA, Partij voor de Dieren en de SP volgden met zo'n 35.000 euro per partij. De ene partij besteedt veel minder aan politieke advertenties op Instagram en Facebook dan andere: Opvallend is dat de PVV sinds de val van het kabinet in juni nauwelijks iets uitgaf aan advertenties. Lijsttrekker Geert Wilders promootte één keer, voor nog geen 200 euro, zijn komst naar een demonstratie tegen een azc in Helmond. Hij heeft bij elkaar opgeteld ruim 900.000 volgers op Facebook en Instagram en heeft daardoor sowieso een groter bereik. Micro-targeting Politieke partijen proberen via advertenties groepen te bereiken waarvan ze denken dat er stemmen te halen vallen. Daarbij wordt privacygevoelige informatie gebruikt. Dat heet micro-targeting en is omstreden, omdat je kiezers zo onbewust kan beïnvloeden. Mede om die reden zijn in de laatste weken voor de verkiezingen politieke advertenties op sociale media verboden. In aanloop naar dat verbod maakte aan aantal partijen er nog wel flink gebruik van. Zo richtte de BoerBurgerBeweging (BBB) zich op fans van de Zwarte Cross, André Hazes, Boer Zoekt Vrouw, paardrijden en katten. D66 koos dan weer voor podcastluisteraars, verpleegkundigen en starters op de woningmarkt. En GroenLinks-PvdA ging voor liefhebbers van lezen, goede doelen en musea. \"Wij denken dat buitenactiviteiten, volkse sporten en het Nederlandse lied passen bij mensen die de BBB als optie hebben om op te stemmen\", zegt BBB-campagneleider Henk Vermeer. \"Maar we kozen vaker niet voor microtargeten, omdat je er ook potentiële kiezers mee uitsluit.\" Regio Politieke advertenties van Denk richtten zich deels tot Arabisch- en Turks-sprekenden. \"Wij vinden het belangrijk dat zoveel mogelijk Nederlanders weten dat er op 29 oktober verkiezingen zijn\", zegt een woordvoerder van Denk. \"Daarom doen wij dit primair en hoofdzakelijk in het Nederlands, en daarnaast ook in andere talen.\" Politieke partijen kunnen hun advertenties ook richten aan mensen in bepaalde regio's. Zo zag het CDA vooral kiezerspotentieel in Overijssel, Gelderland, Brabant en Drenthe, richtte BBB zich ook op Friesland en probeerde de Fryske Nasjonale Partij juist kiezers in meer provincies aan zich te binden. Partijleider in beeld Ook valt op dat sommige politieke partijen duidelijk de partijleider in beeld brengen, zoals het CDA, terwijl andere partijen daar niet voor kiezen. Het CDA stak de laatste maand de helft van de advertentie-uitgaven in posts op het profiel van Henri Bontenbal zelf. De VVD betaalde tot eind juni dit jaar vooral voor video's waarin partijleider Dilan Yesilgöz centraal staat, maar wisselde daarna vaker af met partijgenoten Vincent Karremans, Ruben Brekelmans en Eelco Heinen. Ook stond vanaf toen vooral het partijprogramma centraal. Wellicht niet geheel toevallig is in die tijd de beruchte rel met Douwe Bob begon. Die leidde tot zowel publiekelijke als interne kritiek op Yesilgöz. Haagse rellen De demonstraties en rellen op het Malieveld in Den Haag van vorige maand zorgden ook voor veel politieke advertenties; zeker zes partijen gaven er geld aan uit. Voor de VVD, FVD, JA21 en Bij1 ging dat slechts om een paar honderd euro. De BBB betaalde meer dan 1000 euro en D66 gaf bijna 10.000 euro uit aan vier advertenties over het onderwerp. Partijen kozen daarbij voor uiteenlopende invalshoeken. Waar de BBB en FVD in hun advertenties de focus legden op de zorgen die de demonstranten hadden, greep de VVD de rellen aan om plannen voor het versterken van de politie te promoten. D66 en Bij1 grepen de rellen aan om te focussen op overeenkomsten tussen mensen en \"positieve krachten\", in plaats van extremen en verdeling die volgens Bij1 door \"Haagse politici\" worden aangewakkerd. D66 betaalde bovendien voor een post waarin ze hun partijkantoor opknapten. Organisch Nu adverteren op sociale media is verboden, kunnen partijen nog slechts op niet-betaalde manieren stemmers via hun socialemediaprofielen bereiken. Het aantal volgers maakt daarbij uit. In het aantal volgers zijn de verschillen tussen partijen groot. PVV-leider Geert Wilders heeft er verreweg het meest. Geert Wilders wordt in aantal volgers gevolgd door FVD en BBB. GroenLinks-PvdA bungelt met vierduizend volgers in de onderste regio, mede doordat GroenLinks en PvdA in 2023 besloten samen door te gaan en de pagina dus nog niet heel oud is.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586030","published_date":"2025-10-11T05:05:32","collected_date":"2025-10-11T06:34:01.540590","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":821,"author":null,"raw_content_length":6427,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":4.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Forum voor Democratie","NOS","Partij voor de Dieren"],"persons":["Meta","D66"],"locations":["Politieke"],"monetary":["60.000 euro","euro","80.000 euro","120.000 euro"]},"char_count":5260,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Politieke partijen","vlak voor verbod","euros","sociale media","Wie","deze week","zijn tijdlijn","Instagram","scrolt","geen politieke advertenties"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Politieke partijen":2.0,"vlak voor verbod":2.0,"euros":2.0,"sociale media":2.0,"Wie":1.0,"deze week":1.0,"zijn tijdlijn":1.0,"Instagram":1.0,"scrolt":1.0,"geen politieke advertenties":1.0}},"age_hours":1.5719668880555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.842,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8316,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7155,"joy":0.0196,"surprise":0.1022,"sadness":0.0331,"fear":0.0371,"anger":0.0409,"disgust":0.0516},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses a ban on political advertising on social media in the Netherlands due to concerns about micro-targeting and privacy.
