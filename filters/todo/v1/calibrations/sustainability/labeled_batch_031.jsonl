Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\\%, cuts computation by 35\\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25034","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.530003","language":"en","tags":["csma","cssy","computer-science","eesssy","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Heming Fu, Guojun Xiong, Shan Lin","raw_content_length":1804,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MARLIN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1803,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MARLIN","Multi","arXiv250925034v2","Announce Type","Abstract","extreme weather events","water disasters","growing threats","global communities","adaptive reservoir management"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MARLIN":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv250925034v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"extreme weather events":1.0,"water disasters":1.0,"growing threats":1.0,"global communities":1.0,"adaptive reservoir management":1.0}},"age_hours":2.78295338,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5449999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.891,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2403,"joy":0.0069,"surprise":0.0171,"sadness":0.0145,"fear":0.7023,"anger":0.015,"disgust":0.0039},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"MARLIN shows promise in improving water resource management by integrating bio-inspired rules and LLMs. The article presents concrete improvements in uncertainty handling (23%), computation time (35%), and flood response (68%) based on experiments using real-world USGS data.

Yet significant challenges remain: assessment methods are fragmented, tests lack standardisation, and feedback loops between developers and regulators are weak. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Sandbox Configurator, a modular open-source framework that enables users to select domain-relevant tests from a shared library and generate customised sandbox environments with integrated dashboards. Its plug-in architecture aims to support both open and proprietary modules, fostering a shared ecosystem of interoperable AI assessment services. The framework aims to address multiple stakeholders: CAs gain structured workflows for applying legal obligations; technical experts can integrate robust evaluation methods; and AI providers access a transparent pathway to compliance.

Existing models often fall short in offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks, while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios. Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale, general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25687","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.530870","language":"en","tags":["research","csro","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":235,"author":"Xinda Xue, Junjun Hu, Minghua Luo, Xie Shichao, Jintao Chen, Zixun Xie, Quan Kuichen, Guo Wei, Mu Xu, Zedong Chu","raw_content_length":1972,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.175,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OmniNav"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1971,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["OmniNav","A Unified Framework","Prospective Exploration","Visual","arXiv250925687v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Embodied navigation","a core challenge","intelligent robots","the comprehension"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"OmniNav":3.0,"A Unified Framework":2.0,"Prospective Exploration":2.0,"Visual":2.0,"arXiv250925687v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Embodied navigation":1.0,"a core challenge":1.0,"intelligent robots":1.0,"the comprehension":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7829839205555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.772499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9545,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.768,"joy":0.0289,"surprise":0.0953,"sadness":0.0147,"fear":0.0713,"anger":0.0165,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a unified framework for robot navigation, OmniNav, which has been deployed in real-world settings.

To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification.

The mainstream sequence parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency, restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology. Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention.

However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly, common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints, OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories.

It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) incorporates repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format.

This additional freedom has some advantages, including potentially more efficient code, which is one of the main reasons why unsafe code is used extensively throughout Rust's standard library. However, because unsafe code also re-opens the door to undefined behaviour, Amazon has convened a community to verify the safety of the standard library, and in particular the unsafe code contained therein. Given that this effort is done in public and open-sourced, we have access to a wealth of information on how people are verifying the standard library, as well as what is currently possible and what still appears to be beyond the state of the art for verified software. In this paper, we discuss the lessons learned thus far from this verification effort, from both our work on it, as well as that of the broader community. In particular, we start by reviewing what has been accomplished thus far, as well as the main tools used (specifically, their advantages and their limitations). We then focus on some of the remaining fundamental obstacles to verifying the standard library, and propose potential solutions to overcome them.

When it comes to nonconvex minimax optimization, however, current convergence analyses of gradient descent ascent (GDA) combined with adaptive stepsizes require careful tuning of hyper-parameters and the knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. Such a discrepancy arises from the primal-dual nature of minimax problems and the necessity of delicate time-scale separation between the primal and dual updates in attaining convergence. In this work, we propose a single-loop adaptive GDA algorithm called TiAda for nonconvex minimax optimization that automatically adapts to the time-scale separation. Our algorithm is fully parameter-agnostic and can achieve near-optimal complexities simultaneously in deterministic and stochastic settings of nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems.

A contemporary approach to combat overfitting is offered by distributionally robust problem formulations that consider all data-generating distributions close to the empirical distribution derived from historical samples, where 'closeness' is determined by the Wasserstein distance. While such formulations show significant promise in prediction tasks where all input features are continuous, they scale exponentially when discrete features are present. Methodology/results: We demonstrate that distributionally robust mixed-feature classification and regression problems can indeed be solved in polynomial time. Our proof relies on classical ellipsoid method-based solution schemes that do not scale well in practice. To overcome this limitation, we develop a practically efficient (yet, in the worst case, exponential time) cutting plane-based algorithm that admits a polynomial time separation oracle, despite the presence of exponentially many constraints.

We trained and evaluated kernel ridge regression machines using variable amounts of computational and experimental training data. Our synthetic datasets comprised i) two na\\\"ive functions based on many-body theory; ii) binding energy estimates between a protein and a mutagenised peptide; and iii) solvation energies of two 6-heavy atom structural graphs, while the experimental dataset consisted of a full deep mutational scan of the binding protein GB1. In contrast to typical data-error scaling laws, our results showed discontinuous monotonic phase transitions during learning, observed as rapid drops in the test error at particular thresholds of training data. We observed two learning regimes, which we call saturated and asymptotic decay, and found that they are conditioned by the level of complexity (i.e. number of mutations) enclosed in the training set. We show that during training on this class of problems, the predictions were clustered by the ML models employed in the calibration plots. Furthermore, we present an alternative strategy to normalize learning curves (LCs) and introduce the concept of mutant-based shuffling. This work has implications for machine learning on mutagenisable discrete spaces such as chemical properties or protein phenotype prediction, and improves basic understanding of concepts in statistical learning theory.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05167","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.580770","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","physicschem-ph","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Vanni Doffini, O.

The large number of sequences and the inherently complicated nature of protein structures make it challenging to analyze such data. Finding patterns and enhancing subsequent research requires the use of dimensionality reduction and feature selection approaches. Recently, a method called Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP) has been proposed as an effective method for biological sequencing data. The CCP technique is still costly to compute even though it is effective for sequence visualization. Furthermore, its utility for classifying molecular sequences is still uncertain. To solve these two problems, we present a Nearest Neighbor Correlated Clustering and Projection (CCP-NN)-based technique for efficiently preprocessing molecular sequence data. To group related molecular sequences and produce representative supersequences, CCP makes use of sequence-to-sequence correlations. As opposed to conventional methods, CCP doesn't rely on matrix diagonalization, therefore it can be applied to a range of machine-learning problems. We estimate the density map and compute the correlation using a nearest-neighbor search technique. We performed molecular sequence classification using CCP and CCP-NN representations to assess the efficacy of our proposed approach. Our findings show that CCP-NN considerably improves classification task accuracy as well as significantly outperforms CCP in terms of computational runtime.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04922","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.583867","language":"en","tags":["q-biogn","computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Sarwan Ali, Prakash Chourasia, Bipin Koirala, Murray Patterson","raw_content_length":1668,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nearest Neighbor CCP arXiv:2409.04922v2","Nearest Neighbor Correlated Clustering and Projection","CCP","Correlated Clustering and Projection"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1667,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nearest Neighbor CCP","replace-cross Abstract","Molecular sequence analysis","several biological processes","protein-protein interactions","functional annotation","classification","The large number","sequences","the inherently complicated nature"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nearest Neighbor CCP":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Molecular sequence analysis":1.0,"several biological processes":1.0,"protein-protein interactions":1.0,"functional annotation":1.0,"classification":1.0,"The large number":1.0,"sequences":1.0,"the inherently complicated nature":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7841314197222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8203,"joy":0.0172,"surprise":0.0814,"sadness":0.0123,"fear":0.041,"anger":0.0226,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new algorithm (CCP-NN) for molecular sequence analysis, which could potentially improve the efficiency of biological research.

In the worst case, general QSP algorithms are expensive due to the application of multi-controlled gates required to build the quantum state. Here, we propose an algorithm that detects whether a given quantum state can be factored into substates, increasing the efficiency of compiling the QSP circuit when we initialize states with some level of unentanglement. The simplification is done by eliminating controls of quantum multiplexers, significantly reducing circuit depth and the number of CNOT gates with a better execution and compilation time than the previous QSP algorithms. Considering efficiency in terms of depth and number of CNOT gates, our method is competitive with the methods in the literature. However, when it comes to run-time and compilation efficiency, our result is significantly better, and the experiments show that by increasing the number of qubits, the gap between the temporal efficiency of the methods increases.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05618","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.584323","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","cset","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Jos\\'e A. de Carvalho, Carlos A.

However, the lower bound was proved when the range $Z$ is sufficiently large (i.e., $|{Z}|=\\Omega(FG)$).

In addition, the lower bound $\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{G}+F^{1/3}G^{1/6}M^{1/6}\\right)$ is provided for even smaller range $Z=[M]$ with every $M\\in [2,F+G]$ by reducing the claw problem for $|{Z}|= F+G$.

Obtaining a radar signal to match a specified AF magnitude is a bi-variate variant of the well-known phase retrieval problem. Prior approaches to this problem were either limited to a few classes of waveforms or lacked a computable procedure to estimate the signal. Our recent work provided a framework for solving this problem for both band- and time-limited signals using non-convex optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach WaveMax that formulates waveform recovery as a convex optimization problem by relying on the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)-based AF. We exploit the fact that AF of the FrFT of the original signal is equivalent to a rotation of the original AF. In particular, we reconstruct the radar signal by solving a low-rank minimization problem, which approximates the waveform using the leading eigenvector of a matrix derived from the AF.

However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, or demand costly retraining when priors change, limiting their utility, particularly in sequential inference problems such as real-time sensor fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce the Distribution Transformer -- a novel architecture that can learn arbitrary distribution-to-distribution mappings. Our method can be trained to map a prior to the corresponding posterior, conditioned on some dataset -- thus performing approximate Bayesian inference. Our novel architecture represents a prior distribution as a (universally-approximating) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and transforms it into a GMM representation of the posterior. The components of the GMM attend to each other via self-attention, and to the datapoints via cross-attention. We demonstrate that Distribution Transformers both maintain flexibility to vary the prior, and significantly reduces computation times-from minutes to milliseconds-while achieving log-likelihood performance on par with or superior to existing approximate inference methods across tasks such as sequential inference, quantum system parameter inference, and Gaussian Process predictive posterior inference with hyperpriors.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02463","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.586427","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"George Whittle, Juliusz Ziomek, Jacob Rawling, Michael A Osborne","raw_content_length":1522,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference With On arXiv:2502.02463v2","GMM","the Distribution Transformer"],"persons":["Announce Type","Gaussian Mixture Model"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1521,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Distribution Transformers","Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference","arXiv250202463v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Bayesian inference","a principled framework","reasoning","uncertainty","its widespread adoption","the intractability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Distribution Transformers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Distribution Transformers":2.0,"Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference":2.0,"arXiv250202463v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Bayesian inference":1.0,"a principled framework":1.0,"reasoning":1.0,"uncertainty":1.0,"its widespread adoption":1.0,"the intractability":1.0}},"age_hours":2.784221065833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8155,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6369,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8543,"joy":0.0135,"surprise":0.0279,"sadness":0.0196,"fear":0.0287,"anger":0.0352,"disgust":0.0207},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method (Distribution Transformer) for approximate Bayesian inference, which significantly reduces computation times for sequential inference problems.

Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit analogous category-selective neurons and how these representations are shaped by language experience. Using an fMRI-inspired functional localizer approach, we identified face-, body-, place-, and word-selective neurons in deep networks presented with category images and scrambled controls. Both the purely visual ResNet and a linguistically supervised Lang-Learned ResNet contained category-selective neurons that increased in proportion across layers. However, compared to the vision-only model, the Lang-Learned ResNet showed a greater number but lower specificity of category-selective neurons, along with reduced spatial localization and attenuated activation strength-indicating a shift toward more distributed, semantically aligned coding. These effects were replicated in the large-scale vision-language model CLIP.

Bioinformatics is a domain where fully autonomous AI-driven discovery may be near, but no extensive benchmarks for measuring progress have been introduced to date. We therefore present the Bioinformatics Benchmark (BixBench), a dataset comprising over 50 real-world scenarios of practical biological data analysis with nearly 300 associated open-answer questions designed to measure the ability of LLM-based agents to explore biological datasets, perform long, multi-step analytical trajectories, and interpret the nuanced results of those analyses. We evaluate the performance of two frontier LLMs (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using a custom agent framework we open source. We find that even the latest frontier models only achieve 17% accuracy in the open-answer regime, and no better than random in a multiple-choice setting.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ff195ad04dd8","title":"Quantum umlaut information","content":"arXiv:2503.21479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\\rho = \\min_{\\sigma_B} D(\\rho_A\\otimes \\sigma_B\\|\\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21479","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.589713","language":"en","tags":["mathit","math-ph","computer-science","preprints","csit","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Filippo Girardi, Aadil Oufkir, Bartosz Regula, Marco Tomamichel, Mario Berta, Ludovico Lami","raw_content_length":1943,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["arXiv:2404.16101","Quantum"],"persons":["Girardi","U(A;B)_\\rho"],"locations":["Nuradha et al."],"monetary":["\\rho_{AB}$","D$."]},"char_count":1942,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantum","information","replace-cross Abstract","the quantum umlaut information","a correlation measure","bipartite quantum states","rho_AB","a reversed variant","the quantum mutual information","UAB_rho"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the quantum umlaut information"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantum":2.0,"information":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the quantum umlaut information":1.0,"a correlation measure":1.0,"bipartite quantum states":1.0,"rho_AB":1.0,"a reversed variant":1.0,"the quantum mutual information":1.0,"UAB_rho":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7843156155555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8751,"joy":0.0161,"surprise":0.0872,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.0077,"disgust":0.0033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on quantum information theory, specifically the 'quantum umlaut information'.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_7f35eed54513","title":"PDCS: A Primal","content":"arXiv:2505.00311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Primal-Dual Conic Programming Solver (PDCS), a large-scale conic programming solver with GPU enhancements. Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes.

Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance, provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge.

Recent works have shown that transformers achieve this by implementing gradient descent in their forward passes. Such results, however, are restricted to standard transformer architectures, which handle finite-dimensional inputs. In the space of PDE surrogate modeling, a generalization of transformers to handle infinite-dimensional function inputs, known as \"continuum transformers,\" has been proposed and similarly observed to exhibit in-context learning. Despite impressive empirical performance, such in-context learning has yet to be theoretically characterized. We herein demonstrate that continuum transformers perform in-context operator learning by performing gradient descent in an operator RKHS. We demonstrate this using novel proof strategies that leverage a generalized representer theorem for Hilbert spaces and gradient flows over the space of functionals of a Hilbert space. We additionally show the operator learned in context is the Bayes Optimal Predictor in the infinite depth limit of the transformer. We then provide empirical validations of this optimality result and demonstrate that the parameters under which such gradient descent is performed are recovered through the continuum transformer training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17838","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.593008","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Abhiti Mishra, Yash Patel, Ambuj Tewari","raw_content_length":1520,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PDE"],"persons":["Continuum Transformers Perform"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1519,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Continuum Transformers","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Transformers","the ability","context","their predictive accuracy","a task","parameter updates","the placement"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Continuum Transformers","Transformers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Continuum Transformers":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Transformers":1.0,"the ability":1.0,"context":1.0,"their predictive accuracy":1.0,"a task":1.0,"parameter updates":1.0,"the placement":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7844301055555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9185,"joy":0.035,"surprise":0.0245,"sadness":0.0031,"fear":0.0026,"anger":0.0094,"disgust":0.0068},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical advancements in continuum transformers for PDE surrogate modeling, demonstrating in-context operator learning via gradient descent.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3969f3877036","title":"MAMBO: High","content":"arXiv:2506.08677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

TCP couples a modern quantile forecaster with a split-conformal calibration layer on a rolling window and, in its TCP-RM variant, augments the conformal threshold with a single online Robbins-Monro (RM) offset to steer coverage toward a target level in real time. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and a rolling Quantile Regression (QR) baseline across equities (S&P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Three results are consistent across assets. First, rolling QR yields the sharpest intervals but is materially under-calibrated (e.g., S&P 500: 83.2% vs. 95% target). Second, TCP (and TCP-RM) achieves near-nominal coverage across assets, with intervals that are wider than Historical Simulation in this evaluation (e.g., S&P 500: 5.21 vs. 5.06). Third, the RM update changes calibration and width only marginally at our default hyperparameters. Crisis-window visualizations around March 2020 show TCP/TCP-RM expanding and then contracting their interval bands promptly as volatility spikes and recedes, with red dots marking days where realized returns fall outside the reported 95% interval (miscoverage). A sensitivity study confirms robustness to window size and step-size choices. Overall, TCP provides a practical, theoretically grounded solution to calibrated uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, bridging statistical inference and machine learning for risk forecasting.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.594005","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Agnideep Aich, Ashit Baran Aich, Dipak C.

In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification.

Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations.

In contrast to traditional rigid reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), an FIM consists of an array of elements, each capable of independently tuning electromagnetic signals, while flexibly adjusting its position along the direction perpendicular to the surface. In contrast to traditional rigid metasurfaces, FIM is capable of morphing its surface shape to attain better channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication systems aided by a transmissive FIM. In the SISO scenario, we jointly optimize the FIM phase shift matrix and surface shape to maximize the end-to-end channel gain. First, we derive the optimal phase-shift matrix for each tentative FIM surface shape to decompose the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem into multiple one-dimensional subproblems. Then, we utilize the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the multi-interval gradient descent (MIGD) method for updating the FIM's surface shape to maximize the channel gain.

Each slot has a tunable component that consumes low power compared to typical analog components like phase shifters. This makes DMAs a potential candidate to minimize the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays. In this paper, we investigate the use of DMAs in a wideband communication setting with practical DMA design characteristics. We develop approximations for the DMA beamforming gain that account for the effects of waveguide attenuation, element frequency-selectivity, and limited reconfigurability of the tunable components as a function of the signal bandwidth. The approximations allow for key insights into the wideband performance of DMAs in terms of different design variables. We develop a simple successive beamforming algorithm to improve the wideband performance of DMAs by sequentially configuring each DMA element. Simulation results for a line-of-sight (LOS) wideband system show the accuracy of the approximations with the simulated DMA model in terms of spectral efficiency. We also find that the proposed successive beamforming algorithm increases the overall spectral efficiency of the DMA-based wideband system compared with a baseline DMA beamforming method.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07827","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:23.734479","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","research","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Joseph M.

AHRS utilize inertial sensor measurements to estimate platform orientation. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in multiple inertial measurement units (MIMU) arrays to improve navigation accuracy and robustness. A particularly challenging MIMU implementation is the gyro-free (GF) configuration, in which angular velocity is derived solely from accelerometer measurements. While the GF configurations have multiple benefits, including outlier detection and in angular acceleration measurements, their main drawbacks are inherent instability and an increased divergence rate. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel symmetrical MIMU formulation, in which the IMUs are arranged in symmetric diagonal pairs to decouple linear and rotational acceleration components. To this end, we derive the theoretical foundations for the symmetrical MIMU formulation of the GF equations, develop a nonlinear least squares estimation process, and integrate statistical hypothesis testing into an AHRS error-state extended Kalman filter. We validate our approach using real-world datasets containing 85 minutes of navigation data recorded on both airborne and land platforms.

Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full multi-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely performed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently available across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV) scans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging resources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such as contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a mismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of real-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively leverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a Dual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction from single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training. DuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes single-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase scans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment. Structured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature discrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates clinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance and missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design. Our framework aligns with current clinical application needs and provides a general solution for recurrence risk prediction in HCC, supporting more informed decision-making.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07347","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:23.747944","language":"en","tags":["q-bioqm","systems","eessiv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Hsin-Pei Yu, Si-Qin Lyu, Yi-Hsien Hsieh, Weichung Wang, Tung-Hung Su, Jia-Horng Kao, Che Lin","raw_content_length":1955,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HCC","Limited Multi-Phase CT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1954,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Limited Multi-Phase CT","arXiv251007347v1 Announce Type","cross","Early recurrence ER prediction","curative-intent resection","a critical challenge","the clinical management","hepatocellular carcinoma","HCC","contrast-enhanced computed tomography"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Limited Multi-Phase CT":2.0,"arXiv251007347v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Early recurrence ER prediction":1.0,"curative-intent resection":1.0,"a critical challenge":1.0,"the clinical management":1.0,"hepatocellular carcinoma":1.0,"HCC":1.0,"contrast-enhanced computed tomography":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7853016816666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.815,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0638,"sadness":0.0367,"fear":0.059,"anger":0.0071,"disgust":0.0038},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a new framework (DuoProto) for improving early recurrence prediction of HCC using limited CT scan data.

To address this, we first take a critical look at previous deep scheduler efforts. Secondly, we enhance State-of-the-Art (SoTA) deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and adapt them to train our deep scheduler. In particular, we propose a novel combination of training techniques for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a new Distributional Soft Actor-Critic Discrete (DSACD) algorithm, which outperformed other variants tested. These improvements were achieved while maintaining minimal actor network complexity, making them suitable for real-time computing environments. Furthermore, entropy learning in SACD was fine-tuned to accommodate resource allocation action spaces of varying sizes. Our proposed deep schedulers exhibited strong generalization across different bandwidths, number of Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) layers, and traffic models.

The visual observation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. Direct RGB quantification is unreliable because RGB intensities vary with staining and imaging conditions. Stain unmixing offers a promising alternative by quantifying dye amounts. In previous work, multispectral imaging was utilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain. However, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the number of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel training-free Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images. This model enforces (i) nonnegativity, (ii) weighted nucleus sparsity for hematoxylin, and (iii) total variation smoothness, resulting in a convex optimization problem. Our method achieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against the results of multispectral imaging. We further used it to distinguish cells in lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a precancerous gastric-type adenocarcinoma lesion, from normal endocervical cells. Stain abundance features clearly separated the two groups, and a classifier based on stain abundance achieved 98.0% accuracy. By converting subjective color impressions into numerical markers, this technique highlights the strong promise of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20450","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:23.757544","language":"en","tags":["q-bioqm","systems","eessiv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Nanxin Gong, Saori Takeyama, Masahiro Yamaguchi, Takumi Urata, Fumikazu Kimura, Keiko Ishii","raw_content_length":1537,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RGB Image Using Weighted Nucleus Sparsity and Total Variation Regularization arXiv:2506.20450v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract","RGB"],"persons":["Stain Unmixing"],"locations":["hematoxylin"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1536,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing","RGB Image","Weighted Nucleus Sparsity","Total Variation Regularization","arXiv250620450v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The Papanicolaou stain","five dyes","extensive color information","cervical cancer cytological screening"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing":2.0,"RGB Image":2.0,"Weighted Nucleus Sparsity":2.0,"Total Variation Regularization":2.0,"arXiv250620450v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The Papanicolaou stain":1.0,"five dyes":1.0,"extensive color information":1.0,"cervical cancer cytological screening":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7856180230555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0775000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7845,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7619,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0194,"sadness":0.0488,"fear":0.0337,"anger":0.0213,"disgust":0.1095},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel training-free Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images.

A mathematical expression is then provided to describe \\textit{chirpons}, and their behavior is explored through the interaction of a super-bandwidth wavepacket -- containing two singularities -- with a damped harmonic oscillator, a fundamental model for many physical systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_f133db05dfe1","title":"Monthly Rural","content":"arXiv:2510.07351v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge worldwide, with urbanisation and population density identified as key factors influencing risk. This study analyses monthly accident data from 2009 to 2023 across 632 parliamentary constituencies in England, Wales, and Scotland, using an area-normalised approach based on population density. Segmented power law models consistently identified breakpoints separating sublinear rural from superlinear urban scaling behaviours. Seasonal variation in scaling exponents was pronounced in rural regions but less evident in urban ones. Fourier-based cross-spectral analysis of yearly cycles revealed systematic phase shifts: rural exponents lagged pre-exponential factors by 4.5 months, while urban exponents were 2.7 months out of phase, producing a 5.3 month shift between rural and urban exponents. These findings highlight the importance of pre-exponentials-defined as the expected density of accidents at unit population density-as comparable descaled metrics, revealing both long-term national declines and recurring seasonal peaks. Notably, the phase offsets suggest structurally distinct causes of rural and urban accident risk, with urban regions exhibiting increasing acceleration in accident scaling, potentially linked to growth in vehicle numbers, size, and weight. Residuals, modelled with the Type I Generalised Logistic Distribution (GLD), captured skewness and heterogeneity more effectively than normal assumptions. Geospatial mapping highlighted persistent urban hotspots alongside rural and coastal constituencies with systematically lower accident densities than predicted. Together, these findings advance understanding of how density and urbanisation shape accident risk and provide evidence to support more targeted road safety interventions and policy planning.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07351","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.034504","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","statap","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Isabel Copsey, Quentin Hanley, Jack Sutton","raw_content_length":1890,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Monthly Rural arXiv:2510.07351v1 Announce Type:"],"persons":[],"locations":["Scotland","England","Wales"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1889,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Monthly Rural","arXiv251007351v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Road traffic accidents","a major public health challenge","urbanisation and population density","key factors","risk","This study","monthly accident data"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Monthly Rural":2.0,"arXiv251007351v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Road traffic accidents":1.0,"a major public health challenge":1.0,"urbanisation and population density":1.0,"key factors":1.0,"risk":1.0,"This study":1.0,"monthly accident data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.786133993611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.436,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2815,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0152,"sadness":0.0153,"fear":0.623,"anger":0.041,"disgust":0.0182},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes accident data to understand the impact of urbanization on road safety.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_4bdd2421ec55","title":"Analysis of divergent dynamics of exactly factorized electron","content":"arXiv:2510.07460v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Exact Factorization (XF) of molecular wavefunctions can be viewed as an 'electronic wavepacket' framework for quantum dynamics. It is an appealing alternative to the conventional non-adiabatic dynamics, unfolding in the space of coupled electronic eigenstates. However, implementation of the non-linear XF equations for general systems presents a formidable challenge: the XF counterparts to the non-adiabatic coupling involve division by the nuclear probability density, which leads to severe numerical instabilities in the low-density regions of space. In case of the non-adiabatic dynamics the effect of coupling is relatively smooth, but this theoretical framework becomes impractical when numerous electronic states are involved. In this paper the origin of the XF-specific challenge is analyzed analytically. We demonstrate that the problem arises when the factorized wavefunction diverges, even without the explicit coupling of the Born-Huang electronic states used to describe the molecular wavefunction. Using a 'minimal' model of the photodissociation, we derive expressions for the XF dynamics and locate the source of the XF instability. We analyze the dependence of this instability on the nuclear wavefunction bifurcation in the stationary and moving frames of reference, the latter associated with the quantum trajectory ensemble describing the nuclear XF wavepacket in a compact form. We show that the near-singular behavior persists in the moving frame and in the atomic basis representation of the electronic wavefunction. This model and insight into the root of the XF implementation challenge will help to address the issue, leading to further development of the XF methods.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07460","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.035734","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicschem-ph","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Julian Stetzler (Department of Chemistry,Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA), Sophya Garashchuk (Department of Chemistry,Biochemistry, University of South Carolina, Columbia, USA), Vitaly A.

This method is based on the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction, with the nuclei evolving under a complex time-dependent potential which captures the key features of dynamics in the nuclear subspace. The complementary electronic component of the molecular wavefunction is normalized to one for all nuclear configurations. We implement and employ FENDy to model the dynamics of H$_2^+$ molecular ion under a femtosecond laser pulse. The electronic wavefunction is represented within the standard electronic structure bases without referencing the electronic eigenstates. The nuclear wavefunction is represented as a quantum-trajectory ensemble, which in principle circumvents the exponential scaling of the numerical cost with the system size.

In other words, they are the eigenstates of the time-independent Schrodinger equation with a linear potential. In the domain of optics, laser beams that are spatially shaped as Airy functions (`Airy beams') have been shown to exhibit a prominent lobe that follows a curved path, rather than propagating in a straight line, and which has self-healing properties in the presence of obstacles. Here, we observe the presence of Airy resonances in two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of a lattice of holes in a silicon slab. Analogously to electrons in a linear potential, these Airy resonances arise due to a linear spatial variation in the lattice constant of the holes. We map the electromagnetic description of the photonic crystal onto a 2D non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation with a linear potential, which we call a `superpotential'. The non-Hermiticity appears in the form of a complex effective mass due to out-of-plane radiation and fundamentally alters the collective optical response of the Airy resonances.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07522","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.037313","language":"en","tags":["physics","preprints","research","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Zeyu Zhang, Brian Gould, Maria Barsukova, Mikael C.

Conventional molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation. Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to chemistry and biophysics.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07589","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.038934","language":"en","tags":["statml","physics","physicschem-ph","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Juan Viguera Diez, Mathias Schreiner, Simon Olsson","raw_content_length":1255,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nanosecond Time arXiv:2510.07589v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1254,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Transferable Generative Models Bridge Femtosecond","Nanosecond Time","arXiv251007589v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","molecular structure","dynamics","reactivity","bridging processes","widely separated time scales","Conventional molecular dynamics simulations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Transferable Generative Models Bridge Femtosecond":2.0,"Nanosecond Time":2.0,"arXiv251007589v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"molecular structure":1.0,"dynamics":1.0,"reactivity":1.0,"bridging processes":1.0,"widely separated time scales":1.0,"Conventional molecular dynamics simulations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7862908755555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8585,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7717,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9124,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0318,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.0134,"anger":0.015,"disgust":0.0126},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a deep generative modeling framework that accelerates molecular dynamics simulations.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_080f0ba0fe4c","title":"Observation of Crystalline Nonlocal Volume Plasmon Waves","content":"arXiv:2510.07612v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \\sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\\Gamma K$ \\& $\\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07612","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.040263","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Sathwik Bharadwaj, Makoto Schreiber, Jungho Mun, Sam Ruttiman, Pronoy Das, Misa Hayashida, Marek Malac, Peter Nordlander, Zubin Jacob","raw_content_length":1334,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Plasmon Waves"],"locations":[],"monetary":["0.7$"]},"char_count":1333,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Observation","Crystalline Nonlocal Volume Plasmon Waves","new Abstract","plasmonics","nonlocal effects","the material response","optical excitations","the spatial correlations","the excitation","a classical free electron gas system"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Observation":2.0,"Crystalline Nonlocal Volume Plasmon Waves":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"plasmonics":1.0,"nonlocal effects":1.0,"the material response":1.0,"optical excitations":1.0,"the spatial correlations":1.0,"the excitation":1.0,"a classical free electron gas system":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7863347066666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.637,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9274,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8443,"joy":0.0107,"surprise":0.0684,"sadness":0.0115,"fear":0.0129,"anger":0.0246,"disgust":0.0276},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves in silicon.
