{"id":"community_social_dev_to_9ebd44665372","title":"React Hook for the Battery Status API","content":"Hello and welcome to my first React posts. Because I love the Web and I'm also a true lover of the React framework, I'm very happy to share this post. But that's enough, let's get into the topic! I do this post, because I created a custom hook useBatteryStatus. I will explain what needs to be done to create the hook and later show you how you can install it and use it for yourself. But let's start from the beginning. What is the Battery Status API? If you didn't know what the API is doing or what can be done with Battery Status API, I already have a post about Hands on Battery Status API. Afterwards you can continue here. The Hook When working with React, I love to make things small and easy to reuse later on. That's also the reason why I love hooks and why they are so successful. That's why I decided to implement this Web API as React hook. I decided to choose the name useBatteryStatus. Get the BatteryManager As we learned from the other post, there is a BatteryManager object that will be returned by the Promise request for the API. This object is returned once per browser window. In react each hook has it's own instance and that's a bit tricky in this case. Because if we would do the Promise request in every hook instance, there would be only one hook that will work. All other hooks would lose the event listeners and will not update. Let's have a look into the code: let batteryManager: BatteryManager | null = null; async function getBatteryManager() { if (!navigator.getBattery) { console.warn(\"Battery Status API is not supported on this browser.\"); return null; } if (!batteryManager) { batteryManager = await navigator.getBattery(); } return batteryManager; } So we would call this function instead of always calling the getBattery(). Let's check this code quickly together. First of all, we check if the browser does support the feature. If there is no support we return a message to the console and return null for the BatteryManager object. Afterwards, if there is not a batteryManager requested until now (first hook instance) we will request the BatteryManager and wait for the Promise to be returned. If there is already a batteryManager (if it is used multiple times on your site) we will just return the saved batteryManager object. So there will be just one call for the getBattery() function in general. Initialize Hook data First of all, let's have a look at the data we like to return later on. This is our interface: interface BatteryStatus { charging: boolean; level: number; chargingTime: number; dischargingTime: number; } So nothing that will surprise you here. All the data is available inside the BatteryManager object as well. This is how we initialize the data: const [batteryStatus, setBatteryStatus] = useState({ charging: false, level: 0, chargingTime: Infinity, dischargingTime: Infinity }); battery = await getBatteryManager(); if (!battery) return; setBatteryStatus({ charging: battery.charging, level: battery.level, chargingTime: battery.chargingTime, dischargingTime: battery.dischargingTime }); As you can see, we are using the function, that was shown before, to receive the BatteryManager object. If the browser supports the Battery Status API the data will be updated with the current state by using the returned battery. Add event listeners const handleChange = () => { setBatteryStatus({ charging: battery!.charging, level: battery!.level, chargingTime: battery!.chargingTime, dischargingTime: battery!.dischargingTime }); } battery.addEventListener(\"chargingchange\", handleChange); battery.addEventListener(\"levelchange\", handleChange); battery.addEventListener(\"chargingtimechange\", handleChange); battery.addEventListener(\"dischargingtimechange\", handleChange); In this case we are just checking for the events that are supported by the Battery Status API. It's very simple, we are just updating the data if something has changed. Of course, we also need to remove the event listeners when returning the useEffect hook. The link to the whole code can be found at the end of the post. That is all the magic we need to do. Yeah, pretty easy I would say. But it makes the whole functionality for the Battery Status API easy to access for React developers. Use the Hook After describing what needs to be done to create the hook, we will now have a look how we can install it. npm install @nikadev/use-battery-status --save # or yarn add @nikadev/use-battery-status Inside your app/component the code looks like this: import { useBatteryStatus } from \"@nikadev/use-battery-status\"; export function Component() { const { level, charging, chargingTime, dischargingTime, isSupported } = useBatteryStatus(); if(!isSupported) { return ( Battery Status API is not supported in this browser.p> ) } return ( <> Battery Status APIh1> charging:span> {charging ? 'Yes' : 'No'}span> p> chargingTime:span> {chargingTime}{chargingTime !== Infinity ? 's' : null}span> p> dischargingTime:span> {dischargingTime}{dischargingTime !== Infinity ? 's' : null}span> p> level:span> {level * 100}%span> p> section> ) } Example You can explore an example in the repo itself useBatteryStatus GitHub or visit my Vercel Example Page. Conclusion We just explained and showed how the useBatteryStatus hook encapsulate the data and logic for the Web API and makes it easy to use the data inside React itself.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_3f4517d17083","title":"Hands on Battery Status API","content":"Hi everyone, it‚Äòs me again. So let‚Äòs move on, with what we have done before. Today I want to write about a cool and small API. The Battery Status API. What is the Battery Status API? The API gives you the possibility to get the battery level of your device. Besides this you can also get information about the charging status and some more detailed information about the charging and discharching time. It's just as simple as that. Why should I use the Battery Status API To be honest, it's not something that will be used by every web application. But you can use it for energy-efficient features (like reduce animations or pause background sync) depending on the battery status. There is also a use case when you like to recommend something to the user when he is low on battery like: enable dark mode or disable live updates. But it could also be useful if you want to use it for device diagnostics. How can I use the Battery Status API As most of new Web API's the Battery Status API can be used by an asynchronous API that delivers a Promise. const battery = await navigator.getBattery(); This API call returns a BatteryManager object with the following properties: charging (boolean) chargingTime (number) dischargingTime (number) level (number) Let's go quickly through the properties. charging This is just a boolean which indicates if the device is connected to a power source. On desktops with no battery, browsers should always return true. But in some occasions they could also return false. For typical mobile devices (laptop or smartphones) it should work as expected. chargingTime This is a number in seconds which tells you the estimated time that your device need to fully charge the device. It could take some time until the the value is estimated by your device. If the time is not calculated it could return Infinity for mobile devices and can change later on. For desktop devices it will always return Infinity. dischargingTime The same as before, but it tells you the estimated time until your device reaches the empty battery state. level This is a number that shows you the current battery status level. The number is between 0 and 1. For 50% it would be 0.5. events There are also multiple events that you can listen to: chargingchange levelchange chargingtimechange dischargingtimechange These events will be triggered whenever one of those values changed. So nothing really special. Let's see the stuff in action. Everything in action Okay, sounds easy so far. And yes, the code looks also quite easy: async function initialize() { if(!navigator.getBattery) { console.warn(\"The Battery Status API is not supported in your browser.\"); return; } const battery = await navigator.getBattery(); // event listeners battery.addEventListener(\"chargingchange\", () => { console.log(`Battery charging? ${battery.charging ? \"Yes\" : \"No\"}`); }); battery.addEventListener(\"levelchange\", () => { console.log(`Battery level: ${battery.level * 100}%`); }); battery.addEventListener(\"chargingtimechange\", () => { console.log(`Battery charging time: ${battery.chargingTime} seconds`); }); battery.addEventListener(\"dischargingtimechange\", () => { console.log(`Battery discharging time: ${battery.dischargingTime} seconds`); }); } // call the async function for initialization initialize(); For testing purpose you could just copy this code into your browser. If you then plugin in/off your power supply and the browser is supporting the API you will see a console.log update in the Dev Tools. Which Browsers support the Web Battery Status API? I don't want to talk about it in detail, because it could be outdated. So here is the link to Web Battery Status API support. Conclusion As I said before the feature is small and is easy to use. So there is no excuse to not use it when it is useful for your application. Unfortunately the feature is currently (as I write this post here) not supported by all major browsers, but as all new Browser APIs you can add progressive support for the feature. Did you already use it inside your project? Let me know in the comment section if you already used it or give it a try in the next project. React usage You are reading this and want to use it inside your react application? I already created a small hook where you can use this API in the best react way possible.
