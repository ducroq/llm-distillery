We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax function, which creates \"Artificial Certainty\" by collapsing ambiguous attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer, which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based on evidential theory. CAM produces a \"credal set\" (a set of distributions) instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution, representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a foundation for more reliable AI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12137","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.300182","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Shihao Ji, Zihui Song, Jiajie Huang","raw_content_length":1297,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Credal Transformer","CAM","the Credal Transformer","Dirichlet","Transformer"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1296,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Credal Transformer","A Principled Approach","Quantifying","Mitigating Hallucinations","Large Language Models","which","arXiv251012137v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models LLMs hallucinate","factually incorrect yet confident assertions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","Large Language Models LLMs hallucinate"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Credal Transformer":2.0,"A Principled Approach":2.0,"Quantifying":2.0,"Mitigating Hallucinations":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251012137v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models LLMs hallucinate":1.0,"factually incorrect yet confident assertions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7394035561111107,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.844,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0397,"sadness":0.0085,"fear":0.046,"anger":0.0336,"disgust":0.0224},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new architecture (Credal Transformer) to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. While it quantifies ambiguity and reduces confident errors on unanswerable questions, it is still in the basic research phase with no deployed units or real-world data on climate impact.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_862764c73cc3","title":"Graph Few","content":"arXiv:2510.12140v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods, several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However, under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically, GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of experimental settings.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6c7fad2f2d98","title":"Fairness","content":"arXiv:2510.12143v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\\%, even in the presence of a single malicious client in the FL system.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12143","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.301381","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscr","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Harsh Kasyap, Minghong Fang, Zhuqing Liu, Carsten Maple, Somanath Tripathy","raw_content_length":1292,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fairness arXiv:2510.12143v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1291,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fairness","participants","arXiv251012143v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Federated learning","a privacy-preserving machine learning technique","collaboration","demographics","model sharing","the movement"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fairness","a privacy-preserving machine learning technique"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fairness":2.0,"participants":2.0,"arXiv251012143v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Federated learning":1.0,"a privacy-preserving machine learning technique":1.0,"collaboration":1.0,"demographics":1.0,"model sharing":1.0,"the movement":1.0}},"age_hours":2.739447179444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0775000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7845,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5607,"joy":0.0114,"surprise":0.0071,"sadness":0.0172,"fear":0.0611,"anger":0.1539,"disgust":0.1886},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on a theoretical attack on federated learning systems, demonstrating how a malicious client can inject bias.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3a55ff9398fe","title":"Budget","content":"arXiv:2510.12144v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset. Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right) censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from (3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several benchmarks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12144","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.301823","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Ali Parsaee, Bei Jiang, Zachary Friggstad, Russell Greiner","raw_content_length":1575,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1574,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Budget","a model","which","arXiv251012144v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Standard supervised learners","a labeled dataset","a small set","labeled instances","unlabeled instances"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Budget":2.0,"a model":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251012144v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Standard supervised learners":1.0,"a labeled dataset":1.0,"a small set":1.0,"labeled instances":1.0,"unlabeled instances":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7394648911111115,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.5305,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9368,"joy":0.0171,"surprise":0.0276,"sadness":0.0028,"fear":0.0022,"anger":0.0083,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel approach to budgeted learning for survival datasets, focusing on improving data collection efficiency.

Twenty participants of varying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The results showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for both groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in the traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar completion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion rate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced cognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the System Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and worthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional CAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities, while many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development, education, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for future research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on high-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes.

To this end, existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool, alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency.

Existing solutions enforce an all or nothing choice between full anonymity and mandatory identity disclosure, which limits adoption in regulated financial settings. We present VeilAudit, a cross chain auditing framework that introduces Auditor Only Linkability, which allows auditors to link transaction behaviors that originate from the same anonymous entity without learning its identity. VeilAudit achieves this with a user generated Linkable Audit Tag that embeds a zero knowledge proof to attest to its validity without exposing the user master wallet address, and with a special ciphertext that only designated auditors can test for linkage. To balance privacy and compliance, VeilAudit also supports threshold gated identity revelation under due process.

Despite growing interest in Natural Language Interaction (NLI) for visual analytics in immersive environments, users' speech patterns and their use of embodiment cues in speech remain underexplored. Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the gap between users' intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured speech input uncertainty for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how uncertain users' speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data analysis tasks, phases, and embodiment reliance driven by the counts and types of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12156","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.304274","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Hyemi Song, Matthew Johnson, Kirsten Whitley, Eric Krokos, Amitabh Varshney","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Natural Language Interaction","Immersive Analytics arXiv:2510.12156v1 Announce Type","NLI","Embodied Natural Language Interaction"],"persons":["Speech Input Patterns"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["NLI","Embodied Natural Language Interaction","Speech Input Patterns","Immersive Analytics","arXiv251012156v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Embodiment","users","intent","data"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"NLI":3.0,"Embodied Natural Language Interaction":2.0,"Speech Input Patterns":2.0,"Immersive Analytics":2.0,"arXiv251012156v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Embodiment":1.0,"users":1.0,"intent":1.0,"data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7395507530555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.2524999999999995,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2505,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.892,"joy":0.0077,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0227,"anger":0.0164,"disgust":0.0299},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores speech input patterns in immersive analytics, focusing on how users verbally express intent.

In the general model, the goal is to allocate $m$ indivisible items to $n$ agents while satisfying fairness criteria such as MMS, EF1, and EFX. We also study a recently-introduced graphical model that represents the fair division problem as a multigraph, in which vertices correspond to agents and edges to items. The graphical model stipulates that an item can have non-zero marginal utility to an agent only if its corresponding edge is incident to the agent's corresponding vertex. We study orientations (allocations that allocate each edge to an endpoint) in this model, as they are particularly desirable. Our first contribution concerns MMS allocations of mixed manna (i.e. a mixture of goods and chores) in the general model. It is known that MMS allocations of goods exist when $m \\leq n+5$. We generalize this and show that when $m \\leq n+5$, MMS allocations of mixed manna exist as long as $n \\leq 3$, there is an agent whose MMS threshold is non-negative, or every item is a chore. Remarkably, our result leaves only the case where every agent has a negative MMS threshold unanswered. Our second contribution concerns EFX orientations of multigraphs of goods. We show that deciding whether EFX orientations exist for multigraphs is NP-complete, even for symmetric bi-valued multigraphs. Complementarily, we show symmetric bi-valued multigraphs that do not contain non-trivial odd multitrees have EFX orientations that can be found in polynomial time. Our third contribution concerns EF1 and EFX orientations of graphs and multigraphs of chores. We obtain polynomial-time algorithms for deciding whether such graphs have EF1 and EFX orientations, resolving a previous conjecture and showing a fundamental difference between goods and chores division. In addition, we show that the analogous problems for multigraphs are NP-hard.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12158","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.305136","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csgt","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":300,"author":"Kevin Hsu","raw_content_length":1942,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.5,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EFX","MMS","Fair Division of","EF1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1935,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fair Division","Indivisible Items","arXiv251012158v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the fair division","indivisible items","the general model","the goal","m indivisible items","n agents"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fair Division"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fair Division":2.0,"Indivisible Items":2.0,"arXiv251012158v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the fair division":1.0,"indivisible items":1.0,"the general model":1.0,"the goal":1.0,"m indivisible items":1.0,"n agents":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7395811166666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9017,"joy":0.0286,"surprise":0.0453,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.002,"anger":0.0113,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores theoretical algorithms for fair allocation of resources, including chores, which could potentially be applied to resource management in sustainable systems.

Traditional prototype-based methods rely on deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization. This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics, and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12159","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.305540","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Ziyuan Gao, Philippe Morel","raw_content_length":1717,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DPL","Diffusion Prototype Learning"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1716,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DPL","Spatial","arXiv251012159v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","One-shot medical image segmentation","fundamental challenges","prototype representation","limited annotated data","significant anatomical variability","patients"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DPL":3.0,"Spatial":2.0,"arXiv251012159v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"One-shot medical image segmentation":1.0,"fundamental challenges":1.0,"prototype representation":1.0,"limited annotated data":1.0,"significant anatomical variability":1.0,"patients":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7395952250000004,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7951,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.0342,"sadness":0.0189,"fear":0.087,"anger":0.0354,"disgust":0.0253},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (DPL) for medical image segmentation, demonstrating improved performance on abdominal MRI and CT datasets.

To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.305974","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Jiahuan Zhou, Kai Zhu, Zhenyu Cui, Zichen Liu, Xu Zou, Gang Hua","raw_content_length":1713,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SSP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1712,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gathering","Spreading Spatio","arXiv251012160v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","pre-trained state space models","great potential","video classification","which","visual tokens"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["pre-trained state space models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gathering":2.0,"Spreading Spatio":2.0,"arXiv251012160v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"pre-trained state space models":1.0,"great potential":1.0,"video classification":1.0,"which":1.0,"visual tokens":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7396095241666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.662500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9325,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8825,"joy":0.0534,"surprise":0.0319,"sadness":0.0034,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0169,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (SSP) for video understanding that improves processing efficiency and performance.

This paper investigates whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning (essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\\footnote{Our code and data will be publicly available.}","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12167","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.307256","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Minghan Wang, Thuy-Trang Vu, Ehsan Shareghi, Gholamreza Haffari","raw_content_length":1691,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ORM","Outcome-Reward Model","PRM","COCONUT"],"persons":["Hao et al"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1690,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Inference","arXiv251012167v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Inference-time scaling","multiple sample generation","combination","Process-","Outcome-Reward Model","PRM","ORM"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["ORM"],"business_innovation":["ORM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Inference":2.0,"arXiv251012167v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Inference-time scaling":1.0,"multiple sample generation":1.0,"combination":1.0,"Process-":1.0,"Outcome-Reward Model":1.0,"PRM":1.0,"ORM":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7396503519444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9084,"joy":0.0231,"surprise":0.0322,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0097,"anger":0.0128,"disgust":0.0082},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores improving reasoning in continuous space using large language models.

To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks, analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the influence of retrieval-augmented generation.

Because of their resource and scalability requirements, many of these systems run on the cloud, which is considered untrusted. Existing works on securing databases on the cloud focus on protecting the data, and most systems leverage trusted hardware for high performance. However, in stream processing systems, queries are as sensitive as the data because they contain the application logics. We demonstrate that it is practical to extract the queries from stream processing systems that use Intel SGX for securing the execution engine. The attack performed by a malicious cloud provider is based on timing side channels, and it works in two phases. In the offline phase, the attacker profiles the execution time of individual stream operators, based on synthetic data. This phase outputs a model that identifies individual stream operators. In the online phase, the attacker isolates the operators that make up the query, monitors its execution, and recovers the operators using the model in the previous phase. We implement the attack based on popular data stream benchmarks using SecureStream and NEXMark, and demonstrate attack success rates of up to 92%. We further discuss approaches that can harden streaming processing systems against our attacks without incurring high overhead.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12172","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.308519","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Hung Pham, Viet Vo, Tien Tuan Anh Dinh, Duc Tran, Shuhao Zhang","raw_content_length":1474,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Leaking Queries On Secure Stream Processing Systems","Intel"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1471,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Queries","Secure Stream Processing Systems","which","arXiv251012172v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Stream processing systems","modern applications","data","real time","their resource and scalability requirements"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Queries":2.0,"Secure Stream Processing Systems":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251012172v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Stream processing systems":1.0,"modern applications":1.0,"data":1.0,"real time":1.0,"their resource and scalability requirements":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7396963961111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.172,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8344,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9333,"joy":0.0062,"surprise":0.0354,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0052,"anger":0.0097,"disgust":0.0068},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on security vulnerabilities in stream processing systems, specifically the ability to extract queries using timing side channels.

We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this \"control gap\" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9dd75940d0d9","title":"From Knowledge to Treatment: Large Language Model Assisted Biomedical Concept Representation for Drug Repurposing","content":"arXiv:2510.12181v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery, especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models (LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its robustness and effectiveness.

To mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage. However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12182","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.311506","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Youngju Yoo, Seho Kim, Changick Kim","raw_content_length":1668,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1667,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["BEEP3D","Box-Supervised End","arXiv251012182v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","3D instance segmentation","complex 3D environments","fully supervised methods","dense point-level annotations","substantial annotation costs","labor"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"BEEP3D":2.0,"Box-Supervised End":2.0,"arXiv251012182v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"3D instance segmentation":1.0,"complex 3D environments":1.0,"fully supervised methods":1.0,"dense point-level annotations":1.0,"substantial annotation costs":1.0,"labor":1.0}},"age_hours":2.739772710833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.297,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1406,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.893,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0072,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0351,"anger":0.024,"disgust":0.0286},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (BEEP3D) for 3D instance segmentation using box-level annotations, which could reduce annotation costs.

In this regard, the knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative, which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12184","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.311993","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Jiwan Kim, Kibum Kim, Sangwoo Seo, Chanyoung Park","raw_content_length":1393,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CompoDistill"],"persons":["Announce Type","Multimodal Large Language Models"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1392,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CompoDistill","Attention Distillation","Compositional Reasoning","Multimodal LLMs","arXiv251012184v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","efficient Multimodal Large Language Models","MLLMs","significant attention","a solution"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal LLMs","efficient Multimodal Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CompoDistill":2.0,"Attention Distillation":2.0,"Compositional Reasoning":2.0,"Multimodal LLMs":2.0,"arXiv251012184v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"efficient Multimodal Large Language Models":1.0,"MLLMs":1.0,"significant attention":1.0,"a solution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.73978758,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.65,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.93,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7536,"joy":0.1037,"surprise":0.0387,"sadness":0.0041,"fear":0.0422,"anger":0.0358,"disgust":0.0219},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation framework (CompoDistill) to improve the visual perception abilities of smaller multimodal language models.

We present the first systematic study of temporal bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For example, when asked \"At which second does the lecturer introduce the key formula?\", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization framework.

Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%.

Following the idea of the convolution approach, the diffusion-wave model is first transformed into an equivalent formulation. A fully discrete scheme is then developed by applying a compact difference approximation in space and combining the averaged product integration rule with linear interpolation quadrature in time. An efficient high-order two-grid algorithm is constructed by solving a small-scale nonlinear system on the coarse grid and a large-scale linearized system on the fine grid, where the bicubic spline interpolation operator is used to project coarse-grid solutions to the fine grid. Under mild assumptions on the variable exponent $\\alpha(t)$, the stability and convergence of the STG compact difference scheme are rigorously established.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6aa9c90de7ed","title":"Agent","content":"arXiv:2510.12189v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In real-world stock markets, certain chart patterns -- such as price declines near historical highs -- cannot be fully explained by fundamentals alone. These phenomena suggest the presence of path dependence in price formation, where investor decisions are influenced not only by current market conditions but also by the trajectory of prices leading up to the present. Path dependence has drawn attention in behavioral finance as a key mechanism behind such anomalies. One plausible driver of path dependence is human loss aversion, anchored to individual reference points like purchase prices or past peaks, which vary with personal context. However, capturing such subtle behavioral tendencies in traditional agent-based market simulations has remained a challenge. We propose the Fundamental-Chartist-LLM-Agent (FCLAgent), which uses large language models (LLMs) to emulate human-like trading decisions.

The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_10fa0fb79b04","title":"SDGraph: Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.12192v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Freehand sketches exhibit unique sparsity and abstraction, necessitating learning pipelines distinct from those designed for images. For sketch learning methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels: sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine (point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\\% and 1.70\\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively, and 36.58\\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12192","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.314424","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","csgr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Xi Cheng, Pingfa Feng, Zhichao Liao, Mingyu Fan, Long Zeng","raw_content_length":1933,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Multi-Level Sketch Representation Scheme"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1932,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SDGraph","Multi","arXiv251012192v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Freehand sketches","unique sparsity","abstraction","necessitating","pipelines","those"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SDGraph":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251012192v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Freehand sketches":1.0,"unique sparsity":1.0,"abstraction":1.0,"necessitating":1.0,"pipelines":1.0,"those":1.0}},"age_hours":2.739878735833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.282499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6565,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8907,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.0295,"sadness":0.0117,"fear":0.0144,"anger":0.0296,"disgust":0.0145},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture (SDGraph) for sketch recognition.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_7f72074f04be","title":"DPO","content":"arXiv:2510.12195v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2 as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct comparison.

Recent developments in GPU hardware, including larger L1 memory per Streaming Multiprocessor/Compute Unit, have changed that. We present the first GPU algorithm for reducing a banded matrix to bidiagonal form as part of the NextLA.jl open-source software package. Our algorithm is based on previous CPU-based multicore parallel cache-efficient bulge chasing algorithms and adapted to optimize for GPU throughput. We leverage Julia Language's Array abstractions and KernelAbstractions to implement a single hardware- and data precision-agnostic function on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple Metal GPUs for half, single, and double precision, and examine performance optimization across hardware architectures and data precision. We also develop a hardware-aware performance model and identify key hyperparameters, such as inner tilewidth and block concurrency, that govern optimal GPU execution for bandwidth-bound workloads. We demonstrate highly parallel bandwidth-bound algorithm on the GPU can outperform CPU-based implementations: the GPU algorithm outperforms multithreaded CPU High-Performance libraries PLASMA and SLATE as of matrix size 1024 x 1024 and by a factor over 100 for matrices of 32k x 32k. In addition, the performance of the algorithm increases linearly with matrix bandwidth size, making faster reduction of larger matrix bandwidths now also possible.

Traditional penetration testing is costly and expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet, their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling.

Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users. Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation, which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability, interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices, the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12201","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.317887","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Aline Mangold, Juliane Zietz, Susanne Weinhold, Sebastian Pannasch","raw_content_length":1851,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Design and Evaluation of Human arXiv:2510.12201v1 Announce"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1850,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Design","Evaluation","Human","human users","arXiv251012201v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","everyday living","an increasing demand","intelligent systems","performant"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Design":2.0,"Evaluation":2.0,"Human":2.0,"human users":2.0,"arXiv251012201v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"everyday living":1.0,"an increasing demand":1.0,"intelligent systems":1.0,"performant":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7399533263888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.406499999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0813,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8686,"joy":0.0066,"surprise":0.0283,"sadness":0.0268,"fear":0.0205,"anger":0.0264,"disgust":0.0228},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper reviews user studies of XAI systems, aiming to improve human-centered design.

The slumber or sleep may be caused by huge stress, pressure, relentless work load or alcoholism, for which sleep deprivation occurs and the chauffeur while driving gets drowsy. So far, considerable amount of systems has been developed to detect drowsiness of drivers, most of which mainly depend on image processing algorithms using cameras.

Therefore, the community has been focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However, controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA) remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different collision scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12206","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.318687","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cslg","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Pin-Lun Chen, Chi-Hsi Kung, Che-Han Chang, Wei-Chen Chiu, Yi-Ting Chen","raw_content_length":1567,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COLLIDE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1566,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Controllable Collision Scenario Generation","Collision Pattern Prediction","arXiv251012206v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the safety","autonomous vehicles","AVs","diverse safety-critical scenarios","collisions","the real world"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Controllable Collision Scenario Generation":2.0,"Collision Pattern Prediction":2.0,"arXiv251012206v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the safety":1.0,"autonomous vehicles":1.0,"AVs":1.0,"diverse safety-critical scenarios":1.0,"collisions":1.0,"the real world":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7399832755555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1355000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5729,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7322,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0175,"sadness":0.0095,"fear":0.2111,"anger":0.0159,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new method for generating collision scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing, using a dataset constructed from real-world driving logs.

Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning, which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only, specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.

Meta-learning-based sample reweighting mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12209","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.319479","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Yiming Zhang, Chester Holtz, Gal Mishne, Alex Cloninger","raw_content_length":1449,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Revisiting Meta arXiv:2510.12209v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1448,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Meta","arXiv251012209v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","noisy labels","over-parameterized networks","corrupted supervision","Meta-learning-based sample reweighting mitigates","a small clean subset","training","theoretical understanding"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["training"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Meta":2.0,"arXiv251012209v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"noisy labels":1.0,"over-parameterized networks":1.0,"corrupted supervision":1.0,"Meta-learning-based sample reweighting mitigates":1.0,"a small clean subset":1.0,"training":1.0,"theoretical understanding":1.0}},"age_hours":2.740014016111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8733,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0358,"sadness":0.011,"fear":0.0244,"anger":0.0222,"disgust":0.0237},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical analysis and a proposed method for improving machine learning with noisy labels.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8b86547aa09e","title":"Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation","content":"arXiv:2510.12211v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However, applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision.

Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly across different backbone families and scales.

ETSC can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens, and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets.

HALF organizes nine application domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline. Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision support but worse in education.

However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution. Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT, which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting. GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks. In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this setting.

Accurately recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network, and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based approaches.

While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \\textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.322512","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Hanru Bai, Weiyang Ding, Difan Zou","raw_content_length":1660,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":["Koopman Diffusion","Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1659,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion","Fast Generation","Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory","arXiv251012220v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Diffusion models","impressive success","high-fidelity image generation","slow sampling","their inherently iterative denoising process"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion":2.0,"Fast Generation":2.0,"Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory":2.0,"arXiv251012220v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Diffusion models":1.0,"impressive success":1.0,"high-fidelity image generation":1.0,"slow sampling":1.0,"their inherently iterative denoising process":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7401202566666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.8235,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5647,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8405,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0316,"sadness":0.057,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0342},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for improving the efficiency of image generation using diffusion models.

Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2) an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained, task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual support and domain-specific applicability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12224","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.322956","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Yuechun Yu, Han Ying, Haoan Jin, Wenjian Jiang, Dong Xian, Binghao Wang, Zhou Yang, Mengyue Wu","raw_content_length":1795,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1794,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MedKGEval","A Knowledge Graph-Based Multi","arXiv251012224v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The reliable evaluation","large language models","LLMs","medical applications","an open challenge","the complexity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MedKGEval":2.0,"A Knowledge Graph-Based Multi":2.0,"arXiv251012224v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The reliable evaluation":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"medical applications":1.0,"an open challenge":1.0,"the complexity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.740134833611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8666,"joy":0.0137,"surprise":0.0756,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0145,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel evaluation framework (MedKGEval) for clinical LLMs, using a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation.

However, the principles underlying the construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c) scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse. Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12225","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.323368","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cslg","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Hritik Bansal, Devandra Singh Sachan, Kai-Wei Chang, Aditya Grover, Gargi Ghosh, Wen-tau Yih, Ramakanth Pasunuru","raw_content_length":1607,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HoneyBee","CoT","VLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1606,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HoneyBee","Data Recipes","Vision","new Abstract","Recent advances","vision-language models","VLMs","them","reasoning tasks","the principles"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Vision"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HoneyBee":2.0,"Data Recipes":2.0,"Vision":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"vision-language models":1.0,"VLMs":1.0,"them":1.0,"reasoning tasks":1.0,"the principles":1.0}},"age_hours":2.740150020555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5445,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7089,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9115,"joy":0.0163,"surprise":0.0263,"sadness":0.0088,"fear":0.0072,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0126},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new dataset (HoneyBee) and data curation strategies to improve vision-language models (VLMs).

A key challenge in this field is improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step, reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements across both modalities.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12231","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.324170","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Victor Besnier, David Hurych, Andrei Bursuc, Eduardo Valle","raw_content_length":1457,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Token Fixing"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1456,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["BIGFix","Bidirectional Image Generation","Token Fixing","Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","image","video generation","significant interest","both academia"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["both academia"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"BIGFix":2.0,"Bidirectional Image Generation":2.0,"Token Fixing":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"image":1.0,"video generation":1.0,"significant interest":1.0,"both academia":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7401797608333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.568,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9136,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7221,"joy":0.1435,"surprise":0.0846,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0221,"anger":0.0159,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the efficiency of image and video generation models, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption associated with training and using these models.

Fine-grained complexity results show that on worst-case inputs, any significant improvement over the naive brute-force algorithm is unlikely, as this would refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Nevertheless, a recent work by Dransfeld et al. (ESA 2025) reveals some significant improvement potential particularly in \\emph{sparse} graphs. We ask: Can algorithms with conditionally almost-optimal worst-case performance solve the Dominating $H$-Pattern, for selected patterns $H$, efficiently on practical inputs? We develop and experimentally evaluate several approaches on a large benchmark of diverse datasets, including baseline approaches using the Glasgow Subgraph Solver (GSS), the SAT solver Kissat, and the ILP solver Gurobi.

By integrating large language models (LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs, offering valuable insights for improving their resilience.

While HCI research often analyzes problematic behaviors with pieces of user-generated content as the unit of analysis, less attention has been given to event-focused perspectives that track how discrete events evolve. In this paper, we examine 'social media crises': discrete patterns of problematic behaviors originating and evolving within social media that cause larger-scale harms. Using global news coverage, we present a dataset of 93,250 news articles covering social media-endemic crises from the past 20 years. We analyze a representative subset to classify stakeholder roles, behavior types, and outcomes, uncovering patterns that inform more nuanced classification of social media crises beyond content-based descriptions. By adopting a wider perspective, this research seeks to inform the design of safer platforms, enabling proactive measures to mitigate crises and foster more trustworthy online environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12243","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.325841","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cshc","computer-science","cssi","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Jeanne Choi, DongJae Kang, Yubin Choi, Juhoon Lee, Joseph Seering","raw_content_length":1141,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CrisisNews"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1140,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CrisisNews","A Dataset Mapping Two Decades","News Articles","Online Problematic Behavior","Scale","arXiv251012243v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","social media adoption","online problematic behaviors","large-scale crises"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CrisisNews":2.0,"A Dataset Mapping Two Decades":2.0,"News Articles":2.0,"Online Problematic Behavior":2.0,"Scale":2.0,"arXiv251012243v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"social media adoption":1.0,"online problematic behaviors":1.0,"large-scale crises":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7402418330555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.8645000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8271,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7631,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0666,"sadness":0.0125,"fear":0.1153,"anger":0.0271,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes a dataset of news articles related to social media crises.
