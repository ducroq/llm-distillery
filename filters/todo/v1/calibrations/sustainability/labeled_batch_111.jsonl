Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\\% and 4.53\\% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

One drawback with existing models is that they lack structural cohesion, particularly on harmonic-melodic structure. Furthermore, such existing models are largely \"black-box\" in nature and are not musically interpretable. This paper addresses these limitations via a novel generative music framework that incorporates concepts of Schenkerian analysis (SchA) in concert with a diffusion modeling framework. This framework, which we call ProGress (Prolongation-enhanced DiGress), adapts state-of-the-art deep models for discrete diffusion (in particular, the DiGress model of Vignac et al., 2023) for interpretable and structured music generation. Concretely, our contributions include 1) novel adaptations of the DiGress model for music generation, 2) a novel SchA-inspired phrase fusion methodology, and 3) a framework allowing users to control various aspects of the generation process to create coherent musical compositions.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_683f1f3132c8","title":"Are Video Models Emerging as Zero","content":"arXiv:2510.10254v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan, producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on 4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation models built on video models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10254","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.675976","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Yuxiang Lai, Jike Zhong, Ming Li, Yuheng Li, Xiaofeng Yang","raw_content_length":1654,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Are Video Models Emerging","LVM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1653,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Video Models","arXiv251010254v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","large generative models","that simple autoregressive formulations","strong zero-shot generalization","domains","this trend","autoregressive video modeling principles"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["domains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Video Models":2.0,"arXiv251010254v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"large generative models":1.0,"that simple autoregressive formulations":1.0,"strong zero-shot generalization":1.0,"domains":1.0,"this trend":1.0,"autoregressive video modeling principles":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749712799444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8261,"joy":0.0125,"surprise":0.0252,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0579,"anger":0.0402,"disgust":0.0345},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a large vision model (LVM) applied to medical imaging tasks, demonstrating zero-shot capabilities in organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction.

As discretizations refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free, non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models, integrated with the IPC barrier.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10256","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.676374","language":"en","tags":["research","csgr","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Gonzalo Gomez-Nogales, Zhen Chen, Rosalie Martin, Elena Garces, Danny M.

While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%.

To achieve decent and efficient solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size. Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for generalizability enhancement.

To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and natural gesture transitions.

Serving as metadata of training data, these tokens play a crucial role in instructing LLMs to generate coherent and context-aware responses. We demonstrate that special tokens can be exploited to construct four attack primitives, with which malicious users can reliably bypass the internal safety alignment of online LLM services and circumvent state-of-the-art (SOTA) external content moderation systems simultaneously. Moreover, we found that addressing this threat is challenging, as aggressive defense mechanisms-such as input sanitization by removing special tokens entirely, as suggested in academia-are less effective than anticipated. This is because such defense can be evaded when the special tokens are replaced by regular ones with high semantic similarity within the tokenizer's embedding space. We systemically evaluated our method, named MetaBreak, on both lab environment and commercial LLM platforms. Our approach achieves jailbreak rates comparable to SOTA prompt-engineering-based solutions when no content moderation is deployed. However, when there is content moderation, MetaBreak outperforms SOTA solutions PAP and GPTFuzzer by 11.6% and 34.8%, respectively. Finally, since MetaBreak employs a fundamentally different strategy from prompt engineering, the two approaches can work synergistically. Notably, empowering MetaBreak on PAP and GPTFuzzer boosts jailbreak rates by 24.3% and 20.2%, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10271","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.679380","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Wentian Zhu, Zhen Xiang, Wei Niu, Le Guan","raw_content_length":1675,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models","LLM","MetaBreak"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1674,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MetaBreak","Jailbreaking Online LLM Services","Special Token Manipulation","special tokens","LLMs","arXiv251010271v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","regular tokens","existing text corpora","structured conversations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Jailbreaking Online LLM Services"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MetaBreak":2.0,"Jailbreaking Online LLM Services":2.0,"Special Token Manipulation":2.0,"special tokens":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv251010271v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"regular tokens":1.0,"existing text corpora":1.0,"structured conversations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7498354869444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.259500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8519,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7787,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0241,"sadness":0.0106,"fear":0.0372,"anger":0.0842,"disgust":0.0588},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method to jailbreak LLMs, which could indirectly impact sustainability by affecting the reliability of information generated by these models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6e759f7900d3","title":"Lost in the Middle: An Emergent Property from Information Retrieval Demands in LLMs","content":"arXiv:2510.10276v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial information is in the middle of a long context, a \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information (a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce positional bias observed in LLMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10276","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.680660","language":"en","tags":["cslg","preprints","research","q-bionc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Nikolaus Salvatore, Hao Wang, Qiong Zhang","raw_content_length":1509,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1508,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","the Middle","Information Retrieval Demands","new Abstract","The performance","Large Language Models","crucial information","the middle","a long context","a lost-in-the-middle phenomenon"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"the Middle":2.0,"Information Retrieval Demands":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The performance":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"crucial information":1.0,"the middle":1.0,"a long context":1.0,"a lost-in-the-middle phenomenon":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7498823602777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.4065,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5187,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7862,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.1011,"sadness":0.0227,"fear":0.0129,"anger":0.0286,"disgust":0.0443},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the 'lost-in-the-middle' phenomenon in LLMs and proposes it's an adaptation to different information retrieval demands.

In contrast, current medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training, requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1) fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3) premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10278","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.681093","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Christopher Chiu, Silviu Pitis, Mihaela van der Schaar","raw_content_length":1872,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VivaBench","LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1871,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Simulating Viva Voce Examinations","Clinical Reasoning","Large Language Models","arXiv251010278v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Clinical reasoning","medicine","a hypothesis-driven process","physicians","diagnoses"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"],"healthcare_tech":["medicine"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Simulating Viva Voce Examinations":2.0,"Clinical Reasoning":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251010278v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Clinical reasoning":1.0,"medicine":1.0,"a hypothesis-driven process":1.0,"physicians":1.0,"diagnoses":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7498967325000003,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8827,"joy":0.0081,"surprise":0.0538,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0159,"anger":0.0204,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a new benchmark (VivaBench) for evaluating clinical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting limitations in current AI systems.

However, the factors that give rise to such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks, and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10280","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.681507","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Yihong Liu, Mingyang Wang, Fran\\c{c}ois Yvon, Hinrich Sch\\\"utze","raw_content_length":1272,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SubInj","SubSub"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1271,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Entity","languages","arXiv251010280v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Multilingual large language models","LLMs","factual knowledge","the factors","rise","such crosslingual consistency"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multilingual large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Entity":2.0,"languages":2.0,"arXiv251010280v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multilingual large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"factual knowledge":1.0,"the factors":1.0,"rise":1.0,"such crosslingual consistency":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749911223611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8479,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.009,"fear":0.0706,"anger":0.0273,"disgust":0.0176},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the consistency of multilingual large language models (LLMs) in recalling factual knowledge.

Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks.

Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content. In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division: shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining. Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional computation and 9% of baseline latency.

To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer than 5\\% of the original trainable parameters.

Previous pulse shape optimisation has been limited to symmetric pulses or heavily constrained variations of conventional waveforms without achieving general optimality in energy efficiency or neural selectivity. We implemented an optimisation framework that incorporates neuron model activation constraints and flexible control of pulse asymmetry. The optimised electric field waveforms achieved up to 92 % and 88 % reduction in energy loss and thus coil heating respectively compared to conventional monophasic pulses and previously improved monophasic-equivalent pulses. In the human experiments, OUR pulses showed similar motor thresholds to monophasic pulses in both AP and PA directions with significantly lower energy loss, particularly in the AP direction. Moreover, there was a significant MEP latency difference of (1.79 +/- 0.41) ms between AP and PA direction with OUR pulses, which suggests directional selectivity. Our framework successfully identified highly energy-efficient asymmetric pulses for directionally-selective neural engagement. These pulses can enable selective rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols with reduced power consumption and coil heating, with potential benefits for precision and potency of neuro-modulation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10289","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.683992","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","q-bionc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Ke Ma, Andrey Vlasov, Zeynep B.

We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene.

This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \\emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \\emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\\varnothing$, i.e., \\[ \\Delta = K\\big(O_{W,\\varnothing}\\big) - K\\big(O_{W,R}\\big) > 0. \\] We then prove that the larger $\\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\\Delta > 0$ yields \\[ \\Pr\\big((W,R)\\mid x\\big) \\le C\\,2^{\\,M(W{:}R)}\\,2^{-\\Delta}, \\] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle.

While a number of existing LM agent architectures incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains, ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid, it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments through more effective utilization of past experiences.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10304","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.686511","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Michael Y.

Conventional accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily routines. In this study, we introduce a space-time accessibility (SPA) metric rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes, and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents in the Paris region, we assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure participation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations. Spatial patterns show that most individuals-especially active transport users-choose destinations aligned with their SPA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling reveals that SPA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity.

A Study of robots.txt Gatekeeping on the Web","content":"arXiv:2510.10315v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on web crawling to stay up to date and accurately answer user queries. These crawlers are expected to honor robots.txt files, which govern automated access. In this study, for the first time, we investigate whether reputable news websites and misinformation sites differ in how they configure these files, particularly in relation to AI crawlers. Analyzing a curated dataset, we find a stark contrast: 60.0% of reputable sites disallow at least one AI crawler, compared to just 9.1% of misinformation sites in their robots.txt files. Reputable sites forbid an average of 15.5 AI user agents, while misinformation sites prohibit fewer than one. We then measure active blocking behavior, where websites refuse to return content when HTTP requests include AI crawler user agents, and reveal that both categories of websites utilize it. Notably, the behavior of reputable news websites in this regard aligns more closely with their declared robots.txt directive than that of misinformation websites. Finally, our longitudinal analysis reveals that this gap has widened over time, with AI-blocking by reputable sites rising from 23% in September 2023 to nearly 60% by May 2025.

An important step in capacity management is predicting future resource needs often relies on data-driven analytics and machine learning (ML) forecasting models, which require frequent retraining to stay relevant as data evolves. Continuously retraining the forecasting models can be expensive and difficult to scale, posing a challenge for engineering teams tasked with balancing accuracy and efficiency. Retraining only when the data changes appears to be a more computationally efficient alternative, but its impact on accuracy requires further investigation. In this work, we investigate the effects of retraining capacity forecasting models for time series based on detected changes in the data compared to periodic retraining. Our results show that drift-based retraining achieves comparable forecasting accuracy to periodic retraining in most cases, making it a cost-effective strategy. However, in cases where data is changing rapidly, periodic retraining is still preferred to maximize the forecasting accuracy. These findings offer actionable insights for software teams to enhance forecasting systems, reducing retraining overhead while maintaining robust performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10320","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.688536","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Lorena Poenaru-Olaru, Wouter van 't Hof, Adrian Stando, Arkadiusz P.

Investigating the Influence of Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.10328v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However, emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture, and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10328","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.690143","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Ananya Malik, Nazanin Sabri, Melissa Karnaze, Mai Elsherief","raw_content_length":1338,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1337,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","All","the Influence","Multi","arXiv251010328v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models LLMs ability","their ability","their users","emotional experiences"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models LLMs ability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"All":2.0,"the Influence":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251010328v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models LLMs ability":1.0,"their ability":1.0,"their users":1.0,"emotional experiences":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7502229016666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.213000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8426,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9128,"joy":0.015,"surprise":0.0332,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.008,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the empathetic biases of LLMs across diverse user groups.

Specifically, we focus on the classic fairness notion of proportionality and efficiency notion of Pareto-optimality. Since proportional allocations may not always exist in this setting, we allow the use of subsidies (monetary compensation to agents) to ensure agents are proportionally-satisfied, and aim to minimize the total subsidy required. Wu and Zhou (WINE 2024) showed that when each chore has disutility at most 1, a total subsidy of at most $n/3 - 1/6$ is sufficient to guarantee proportionality. However, their approach is based on a complex technique, which does not guarantee economic efficiency - a key desideratum in fair division. In this work, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the same subsidy bound while also ensuring Pareto-optimality. Moreover, both our algorithm and its analysis are significantly simpler than those of Wu and Zhou (WINE 2024). Our approach first computes a proportionally-fair competitive equilibrium, and then applies a rounding procedure guided by minimum-pain-per-buck edges.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10335","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.691671","language":"en","tags":["research","csgt","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Jugal Garg, Eklavya Sharma, Xiaowei Wu","raw_content_length":1251,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Zhou"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1248,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Proportional","Pareto","agents","new Abstract","the problem","m indivisible chores","n agents","possibly different weights","a solution","the classic fairness notion"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the classic fairness notion"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Proportional":2.0,"Pareto":2.0,"agents":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"m indivisible chores":1.0,"n agents":1.0,"possibly different weights":1.0,"a solution":1.0,"the classic fairness notion":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750282652777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.329,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8658,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8857,"joy":0.0381,"surprise":0.0239,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.0335,"disgust":0.0105},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new algorithm for fair allocation of chores with subsidies, aiming to minimize the total subsidy required while ensuring Pareto-optimality.

To better understand the link between research inputs and outputs, we introduce FIND (Funding-Impact NSF Database), an open-access dataset that systematically links NSF grant proposals to their downstream research outputs, including publication metadata and abstracts. The primary contribution of this project is the creation of a large-scale, structured dataset that enables transparency, impact evaluation, and metascience research on the returns to public funding. To illustrate the potential of FIND, we present two proof-of-concept NLP applications.

While some automation exists, the field is now on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing, executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety. Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist. Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and AI-driven insight.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10337","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.692433","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Jihong Zhu, Kefeng Huang, Jonathon Pipe, Chris Horbaczewsky, Andy Tyrrell, Ian J.

This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries, we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects and data advantages accrue to early movers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10338","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.692865","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscy","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Balagopal Unnikrishnan, Ariel Guerra Adames, Amin Adibi, Sameer Peesapati, Rafal Kocielnik, Shira Fischer, Hillary Clinton Kasimbazi, Rodrigo Gameiro, Alina Peluso, Chrystinne Oliveira Fernandes, Maximin Lange, Lovedeep Gondara, Leo Anthony Celi","raw_content_length":1681,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["billion-dollar"]},"char_count":1680,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ethics","Inclusive Innovation","Economic Returns","Medical AI","arXiv251010338v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","ethical arguments","fairness","healthcare AI","the economic and strategic value"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["Inclusive Innovation"],"ai_ml":["Medical AI"],"healthcare_tech":["Medical AI"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ethics":2.0,"Inclusive Innovation":2.0,"Economic Returns":2.0,"Medical AI":2.0,"arXiv251010338v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"ethical arguments":1.0,"fairness":1.0,"healthcare AI":1.0,"the economic and strategic value":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750328015277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9001,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8395,"joy":0.0565,"surprise":0.0461,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0092,"anger":0.0278,"disgust":0.0159},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a framework (HAIIF) for evaluating AI investments based on inclusivity, suggesting it can drive economic returns.

These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways, without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness, transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level understanding.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10339","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.693259","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Shalaleh Rismani, Renee Shelby, Leah Davis, Negar Rostamzadeh, AJung Moon","raw_content_length":1366,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hazards"],"persons":["Harms arXiv:2510.10339v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1365,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["What Matters","AI Ethics Evaluations","System Attributes","Hazards","Harms","AI systems","arXiv251010339v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the past decade","an ecosystem"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI Ethics Evaluations"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"What Matters":2.0,"AI Ethics Evaluations":2.0,"System Attributes":2.0,"Hazards":2.0,"Harms":2.0,"AI systems":2.0,"arXiv251010339v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the past decade":1.0,"an ecosystem":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750344495555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4025,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1195,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8849,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0169,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0194,"anger":0.0353,"disgust":0.0335},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes existing AI ethics measures and their connection to AI system components, hazards, and harms.

Despite recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust, dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on 32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally, the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios, demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_87afd2be57c7","title":"Learning Operators through Coefficient Mappings in Fixed Basis Spaces","content":"arXiv:2510.10350v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for approximating solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs) and other functional mappings. \\textcolor{red}{}{Classical approaches} typically adopt a pointwise-to-pointwise framework, where input functions are sampled at prescribed locations and mapped directly to solution values. We propose the Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network (FB-C2CNet), which learns operators in the coefficient space induced by prescribed basis functions. In this framework, the input function is projected onto a fixed set of basis functions (e.g., random features or finite element bases), and the neural operator predicts the coefficients of the solution function in the same or another basis. By decoupling basis selection from network training, FB-C2CNet reduces training complexity, enables systematic analysis of how basis choice affects approximation accuracy, and clarifies what properties of coefficient spaces (such as effective rank and coefficient variations) are critical for generalization. Numerical experiments on Darcy flow, Poisson equations in regular, complex, and high-dimensional domains, and elasticity problems demonstrate that FB-C2CNet achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency, showing its strong potential for practical operator learning tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10350","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.695430","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Chuqi Chen, Yang Xiang, Weihong Zhang","raw_content_length":1399,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["\\textcolor{red}{}{Classical","the Fixed-Basis Coefficient to Coefficient Operator Network","Coefficient Mappings"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1398,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Learning Operators","Coefficient Mappings","Fixed Basis Spaces","arXiv251010350v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Operator learning","a powerful paradigm","approximating solution operators","partial differential equations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Learning Operators":2.0,"Coefficient Mappings":2.0,"Fixed Basis Spaces":2.0,"arXiv251010350v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Operator learning":1.0,"a powerful paradigm":1.0,"approximating solution operators":1.0,"partial differential equations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7504228683333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3445,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8689,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8946,"joy":0.0189,"surprise":0.0533,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0052,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (FB-C2CNet) for operator learning in PDEs, potentially improving the efficiency of simulations used in various fields, including climate modeling and engineering.

Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\\% inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction.

However, existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we introduce Adaptive $\\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10365","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.697437","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Linlian Jiang, Rui Ma, Li Gu, Ziqiang Wang, Xinxin Zuo, Yang Wang","raw_content_length":1569,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning","MAML","Meta arXiv:2510.10365v1 Announce Type","PointMAC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1568,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PointMAC","Meta","arXiv251010365v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Point cloud completion","robust 3D perception","safety-critical applications","robotics","augmented reality","existing models"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PointMAC":3.0,"Meta":2.0,"arXiv251010365v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Point cloud completion":1.0,"robust 3D perception":1.0,"safety-critical applications":1.0,"robotics":1.0,"augmented reality":1.0,"existing models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7504989275,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9082,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0351,"sadness":0.0099,"fear":0.0158,"anger":0.0149,"disgust":0.0089},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a meta-learning framework (PointMAC) for improving the robustness of point cloud completion, which is relevant to robotics and augmented reality.

Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact, surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks, notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations, such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other 2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six additional tasks.

This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions. First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side information with provable guarantees.

We propose \\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables. This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels, distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates, including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset, demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems, while preserving interpretability.

To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets, Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior, enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct scalable and cost-effective monitoring.

Optimizing the models' accuracies and training times in the MMFL setting requires adapting to data and system heterogeneity across clients as in single-model FL; these challenges are amplified in the MMFL setting due to additional heterogeneity across models. Neither existing solutions nor na\\\"ive extensions of single-model FL frameworks efficiently address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose FLAMMABLE, a comprehensive MMFL training framework. FLAMMABLE optimizes model training by intelligently adapting client batch sizes while engaging them to train multiple carefully chosen models, depending on their system capabilities, in each training round. To evaluate FLAMMABLE, we develop the first benchmark platform for the MMFL setting, which may enable future reproducible MMFL research. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets and models show that FLAMMABLE boosts the MMFL time-to-accuracy performance by 1.1$\\sim$10.0$\\times$ while improving the final model accuracy by 1.3$\\sim$5.4\\% compared to several known baselines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10380","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.699899","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","csdc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Shouxu Lin, Zimeng Pan, Yuhang Yao, Haeyoung Noh, Pei Zhang, Carlee Joe-Wong","raw_content_length":1261,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multi-Model Federated Learning","MMFL","FLAMMABLE","Federated Learning"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1260,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FLAMMABLE","Announce Type","new Abstract","Multi-Model Federated Learning","MMFL","an emerging direction","Federated Learning","multiple models","parallel","various datasets"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FLAMMABLE":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multi-Model Federated Learning":1.0,"MMFL":1.0,"an emerging direction":1.0,"Federated Learning":1.0,"multiple models":1.0,"parallel":1.0,"various datasets":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750593538888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8619,"joy":0.0158,"surprise":0.094,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.01,"disgust":0.0031},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel federated learning framework (FLAMMABLE) that optimizes model training.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6f486fe57e3c","title":"Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms","content":"arXiv:2510.10383v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box\", where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning, not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller, non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly, making classification more challenging. The second method involves the application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms, and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without the need to use background information.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.700341","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":281,"author":"Sai Teja Erukude","raw_content_length":1965,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.405,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1964,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["bias","CNN image classification","image scrambling","transforms","new Abstract","CNNs","the primary choice","most machine vision problems","their superior rate","classification"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"bias":2.0,"CNN image classification":2.0,"image scrambling":2.0,"transforms":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"CNNs":1.0,"the primary choice":1.0,"most machine vision problems":1.0,"their superior rate":1.0,"classification":1.0}},"age_hours":2.750609323888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.39,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.478,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9364,"joy":0.0154,"surprise":0.0322,"sadness":0.0021,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.0059,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores methods to identify biases in CNN image classification, which could indirectly support sustainability by improving the accuracy of AI systems used for environmental monitoring or resource management.
