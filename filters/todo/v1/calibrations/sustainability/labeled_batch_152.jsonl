{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f18f5849fa9f","title":"Post","content":"arXiv:2503.22776v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Code translation migrates codebases across programming languages. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22776","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:38:57.022049","language":"en","tags":["csai","preprints","computer-science","research","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Yali Du, Hui Sun, Ming Li","raw_content_length":1926,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","Post arXiv:2503.22776v2","Coverage of Abst","ICL"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1925,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","Abstract","Code translation","codebases","programming languages","large language models","LLMs","significant advancements","software mining","the syntactic structure"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["programming languages"],"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Code translation":1.0,"codebases":1.0,"programming languages":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"significant advancements":1.0,"software mining":1.0,"the syntactic structure":1.0}},"age_hours":14.751964318611112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.83,"joy":0.0081,"surprise":0.0108,"sadness":0.0336,"fear":0.0853,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0192},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for improving code translation using LLMs, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by improving the efficiency of software development for climate-related technologies.

The questionnaires measured social media usage frequency, social anxiety, FoMO, teacher-student relationships, and academic performance. Scale reliability and validity were first examined through confirmatory factor analysis, followed by structural equation modeling to assess chain mediation effects. The moderating effect of teacher-student relationships was tested using the PROCESS Model 14 framework.ResultsSocial media use had a significant negative direct effect on college students’ academic performance. Social anxiety and FoMO served as significant mediators in this relationship. Teacher-student relationships significantly moderated the negative effect of FoMO on academic performance.ConclusionHigh-frequency social media use among college students undermines academic performance through an emotional pathway whereby social anxiety leads to increased FoMO. Strong teacher-student relationships can function as an emotional regulatory mechanism, significantly reducing this adverse impact.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1649890","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:13.269911","language":"en","tags":["frontiers","open-access","original_research","psychology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Jinghao Tan","raw_content_length":1398,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ResultsSocial","FoMO","MethodsUsing"],"persons":["ObjectiveTo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1398,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["social anxiety","academic performance","college students","fear","Social media use","the chain mediating roles","the moderating effect","teacher","FoMO","the mechanisms"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["academic performance"],"ai_ml":["the chain mediating roles"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"social anxiety":4.0,"academic performance":3.0,"college students":3.0,"fear":3.0,"Social media use":2.0,"the chain mediating roles":2.0,"the moderating effect":2.0,"teacher":2.0,"FoMO":2.0,"the mechanisms":1.0}},"age_hours":18.767422644444448,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.6104999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0366,"joy":0.0062,"surprise":0.0056,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.9353,"anger":0.0058,"disgust":0.0038},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the impact of social media use on academic performance, identifying social anxiety and FoMO as mediating factors.

To address these challenges, this paper presents FLEX-SFL, a flexible and efficient split federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model partitioning, client selection, and communication scheduling. FLEX-SFL incorporates three coordinated mechanisms: a device-aware adaptive segmentation strategy that dynamically adjusts model partition points based on client computational capacity to mitigate straggler effects; an entropy-driven client selection algorithm that promotes data representativeness by leveraging label distribution entropy; and a hierarchical local asynchronous aggregation scheme that enables asynchronous intra-cluster and inter-cluster model updates to improve training throughput and reduce communication latency. We theoretically establish the convergence properties of FLEX-SFL under convex settings and analyze the influence of local update frequency and client participation on convergence bounds. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that FLEX-SFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL and split FL baselines in terms of model accuracy, convergence speed, and resource efficiency, particularly under high degrees of statistical and system heterogeneity.

However, their efficient implementation requires architecture-level optimization tailored to limited device resources. This study presents an optimized YOLOv2 accelerator for the Zynq-7000 system-on-chip (SoC). The design employs 16-bit integer quantization, a filter reuse structure, an input feature map reuse scheme using a line buffer, and tiling parameter optimization for the convolution and max pooling layers to maximize resource efficiency. In addition, a stall-based control mechanism is introduced to prevent structural hazards in the pipeline. The proposed accelerator was implemented on the Zynq-7000 SoC board, and a system-level evaluation confirmed a negligible accuracy drop of only 0.2% compared with the 32-bit floating-point baseline. Compared with previous YOLO accelerators on the same SoC, the design achieved up to 26% and 15% reductions in flip-flop and digital signal processor usage, respectively.

Methods: A total of 29 Chinese male boxers were recruited to participate in four different intensities of muscle activation through BS and SJ exercises (BS50%, SJ50%, BS80%, SJ80%). The participants were tested on their jab and cross using specialized testing protocols at recovery intervals of 4, 8, 12, and 16 min (speed-striking strength testing was conducted first, followed by maximum-striking strength testing), and the maximum-striking strength and speed-striking strength of the athletes were recorded. Results: (1) Maximum-striking strength: For the jab, the results indicated that there were significant differences between BS50% at 8 min and 12 min and the baseline (p < 0.01), and between SJ50% at 4, 8, and 12 min and the baseline (p < 0.01). BS80% showed significant differences at 12 min compared to baseline (p < 0.01), and the SJ80% exhibited significant differences at 8 min (p < 0.05) and 12 min (p < 0.01) compared to baseline. For the cross, BS50% demonstrated significant differences at 12 min compared to baseline (p < 0.01), and SJ50% showed significant differences at 8 min and 12 min (p < 0.01). Both BS80% and SJ80% revealed significant differences at 8, 12, and 16 min compared to baseline (p < 0.01). (2) Speed-striking strength: For the jab, there were no significant differences between BS50% and SJ50% at all time intervals compared to baseline (p > 0.05). BS80% showed a significant difference at 4 min compared to baseline (p < 0.05), and SJ80% exhibited significant differences at 12 min compared to baseline (p < 0.01). For the cross, there were no significant differences between BS50%, SJ50%, and BS80% at all time intervals compared to baseline (p > 0.05), while SJ80% demonstrated significant differences at 8 min and 12 min compared to between (p < 0.01). The results showed that PAPE significantly enhanced maximum punch force at 8–12 min across several activation conditions. In contrast, improvements in speed-striking force were only observed following high-load squat jump (SJ at 80% 1 RM), with significant increases at 8 min for the cross and at 12 min for the jab, whereas BS or lower-load SJ produced no meaningful changes. Conclusions: PAPE activation significantly enhances the striking force of boxers at the recovery interval of 12 min, but the effect is influenced by the intensity and method of activation. High-load activation can enhance the striking strength of boxers more rapidly and sustainably, and high-load SJ are more beneficial for the speed-striking strength of boxers.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6356","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:15.384887","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":461,"author":"Chao Chen","raw_content_length":2974,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":2.305,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["SJ50%","BS80%"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2873,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Objective","The purpose","this study","the effects","the maximum-striking strength","speed-striking strength","the jab","cross"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["this study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Objective":1.0,"The purpose":1.0,"this study":1.0,"the effects":1.0,"the maximum-striking strength":1.0,"speed-striking strength":1.0,"the jab":1.0,"cross":1.0}},"age_hours":18.768511538888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8721,"joy":0.0258,"surprise":0.0295,"sadness":0.0112,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.0238,"disgust":0.027},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is a research study investigating the effects of different squat exercises on the striking strength of boxers.

However, owing to their operating principle, they require an additional active integrating circuit to produce an output voltage or current that is directly proportional to the input current. A signal conditioner has the most significant impact on the overall conversion accuracy of the combined transducer. In this paper, a new measurement system and testing procedure utilizing a digital power meter and arbitrary waveform generator are proposed. This approach enables the characterization of the conversion accuracy of both types of active integrators: voltage-to-voltage and voltage-to-current converters. The conversion error for distorted input voltage harmonics and additional phase shift across a range of frequencies are determined. Instead of using the actual signal from the Rogowski coil during testing —which would be challenging owing to the required high RMS value of the distorted current for its input and difficulties in accurately measuring the RMS values of harmonics and their phase angles in relation to the output voltage or current of the tested converter—an arbitrary waveform generator is used. The input voltage to the active integrating circuit replicates the output voltage of the Rogowski coil: as the harmonic order increases, its RMS voltage rises proportionally.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6357","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:15.385210","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Michal Kaczmarek","raw_content_length":1390,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Measurement System"],"persons":["Voltage Rogowski","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1370,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Measurement System","Testing Procedure","Characterization","the Conversion Accuracy","Voltage","Rogowski coils","electricity metering systems","their operating principle"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Measurement System":2.0,"Testing Procedure":2.0,"Characterization":2.0,"the Conversion Accuracy":2.0,"Voltage":2.0,"Rogowski coils":1.0,"electricity metering systems":1.0,"their operating principle":1.0}},"age_hours":18.768526989999998,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.9245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5849,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8582,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0113,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0406,"anger":0.0311,"disgust":0.0471},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a new measurement system for characterizing the accuracy of active integrators used with Rogowski coils in electricity metering.

Recent studies on feature extraction, time-series modeling, and multi-task learning have shown remarkable advancements. However, most deep learning (DL) techniques predominantly focus on unimodal data or static feature extraction techniques, resulting in a lack of RUL prediction methods that can effectively capture the individual differences among heterogeneous sensors and failure modes under complex operational conditions. To overcome these limitations, an adaptive RUL prediction framework named ADAPT-RULNet is proposed for mechanical components, integrating the feature extraction capabilities of attention-enhanced deep learning (DL) and the decision-making abilities of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to achieve end-to-end optimization from raw data to accurate RUL prediction. Initially, Functional Alignment Resampling (FAR) is employed to generate high-quality functional signals; then, attention-enhanced Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is leveraged to obtain individual degradation stages. Subsequently, an attention-enhanced of hybrid multi-scale RUL prediction network is constructed to extract both local and global features from multi-format data. Furthermore, the network achieves optimal feature representation by adaptively fusing multi-source features through Bayesian methods. Finally, we innovatively introduce a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) strategy from DRL to adaptively optimize key parameters in the construction of individual degradation stages and achieve a global balance between model complexity and prediction accuracy. The proposed model was evaluated on aircraft engines and railway freight car wheels. The results indicate that it achieves a lower average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and higher accuracy in comparison with current approaches. Moreover, the method shows strong potential for improving prediction accuracy and robustness in varied industrial applications.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6354","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:15.385550","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":281,"author":"Yi Xu","raw_content_length":2155,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.405,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Prognostics and Health Management","ADAPT","PHM","Remaining Useful Life"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2155,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","An Adaptive Framework","Deep Reinforcement Learning","The prediction","Remaining Useful Life","RUL","a vital aspect","Prognostics","Health Management"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"An Adaptive Framework":2.0,"Deep Reinforcement Learning":2.0,"The prediction":1.0,"Remaining Useful Life":1.0,"RUL":1.0,"a vital aspect":1.0,"Prognostics":1.0,"Health Management":1.0}},"age_hours":18.76854228972222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.909,"joy":0.0143,"surprise":0.0243,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.0261,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework (ADAPT-RULNet) for predicting the remaining useful life of mechanical components, which could lead to reduced waste and improved efficiency in industries like aviation and rail.

Such heating leads to downward heat transfer and latent heat flux from the surface to subsurface aquifers. This study used Landsat optical and thermal satellite data for land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), and anthropogenic heat flux (Has) change mapping in Bangalore City, India. The in situ sensor-based land surface temperature (LST) and groundwater temperature (GWT) measurements were used to validate the study outcome. A minor difference was observed between the satellite data and the in situ LST due to the differential data acquisition time. The built-up area increased from 7.61% to 28.78% from 1999 to 2017 at the cost of the green cover and the extent of waterbodies. Therefore, LST change was higher in green cover areas (~6 °C LST) than in urban areas (>3 °C). The anthropogenic heat fluxes increased significantly (above 65 W/m2) during the study period. The in situ GWT was strongly correlated with the Has (R2 = 0.83) and LST (R2 = 0.78). The study highlights the nature of urban expansion in Bangalore City, India, and its impact on LST, Has, and GWT. The observed changes in land use practices with urban heat indicators at 30 m scale can be used for sustainable land use planning to improve the thermal comfort of the city, preserving the urban ecosystems. The high collinearity between satellite-data-derived LST, Has, and GWT can be used for periodic monitoring at seasonal and annual scales using the Landsat data, which can be important inputs for land use planners and policymakers.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6351","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:15.385904","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":267,"author":"K.

Among the different approaches for evaluating its characteristics, methods based on electromagnetic waves have been proposed in the literature over the years. In this context, the characterization of concrete complex dielectric permittivity ϵr(f) (where f is the frequency) has received considerable attention, taking into account that its values and its frequency behavior are both sensitive to a series of physical parameters, which in turn can significantly influence the mechanical performance of concrete. Recently, data-driven techniques have emerged as alternatives for modeling material properties due to their regression and generalization potential. Following this research line in this work, we investigated the potential of Gaussian Process Regression to model ϵr(f) by comparing its performance with that of the model most employed to characterize the concrete dielectric permittivity: the universal Jonscher model. The inherent ability to provide predictions accompanied by confidence intervals, which allows the assessment of the reliability of the permittivity estimate across frequency, and the related error metrics demonstrate that GPR can effectively characterize ϵr(f) in an effective manner, outperforming the Jonscher model in terms of accuracy in all the cases considered in our study.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6350","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:15.386820","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Filippo Laganá","raw_content_length":1453,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Data Concrete"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1423,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","A Data","Concrete diagnosis","an important task","informed decisions","buildings","the different approaches","its characteristics","methods"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Data":2.0,"Concrete diagnosis":1.0,"an important task":1.0,"informed decisions":1.0,"buildings":1.0,"the different approaches":1.0,"its characteristics":1.0,"methods":1.0}},"age_hours":18.768604049166665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9324,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0179,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.011,"disgust":0.0172},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to model the dielectric permittivity of concrete, which can help diagnose structural integrity and inform repair decisions.

The research giant marked its 100th anniversary in May at its venerable campus in Murray Hill—part of New Providence, N.J.—where major technological developments have occurred, such as the Bellmac-32 microprocessor and the satellite Earth station known as the Horn Antenna, which helped prove the big bang theory.The company also held a groundbreaking ceremony on 4 September for its new headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., about 32 kilometers south of Murray Hill and 10 km from IEEE’s Piscataway office.Construction of the 10-story, 34,374-square-meter building is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2027. The Health and Life Science Exchange 2 building, known as HELIX 2, is the second of three planned edifices being constructed in the city’s new innovation district, which is designed to attract research labs, workspaces, and office suites for startups. Attendees at the ceremony included Thierry E. Klein, the Bell Labs solutions research president, and Peter Vetter, the Bell Labs core research president. Both men are IEEE Fellows. New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, was there too, as were New Brunswick Mayor James Cahill and other state and local officials.“Today’s groundbreaking marks a new and exciting chapter in Bell Labs’ long history in New Jersey,” Klein said. “As we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast. The location offers unique advantages that will accelerate our innovation capabilities and provide greater proximity to academic centers of excellence and fantastic new startups and ventures.”The new location, he said, “will give access to a vibrant and urban environment that will help us attract the next generation of talent. Access to universities such as Princeton, Rutgers, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the Stevens Institute of Technology is incomparable. This is not just a move for the next two, three, four, or five years; this is going to be home for Bell Labs for a very, very long time.”A hub of innovationNokia Bell Labs could have relocated its headquarters anywhere in the world, Murphy noted, but it chose to remain in New Jersey.“Our illustrious history of innovation in New Jersey could be summarized in two words: Bell Labs,” the governor said. “For over a century, Bell Labs has transformed our state, our nation, and the world. This is literally an iconic and globally unique institution. We break ground and start to establish a new foundation for quantum physics, generative artificial intelligence, and optical communications. Through partnerships, joint ventures, and spinoffs, Nokia Bell Labs will facilitate new products and companies that will [continue to] drive the innovation economy in New Jersey.”To ensure New Jersey would be at the forefront of innovation, the governor in 2018 announced his intent to establish 12 innovation hubs throughout the state as a way to attract entrepreneurs, startups, and early-stage companies. The first hub—the HELIX 1 building, adjacent to Nokia Bell Labs’ new headquarters—is expected to open next year and include Rutgers’s medical school and translational research institute. New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, at the podium addresses attendees at the groundbreaking ceremony. NokiaThe facilities will offer furnished offices and labs outfitted with scientific equipment, officials say. Tenants will include Hackensack Meridian Health and Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health.New Brunswick is no stranger to innovators, Cahill noted. The Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company is headquartered in the city and got its start in a local wallpaper factory. The Johnson brothers and Thomas Edison often ate at a nearby drugstore lunch counter, where they discussed advancements in manufacturing, the mayor said. Edison’s laboratory was in Menlo Park. Cahill also said that Albert Einstein, who worked at Princeton University and lived in the town, was often spotted strolling the streets of New Brunswick, about 30 km away.State-of-the-art research facilitiesThe new Nokia Bell Lab offices will cater to the needs of research scientists and specialists in focused areas, Klein said.“It’s an efficient, modern, and low-carbon facility providing sustainable power, heating, and cooling capabilities,” he said. “Our researchers will have access to the best facility possible. That is our dream.”This is not the first time Bell Labs has moved its headquarters, Vetter noted. The primary R&D activities were set up in New York City in 1925. They moved to Murray Hill in 1941. Some of the biggest innovations were developed there during the following decade, including the transistor and the cellular network.“I want to think that our move will again be a catalyst for breakthrough innovations to happen in the decade after we move in and will be in a variety of areas such as 7G, AI, quantum computing, and quantum network security,” Vetter said.“As we build and move into the HELIX, this continues our legacy of excellence, pioneering spirit, and commitment to breakthrough research on the East Coast.” —Thierry Klein“We also need to make sure the research goes into the real world,” he said. “We like to say that if somebody has a problem in the real world and you solve it in the lab but you don’t make that leap of technology into the real world, the problem still exists.“It’s not just research or breakthrough technologies,” he added. “It’s also creating the companies that will commercialize these technologies and lead the next century of innovation.”IEEE Milestones recognize Bell Labs innovationsAnother celebratory event is scheduled for 21 October in Murray Hill. Several technologies developed there are to be designated as IEEE Milestones. The technologies include three Nobel Prize winners: super-resolved microscopy, the charge-coupled device, and the fractional quantum hall effect. IEEE Region 1 and the IEEE North Jersey Section sponsored the nominations.Administered by the IEEE History Center and supported by donors, the Milestones program recognizes outstanding technical developments around the world.Watch for The Institute’s article on the Nokia Bell Labs Milestone achievement ceremony in November.","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nokia-bell-labs-new-headquarters","published_date":"2025-10-14T18:00:03","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:16.809778","language":"en","tags":["ieee_milestone","ieee_news","industry","engineering","typeti","ieee_member_news","technology","ieee","nokia_bell_labs","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE Spectrum","source_category":"science","word_count":968,"author":"Kathy Pretz","raw_content_length":10330,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":4.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nokia Bell Labs Breaks Ground","The Health and Life Science Exchange 2","Attendees","IEEE"],"persons":["Nokia Bell Labs","Murray Hill"],"locations":["Piscataway","Murray Hill","New Providence","N.J.","Earth","New Brunswick"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":6287,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nokia Bell Labs Breaks Ground","Its New NJ Headquarters","Nokia Bell Labs","a lot","The research giant","its 100th anniversary","May","its venerable campus","Murray Hill","part"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["The research giant"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nokia Bell Labs Breaks Ground":2.0,"Its New NJ Headquarters":2.0,"Nokia Bell Labs":1.0,"a lot":1.0,"The research giant":1.0,"its 100th anniversary":1.0,"May":1.0,"its venerable campus":1.0,"Murray Hill":1.0,"part":1.0}},"age_hours":0.7684710263888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1294,"joy":0.7454,"surprise":0.1007,"sadness":0.0087,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0062,"disgust":0.0027},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the groundbreaking of a new Nokia Bell Labs headquarters, which is intended to foster innovation in areas like 7G, AI, quantum computing, and quantum network security.

D. Don","content":"The growing worldwide demand for essential oils (EOs) brings new opportunities for Azorean Cryptomeria japonica aerial parts waste valorization. Therefore, the phytochemical and bioactivity investigation of EOs from different Azorean C. japonica tissues, such as twigs (Az–CJT), remains imperative to add more value to C. japonica’s EO industry, alongside the contribution to the local sustainable circular bioeconomy. This study provides, for the first time, GC–MS analysis and brine shrimp toxicity of the EO hydrodistilled from Az–CJT and aims to compare these parameters with those determined for a commercial Azorean C. japonica (branches and foliage) EO obtained through steam distillation. The main Az–CJT EO components were α-eudesmol (19.53%), phyllocladene (14.80%), elemol (12.43%), nezukol (11.34%), and γ-eudesmol (5.32%), while α-pinene (28.62%), sabinene (24.30%), phyllocladene (5.10%), β-myrcene (5.09%), and limonene (4.93%) dominated in the commercial EO. Thus, Az–CJT EO exhibited the highest sesquiterpenoids (43.52%), diterpenes (20.85%), and diterpenoids (13.21%) content, while the commercial EO was dominated by monoterpenes (74.61%). The Az–CJT EO displayed significantly higher toxicity than the commercial EO, with mortality rates of 87.7% and 16.9%, respectively, at 100 µg/mL. This result is likely related to the substantially higher terpenoid content of Az–CJT EO (61.20% vs. 9.44%), largely attributed to the sesquiterpenoid fraction. Due to its distinct chemical profile, Az–CJT EO may have differential commercial applications, warranting further investigation into its bioactive value and safe use. In conclusion, this study adds knowledge on the potentialities of C. japonica aerial parts’ EOs from the Azorean region.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9118","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:17.479745","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Elisabete Lima","raw_content_length":1904,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Chemical Composition","Azorean Cryptomeria","Brine Shrimp Toxicity","nezukol"],"persons":["Azorean C. japonica","D.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_5f39dcb1eccc","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9112: Impact of Roof Configurations on Indoor Condensation in High","content":"In the subtropical regions of southern China, springtime is often characterized by persistently high humidity, leading to frequent condensation on building envelopes and interior surfaces. Top-floor rooms are particularly vulnerable due to their direct exposure to outdoor conditions through walls and the roof, making condensation prevention a critical concern. This study is grounded in the residential habits and spatial preferences of southern Chinese residents and evaluates three roof configurations—standard, thickened, and green roofs—using EnergyPlus (v22.1.0) simulation software to analyze their effects on indoor relative humidity levels in top-floor spaces. The results demonstrate that green roof systems significantly reduce indoor relative humidity, especially in high-rise residential buildings. Taking a 30-story residential building as an example, with a conventional roof, the indoor relative humidity remains at 100% for extended periods during high-risk condensation intervals, resulting in surface condensation. In contrast, when a green roof with a soil depth of 70 cm and daylilies at a height of 100 cm is used, the peak indoor maximum relative humidity is reduced by 10–40%, and the duration of condensation decreases to zero. Among the factors involved in green roofs, including plant height, soil depth, and leaf area index (LAI), soil depth shows a significant negative correlation with the maximum indoor relative humidity (correlation coefficient r = −0.987, p < 0.01), while the LAI exhibits a positive correlation with the maximum indoor relative humidity (r = 0.180, p < 0.05). Selecting plant species with a low LAI and increasing soil depth are effective passive strategies for humidity control and condensation prevention. These findings establish a basis for optimizing building environmental models and propose passive design strategies to enhance overall performance. In addition, the study highlights how roof greening contributes to global sustainability goals, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and SDG 13 (Climate Action), by improving indoor comfort, enhancing resilience, and reducing climate-related risks.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9112","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:17.480517","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":315,"author":"Bing Wang","raw_content_length":2268,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.575,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["v22.1.0"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2214,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Impact","Roof Configurations","Indoor Condensation","High","the subtropical regions","southern China","springtime","persistently high humidity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Impact":2.0,"Roof Configurations":2.0,"Indoor Condensation":2.0,"High":2.0,"the subtropical regions":1.0,"southern China":1.0,"springtime":1.0,"persistently high humidity":1.0}},"age_hours":18.769387260555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.2935,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5413,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3548,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0137,"sadness":0.0224,"fear":0.5259,"anger":0.0292,"disgust":0.0493},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study uses EnergyPlus simulation software to analyze the impact of different roof configurations on indoor humidity.

The survey, based on an original questionnaire (49 questions, 7 sections), covered 406 people. The scale was based on an analysis of self-perception of creativity competence among pre-service teachers. Analysis of the results showed that 12.8% of respondents had a high level of creativity, 56.4% had an average level, and 30.8% had a low level. No significant correlations were found between the level of creative competence and gender or age, while place of origin showed a slight tendency to differentiate. Students most often declared reflectiveness, openness to learning, and independence in problem solving, while less often confidence in predicting the effects of their own actions and resistance to routine.

To address this challenge, three single-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with carbon anodes and zinc cathodes were designed and operated for 35 days in a closed circuit. Voltage, current, pH, conductivity, ORP, and COD were monitored. FTIR-ATR spectroscopy (range 4000–400 cm−1) was applied to identify structural changes, and polarization curves were constructed to estimate internal resistance. The main FTIR peaks were observed at 1027, 1636, 3237, and 3374 cm−1, indicating the degradation of polysaccharides and hydroxyl groups. The maximum voltage reached was 0.961 ± 0.025 V, and the peak current was 3.052 ± 0.084 mA on day 16, coinciding with an optimal pH of 4.977 ± 0.058, a conductivity of 194.851 ± 2.847 mS/cm, and an ORP of 126.707 ± 6.958 mV. Connecting the three MFCs in series yielded a total voltage of 2.34 V. Taxonomic analysis of the anodic biofilm revealed a community dominated by Firmicutes (genus Lactobacillus: L. acidophilus, L. brevis, L. casei, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, and L. plantarum), along with Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria (electrogenic bacteria).

This study examines the impact of extreme climate risks on corporate green innovation through the State-Pressure-Response framework, using data from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2014 and 2024. Results demonstrate that extreme climate risks significantly promote corporate green innovation levels. Mechanistically, climate risks exacerbate companies’ financing constraints, yet under evolving green finance architectures, this financial pressure can drive them toward green innovation to improve their access to preferential green financing channels. Media attention amplifies this sustainability-oriented response by heightening reputational stakes, while managerial myopia weakens it by prioritizing immediate performance over long-term sustainable development. The effect is most pronounced among heavily polluting industries and state-owned enterprises, revealing differential pathways toward sustainable transformation.

This research introduces a fault-tolerant hybrid parallel compensator architecture for load frequency control (LFC), combining a Proportional–Integral–Derivative with Filter (PIDF) compensator with a Fuzzy Fractional-Order PI-PD (Fuzzy FOPI–FOPD) module. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) determines optimal PID gains, while the Catch Fish Optimization Algorithm (CFOA) tunes the Fuzzy FOPI–FOPD parameters—both minimizing the Integral Time Absolute Error (ITAE) index. The parallel compensator structure guarantees continuous operation during subsystem faults, substantially boosting grid reliability. Rigorous partial failure tests confirm uncompromised performance-controlled degradation. Benchmark comparisons against contemporary controllers reveal the proposed architecture’s superiority, quantifiable through transient metric enhancements: undershoot suppression (−9.57 × 10−5 p.u. to −1.17 × 10−7 p.u.), settling time improvement (8.8000 s to 3.1511 s), and ITAE reduction (0.0007891 to 0.0000001608), verifying precision and stability gains. Resilience analyses across parameter drift and step load scenarios, simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, demonstrate superior disturbance attenuation and operational stability. These outcomes confirm the solution’s robustness, dependability, and field readiness.

Ordinary least squares estimates show that stronger ESG performance is associated with significantly higher total factor productivity, and the effect is more pronounced in heavy-polluting industries. Mechanism tests indicate that ESG disclosure mediates this relationship, with its influence emerging over time and strengthening in subsequent years. The mediation also varies across ESG pillars, with social disclosure exerting the most decisive influence.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_e7fe8f8e356f","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9107: The Impact of Carbon Risk on Value Creation of High","content":"Based on the Cost Theory and Porter’s Hypothesis, this study focuses on high-carbon-emission enterprises and systematically explores how carbon risk affects their value creation. The sample comprises listed firms in high-carbon-emission industries listed on China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen A-shares during 2012–2022. A carbon risk measurement index is constructed using industrial energy consumption data, and a two-way fixed-effects model is employed to empirically test the relationship between carbon risk and value creation of these enterprises. Further, the internal mechanisms by which debt financing costs and innovation R&D expenditures influence the impact of carbon risk on enterprise value creation are analyzed separately. Finally, differences in the inhibitory effect of carbon risk on value creation across heterogeneous enterprises are examined. The results show that carbon risk significantly reduces value creation. It raises debt financing costs and diverts resources away from innovation, weakening firms’ capacity to create value.

This results in lower separate collection and recycling rates as well as fewer studies analysing recycling-relevant characteristics in non-packaging plastic waste (NPW), which are relevant to ensure the circularity and sustainable management of all plastics. This study presents a detailed characterisation of NPW found in mixed municipal solid waste and lightweight packaging waste on polymer and product levels, using the case study of Vienna, Austria. Results show that 4100 t/yr of polymers targeted for recycling, especially polypropylene, are currently discarded and lost in mixed MSW. A large share of NPW, however, exhibits recycling-hindering traits like multi-polymer objects or black colouring. While products made of high-quality food contact material were assessed to be ideal for separate collection to ensure closed-loop recycling, consideration should be given to collecting the majority of NPW via recycling centres to prevent contamination of target polymers with currently non-targeted other polymers. Design for recycling guidelines should also be introduced for non-packaging plastics, targeting separability, colouring and small-scale products.

South Korea’s ‘Safety Speed 5030’ policy introduced lower urban speed limits to enhance road safety, but speed limit reductions alone may not be sufficient to change driver behavior. This paper investigates how spatial and environmental factors beyond speed limits affect drivers’ speed choice. Using point-level speed data from Jeju Island’s C-ITS dataset combined with GIS information, spatial econometric techniques were employed to capture spatial dependencies in speeding degree. Results show that a spatial lag model (SLM) outperforms ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial error models (SEMs), providing higher explanatory power and more consistent parameter estimates. Key factors influencing drivers’ speed choice include road geometry (e.g., curvature, number of lanes), node-level features (e.g., intersections, property change points), and the presence of enforcement measures. The findings suggest that the reduction in speed limits alone may not guarantee a corresponding decrease in vehicle speed.

Against the backdrop of China’s high-quality urban renewal phase guided by the “anti-massive demolition and construction” policy, this study constructs a calibrated tripartite evolutionary game among government, investors, and residents. By embedding culture–economy parameters—cultural renovation intensity (k), operational profit-sharing ratio between investors and residents (j), cultural identification coefficient (i), and cost-sharing coefficient (w)—we establish a behavioral interaction mechanism of “cultural value conversion–benefit-sharing–cultural identification–cost-sharing.” Simulations based on replicator dynamics demonstrate that sustained tripartite cooperation requires four conditions: cultural intensity surpasses the cost threshold (k ∈ [0.6, 0.7]); the profit-sharing ratio preserves market incentives (j ∈ [0.25, 0.35]); cultural identification reaches a minimum threshold (i ≥ 0.4); and residents’ cost-sharing does not exceed their benefit capacity (w ≤ 0.2). These findings reveal the core tension in China’s high-quality urban renewal stage—namely, the challenge of instituting sustainable operational mechanisms under cultural protection constraints—and globally provide a quantifiable policy toolbox for culture-led urban regeneration.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9095","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:17.489639","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Zhongping Wu","raw_content_length":1645,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1453,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","The EconomicCultural Dynamics","Urban Regeneration","Cities","demolition","redevelopment-driven expansion","high-quality regeneration","stock upgrading","cultural continuity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["redevelopment-driven expansion"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The EconomicCultural Dynamics":2.0,"Urban Regeneration":2.0,"Cities":1.0,"demolition":1.0,"redevelopment-driven expansion":1.0,"high-quality regeneration":1.0,"stock upgrading":1.0,"cultural continuity":1.0}},"age_hours":18.76957615638889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9101,"joy":0.0154,"surprise":0.0201,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0206,"anger":0.0161,"disgust":0.0136},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical framework and simulation results for urban regeneration, focusing on the interplay between economic and cultural factors.

Effective scrap prediction enables manufacturers to take proactive measures to minimize waste generation, thereby supporting sustainability goals and improving production efficiency. This study proposes a hybrid ensemble framework that integrates CatBoost and XGBoost, combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to enhance prediction accuracy in industrial applications. The model exploits the complementary strengths of both algorithms by applying weighted averaging and stacked generalization, allowing it to process heterogeneous datasets containing both categorical and numerical variables. A case study in the aerospace manufacturing sector demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to standalone models, the PSO-enhanced hybrid ensemble achieved more than a 30% reduction in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), confirming its ability to capture complex interactions among diverse process parameters. Feature importance analysis further showed that categorical attributes, such as machine type and operator, are as influential as numerical parameters, underscoring the need for hybrid modeling. Although the model requires higher computational effort, the integration of PSO significantly improves robustness and scalability. By reducing scrap and optimizing resource utilization, the proposed framework provides a data-driven pathway toward greener, more resource-efficient, and resilient manufacturing systems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9106","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:17.489926","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Ergün Eraslan","raw_content_length":1657,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CatBoost","XGBoost","Scrap Reduction Accurate","Particle Swarm Optimization"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1657,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Toward","Green Manufacturing","A Heuristic Hybrid Machine Learning Framework","PSO","Scrap Reduction","Accurate scrap forecasting","green manufacturing","defective output"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability","A Heuristic Hybrid Machine Learning Framework"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Toward":2.0,"Green Manufacturing":2.0,"A Heuristic Hybrid Machine Learning Framework":2.0,"PSO":2.0,"Scrap Reduction":2.0,"Accurate scrap forecasting":1.0,"green manufacturing":1.0,"defective output":1.0}},"age_hours":18.76959017638889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.132,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8264,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9262,"joy":0.0234,"surprise":0.0128,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0107,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a hybrid machine learning framework to reduce scrap in aerospace manufacturing, resulting in resource conservation and reduced environmental impact.

{"id":"science_plos_complex_systems_e89d35269b70","title":"The shape of waning vaccinal immunity: Implications for control","content":"by Graham R. Northrup, Mike Boots, Chadi M. Saad-Roy The COVID-19 pandemic and current uncertainties about H5N1 influenza underscore the importance of vaccination for both community immunity and to prevent pathogen invasion. While the duration of a fully-immune period is often included in epidemiological models with waning immunity, the relative susceptibility to infection in fully-waned individuals and moreover their interplay that determines the shape of the trajectory of waning vaccinal immunity also may have important impacts on pathogen invasion potential. In this paper, we examine pathogen invasion outcomes with a simple mathematical framework that embeds the shape of vaccinal immunity within a buffered susceptibility framework. Using illustrative examples, we show pathogen invasion hinges on the characteristics of this shape, resulting in a large variation in outcomes. A key result is that stronger immunity (i.e. a smaller relative susceptibility in fully-waned individuals) can have a dramatic impact on such invasion characteristics, but the magnitude of this effect crucially depends on the underlying shape of immunity: the initial rate of waning is critical to the outcome. Our results highlight the importance of measuring the relative susceptibility of infection in fully-waned individuals. Additionally, they illustrate the importance of characterising host immune responses granularly and of taking this into account in pathogen-specific epidemiological models.","source":"science_plos_complex_systems","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcsy.0000071","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:34.853234","language":"en","tags":["open-access","complexity","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Complex Systems","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Chadi M.

Glynatsi, Christian Hilbe, Yohsuke Murase Indirect reciprocity is a key mechanism for large-scale cooperation. This mechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and maintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social norms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each others’ reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual actions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain cooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily stable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy. In this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment regime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading eight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types of errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify norms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the zero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a rigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through indirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013584","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:41.622542","language":"en","tags":["open-access","methods","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Yohsuke Murase","raw_content_length":1263,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Yohsuke Murase Indirect","Nikoleta E.

Alterations in cell cycle dynamics have been linked to the onset of various diseases, underscoring the need for quantitative methods to analyze cell cycle progression. Here we develop RepliFlow, a model-based approach to infer cell cycle dynamics from flow cytometry data of DNA content in asynchronous cell populations. We show that RepliFlow captures not only changes in the length of each cell cycle phase but also alterations in the underlying DNA replication dynamics. RepliFlow is species-agnostic and recapitulates results from more sophisticated analyses based on nucleotide incorporation. Finally, we propose a minimal DNA replication model that enables the derivation of microscopic observables from population-wide DNA content measurements. Our work presents a scalable framework for inferring cell cycle dynamics from flow cytometry data, enabling the characterization of replication programme alterations.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013570","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:41.622941","language":"en","tags":["open-access","methods","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Pablo Sartori","raw_content_length":1098,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Marco Fumasoni","Adolfo Alsina"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1090,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Model","cell cycle dynamics","Adolfo Alsina","Marco Fumasoni","Pablo Sartori","The eukaryotic cell cycle","several processes","a timely manner","Alterations","the onset"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Model"],"business_innovation":["Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Model":2.0,"cell cycle dynamics":2.0,"Adolfo Alsina":1.0,"Marco Fumasoni":1.0,"Pablo Sartori":1.0,"The eukaryotic cell cycle":1.0,"several processes":1.0,"a timely manner":1.0,"Alterations":1.0,"the onset":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781267885555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9332,"joy":0.0148,"surprise":0.0197,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0071,"anger":0.0159,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a model (RepliFlow) for analyzing cell cycle dynamics.

Deep learning approaches have recently shown promise to advance, automatize and accelerate analysis. However, most of the interest has been given to the segmentation of static objects of 2D/3D images whereas the segmentation of dynamic processes obtained from time-lapse acquisitions has been less explored. Here we adapted DeepFinder, a U-Net originally designed for 3D noisy cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data, for the detection of rare dynamic exocytosis events (termed ExoDeepFinder) observed in temporal series of 2D Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) images. ExoDeepFinder achieved good absolute performances with a relatively small training dataset of 12000 events in 60 cells. We rigorously compared deep learning performances with unsupervised conventional methods from the literature. ExoDeepFinder outcompeted the tested methods, but also exhibited a greater plasticity to the experimental conditions when tested under drug treatments and after changes in cell line or imaged reporter. This robustness to unseen experimental conditions did not require re-training demonstrating generalization capability of our deep learning model. ExoDeepFinder, as well as the annotated training datasets, were made transparent and available through an open-source software as well as a Napari plugin and can directly be applied to custom user data. The apparent plasticity and performances of ExoDeepFinder to detect dynamic events open new opportunities for future deep learning guided analysis of dynamic processes in live-cell imaging.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013556","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:41.623374","language":"en","tags":["open-access","methods","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Charles Kervrann","raw_content_length":1793,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["U-Net","Anne-Sophie Macé","DeepFinder","2D Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy"],"persons":["Charles Kervrann Segmentation","Hugo Lachuer","Arthur Masson","Emmanuel Moebel","Kristine Schauer"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1785,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Deep learning detection","dynamic exocytosis events","fluorescence","microscopy","Hugo Lachuer","Emmanuel Moebel","Anne-Sophie Macé","Arthur Masson","Kristine Schauer","Charles Kervrann Segmentation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep learning detection"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Deep learning detection":2.0,"dynamic exocytosis events":2.0,"fluorescence":2.0,"microscopy":2.0,"Hugo Lachuer":1.0,"Emmanuel Moebel":1.0,"Anne-Sophie Macé":1.0,"Arthur Masson":1.0,"Kristine Schauer":1.0,"Charles Kervrann Segmentation":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781283198611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.323,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8646,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8808,"joy":0.0199,"surprise":0.0394,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0263,"anger":0.0141,"disgust":0.0142},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a deep learning model (ExoDeepFinder) for detecting exocytosis events in microscopy images.

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during November 2023 and included 763 adolescents currently residing in Lebanon (mean age 16.08 ± 1.74 years, 37.6% males and 62.4% females) recruited from all Lebanese governorates using a snowball sampling technique. Data were collected via an online questionnaire and analyzed using the PROCESS Macro for mediation analysis. Results The findings indicated that both psychological distress (β = .39, BootSE = .04, 95% CI [.33,.46]) and wellbeing (β = .07, BootSE = .02, 95% CI [.03,.12]) partially mediated the relationship between anti-mattering and irritability. Adolescents with higher levels of anti-mattering reported greater distress and reduced wellbeing, both of which were associated with increased irritability. Conclusion Our results highlight the psychological relevance of anti-mattering in adolescence and suggest that addressing feelings of insignificance may play a key role in managing emotional dysregulation. Mental health practitioners and educators should consider developing culturally sensitive interventions that target feelings of anti-mattering, enhance wellbeing, and reduce psychological distress. School-based programs promoting emotional support and social inclusion may prove especially beneficial. Future studies should investigate these associations longitudinally and across varied cultural contexts to better inform prevention and intervention strategies.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334725","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.062419","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Souheil Hallit","raw_content_length":1873,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the PROCESS Macro",".04"],"persons":["Diana Malaeb","Michelle Abi Karam","Souheil Hallit Background","Fouad Sakr","Mariam Dabbous","Rabih Hallit","Feten Fekih-Romdhane","Sahar Obeid"],"locations":["Lebanon"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1838,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Psychological distress","wellbeing","mediators","anti","Michelle Abi Karam","Rabih Hallit","Diana Malaeb","Fouad Sakr","Mariam Dabbous","Feten Fekih-Romdhane"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Psychological distress":2.0,"wellbeing":2.0,"mediators":2.0,"anti":2.0,"Michelle Abi Karam":1.0,"Rabih Hallit":1.0,"Diana Malaeb":1.0,"Fouad Sakr":1.0,"Mariam Dabbous":1.0,"Feten Fekih-Romdhane":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781413279166666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5575000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8885,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1005,"joy":0.0178,"surprise":0.0029,"sadness":0.1387,"fear":0.7079,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0191},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study investigates the relationship between anti-mattering, psychological distress, wellbeing, and irritability in Lebanese adolescents.

HCC recurrence was significantly associated with the male sex (HR, 1.50, 95%CI; 1.17–1.93), elderly group (HR, 1.37, 95%CI; 1.10–1.95), ALBI grade 2 or 3 (HR, 1.39, 95%CI; 1.07–1.80), DCP ≥ 40 mAU/ml (HR, 1.41, 95%CI; 1.10–1.81), and persistent HCV infection (HR, 1.67, 95%CI; 1.30–2.15). The factors associated with liver disease-related death were ALBI grade 2 or 3 (HR, 2.17, 95% CI; 1.26–3.75), DCP ≥ 40 mAU/ml (HR, 2.33, 95% CI; 1.47–3.69), and persistent HCV infection (HR, 2.22, 95% CI; 1.39–3.56). Conclusions In RFA for tumors with diameters of ≤3 cm and ≤3 HCC nodules, age over ≥80 years was not a significant factor associated with OS or liver disease-related death. The results support that RFA would be a promising treatment option for patients with HCC patients aged ≥80 years.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334712","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.063073","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":425,"author":"Masayuki Kurosaki","raw_content_length":2761,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":2.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Kaoru Tsuchiya","SURF","Chiaki Maeyashiki","HCC","Mina Taguchi"],"persons":["Taisei Keitoku","Namiki Izumi","Masayuki Kurosaki Background","Shohei Tanaka","Haruka Miyamoto","Shohei Kimura","Yuzuki Tokunaga","Kenta Takaura","Naoki Uchihara","Risa Okada","Hiroyuki Nakanishi","Yutaka Yasui","Yuuki Tanaka","Junko Yagita","Yuka Takahashi","Nobuharu Tamaki"],"locations":["Mayu Higuchi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2726,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["patients","hepatocellular carcinoma","Clinical outcome","radiofrequency ablation","HCC","Kenta Takaura","Kaoru Tsuchiya","Mina Taguchi","Yuzuki Tokunaga","Naoki Uchihara"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"patients":3.0,"hepatocellular carcinoma":3.0,"Clinical outcome":2.0,"radiofrequency ablation":2.0,"HCC":2.0,"Kenta Takaura":1.0,"Kaoru Tsuchiya":1.0,"Mina Taguchi":1.0,"Yuzuki Tokunaga":1.0,"Naoki Uchihara":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781429583055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.554,"joy":0.0325,"surprise":0.0596,"sadness":0.177,"fear":0.1069,"anger":0.0223,"disgust":0.0477},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a retrospective study on the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in elderly patients.

The Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used extensively to explore health promoting behaviors; we explored the application of the HBM constructs to understand heat mitigation behaviors among U.S. adults. Online panel data from the Household Emergency Preparedness Survey was collected in May 2024 to explore knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors related to extreme heat mitigation among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. An outcome variable assessing likeliness to engage in heat mitigation behaviors was developed by dichotomizing a sum of responses to questions asking about likelihood to engage in different mitigation behaviors; scores were split on the median value to classify those “more likely” versus “less likely” to engage in mitigation behaviors. Descriptive statistics were used to explore HBM construct responses among our sample; logistic regression models examined whether perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, self-efficacy, and cues to action were associated with more likelihood to engage in heat mitigation behaviors, after controlling for age, sex, income, race/ethnicity, education, and political affiliation. We included 6095 responses to the online panel survey in our analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model including all HBM constructs and adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics found that higher degrees of perceived benefits (OR=1.30, 95% CI:1.22–1.39), self-efficacy (OR=3.69, 95% CI: 3.26–4.10), and cues to action (OR=1.48, 95% CI:1.38–1.60) were positively associated with being more likely to engage in heat mitigation behaviors.

Methods We analyzed data from 16,065 HSV-seropositive adults aged 20–59 years from the NHANES 1999–2016 cycles (mean age: 35.4 ± 8.5 years). The data were collected in the United States. Biological age acceleration and Phenotypic age acceleration were calculated as residuals from regressing KDM-based biological age and PhenoAge on chronological age, respectively. The mean (SD) values were –10.9 (10.4) and –3.4 (4.6) years. Over a median follow-up of 139 months, 551 all-cause and 131 cardiovascular deaths occurred. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations between biological age acceleration and mortality. Nonlinear associations and potential threshold effects were assessed using smooth curve fitting based on generalized additive models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Results Both biological age acceleration and Phenotypic age acceleration were significantly associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Among individuals with Phenotypic age acceleration > –1.8, each 5-year increase was associated with a 68% higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.47–1.92; P < 0.001).

{"id":"science_plos_one_9186fec195d9","title":"A Novel 2","content":"by Erdal Eker, Davut Izci, Serdar Ekinci, Fahmi Elsayed, Mohammad Salman Accurate and energy-efficient temperature regulation in electric furnace systems remains a challenging control problem due to nonlinear dynamics, significant thermal inertia, and inevitable time delays. Conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) and PID–acceleration (PIDA) controllers, though widely used, often exhibit degraded performance under such conditions, particularly when implemented in a single-degree-of-freedom. To address these limitations, this study proposes, for the first time, a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) PIDA controller tailored for electric furnace temperature control. The controller structure allows independent tuning of set-point tracking and disturbance rejection by introducing separate feedforward paths in the proportional and derivative channels while maintaining integral and acceleration actions on the error signal. To optimize the controller parameters, the recently developed greater cane rat algorithm (GCRA) is employed for the first time in this context. A novel adaptive objective function (combining normalized overshoot, normalized settling time, and cumulative tracking error) guides the tuning process to achieve a balanced improvement in both transient and steady-state performance. The proposed GCRA-based 2-DOF PIDA controller is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared against state-of-the-art metaheuristic tuning approaches, including polar fox optimization (PFA), hiking optimization (HOA), success-history based adaptive differential evolution with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), as well as several benchmark furnace control methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves faster settling times, reduced overshoot, and near-zero steady-state error, while maintaining robustness under external disturbances and measurement noise. For instance, in the nominal case, the method yields an overshoot of 1.8382% and a settling time of 3.4542 s, outperforming PFA, HOA, L-SHADE, and PSO. Robustness tests under load disturbances and measurement noise confirm stable operation with minimal performance degradation, achieving less than 2.5% overshoot and under 4 s settling time across all evaluated scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of the GCRA-based 2-DOF PIDA controller as a high-precision and energy-efficient solution for temperature regulation in industrial time-delay systems.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334594","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.065934","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":322,"author":"Mohammad Salman","raw_content_length":2530,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.61,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PID","Davut Izci"],"persons":["Erdal Eker","Serdar Ekinci","Fahmi Elsayed","Mohammad Salman Accurate"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2522,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Novel","Erdal Eker","Davut Izci","Serdar Ekinci","Fahmi Elsayed","Mohammad Salman Accurate","energy-efficient temperature regulation","electric furnace systems","a challenging control problem","nonlinear dynamics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Novel":2.0,"Erdal Eker":1.0,"Davut Izci":1.0,"Serdar Ekinci":1.0,"Fahmi Elsayed":1.0,"Mohammad Salman Accurate":1.0,"energy-efficient temperature regulation":1.0,"electric furnace systems":1.0,"a challenging control problem":1.0,"nonlinear dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781518311944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7518,"joy":0.004,"surprise":0.0261,"sadness":0.0543,"fear":0.0416,"anger":0.0569,"disgust":0.0653},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel control algorithm (GCRA-based 2-DOF PIDA) for electric furnaces that improves temperature regulation, leading to potential energy efficiency gains.

{"id":"science_plos_one_3e29be2c26aa","title":"Stimulation of resistance genes and antioxidant enzymes in lettuce by nano metal oxides against root rot caused by <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>","content":"by Tarek A. Essa, Nashwa A. H. Fetyan, Tamer M. Salem, Nazih Y. Rebouh, Abdelaziz Kishk, Mohamed H. Abdelfattah Root rot, caused by Rhizoctonia solani L., is becoming an increasing issue for lettuce. Nanoparticles (NPs) are emerging as a promising approach for managing biotic stress, offering advantages surpassing traditional control methods. This studyaimed to evaluate the effectiveness of silicon dioxide (SiO2), copper oxide (CuO), and gamma iron oxide (γFe2O3) nanoparticles in inducing systemic resistance (SR) in lettuce against R. solani by examining the molecular response, particularly the expression of pathogenesis-related and stress-regulatory genes. Additionally, assessed total protein contents, photosynthetic pigments, Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant enzymes. The results demonstrated that NPs significantly reduced basal rot symptoms and decreased the Area Under the Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) values. Treated plants also showed increased protein and chlorophyll levels compared to untreated controls. Infected plants showed higher levels of lipid peroxidation (MDA and H2O2). However, treatments with SiO2 and γFe2O3 effectively mitigated the oxidative stress. All NPs enhanced carotenoid content and antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and ascorbate peroxidase [APX]), with γFe2O3 being the most effective. Importantly, NPs induced expression of pathogenesis-related genes, PR1, PR3, and PR4, as well as the Ethylene-Responsive Transcription Factor 1A gene (ERT1). The upregulation of these genes was correlated with reduced disease symptoms and improved physiological status, indicating that enhanced gene expression contributed to the observed systemic resistance. This is the first study to report the fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (FHL) gene activation in lettuce treated with CuO, γFe₂O₃, and SiO₂ nanoparticles against R. solani. These findings suggest that NPs are promising for managing R. solani in lettuce, applicable in both greenhouses and fields by enhancing systemic resistance.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334506","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.067509","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":285,"author":"Mohamed H.

Sahidul Islam, Emanuele Montomoli, Ralf Clemens, Sue Ann Costa Clemens, Mohammad Delwer Hossain Hawlader, Md Foyjul Islam The COVID-19 pandemic has put immense pressure on countries’ health structures to maintain routine immunization and VPD surveillance programs, especially in LMICs such as Bangladesh. Understanding the effects of COVID-19 will allow countries like Bangladesh to become better prepared for future health emergencies, so this study explored the effects of COVID-19 on routine immunization and VPD surveillance programs in Bangladesh. With a sequential mixed-method approach, the quantitative data was collected from the DHIS2 for January 2019-December 2021. The qualitative data was collected from ten KIIs, which was conducted with the key stakeholders of EPI and VPD surveillance in Bangladesh.

The study identified that Bangladesh was able to catch up with the pre-pandemic level immunization within four to six months from the first drop, and the immunization drops became less severe with the progression of time. COVID-19-related movement restrictions, lack of workforce, fear and concern regarding COVID-19, prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination, lack of a comprehensive EPI structure in urban compared to rural areas, and lack of knowledge to conduct EPI and VPD activities amidst the pandemic situation were identified as the main reasons for these drops.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334503","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.067915","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Md Foyjul Islam","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COVID-19","VPD"],"persons":["Tanvir Hossen","Ralf Clemens","Sue Ann Costa Clemens","Emanuele Montomoli","Md Sayik Bin Alam","Md Foyjul","Mohammad Delwer Hossain Hawlader"],"locations":["Bangladesh","Md.","EPI"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1539,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Impact","the COVID","Bangladesh","Md Tanvir Hossen","Md Sayik Bin Alam","Sahidul Islam","Emanuele Montomoli","Ralf Clemens","Sue Ann Costa Clemens","Mohammad Delwer Hossain Hawlader"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Mohammad Delwer Hossain Hawlader"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Impact":2.0,"the COVID":2.0,"Bangladesh":2.0,"Md Tanvir Hossen":1.0,"Md Sayik Bin Alam":1.0,"Sahidul Islam":1.0,"Emanuele Montomoli":1.0,"Ralf Clemens":1.0,"Sue Ann Costa Clemens":1.0,"Mohammad Delwer Hossain Hawlader":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781558069444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4215,"joy":0.0281,"surprise":0.0202,"sadness":0.0274,"fear":0.4696,"anger":0.0258,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on routine immunization programs in Bangladesh using DHIS2 data from January 2019-December 2021 and qualitative data from key stakeholders.

{"id":"science_plos_one_de02f3a5b280","title":"Synergistic effects of sesame oil, extra virgin olive oil, psyllium extract, and dandelion extract on cholesterol gallstone dissolution: An in vitro comparative study against Rowachol<sup>®</sup>","content":"by Raghad Serri, Nada Dehneh, Mohammad Ghannam, Mohamad Radwan Sirri Background Cholesterol gallstones represent a significant global health burden. Current treatments, including surgery and oral dissolution agents, are often invasive or limited by side effects and variable efficacy. This study investigated the in vitro gallstone-dissolving efficacy of a natural combination—sesame oil (SO), extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), psyllium extract (PE), and dandelion extract (DE)—compared to the pharmaceutical agent Rowachol®. Methods In a randomized in vitro study, seventy cholesterol-dominant human gallstones were assigned to seven groups receiving either individual agents, multi-component combinations, or Rowachol® (control). Two prespecified endpoints were assessed under standardized simulated bile conditions at 48 h (T1), 96 h (T2), and 144 h (T3): dissolution rate (DR, %; weight loss) and cumulative cholesterol release (mg). Statistical analyses compared groups across time and explored potential multi-component interactions. Results The four-component regimen (G6: PE + DE+SO+EVOO) showed the greatest efficacy at T3, achieving DR = 92.57% ± 4.2 and cholesterol release = 114.48 ± 4.2 mg, significantly exceeding Rowachol® (39.71% ± 1.9; 42.57 ± 1.9 mg; p < 0.001) and all other groups. Effects were time-dependent, with progressive separation from T1 to T3. Key bioactive compounds—oleic acid, taraxacin, arabinoxylan, and linoleic acid—showed strong positive correlations with dissolution outcomes (r = +0.76 to +0.94). A regression model identified these compounds as primary efficacy predictors, accounting for 94% of the observed variance (adjusted R² = 0.94). Conclusions Under short-term, controlled in vitro conditions, the SO+EVOO+PE + DE combination achieved a ~ 2.3-fold higher dissolution rate than Rowachol® at 144 h. These findings constitute mechanistic, hypothesis-generating evidence that clarifies how dissolution may be enhanced ex vivo. Confirmation in well-designed in-vivo models—followed by clinical studies to evaluate safety, dosing, and effectiveness—is required before any patient-care application.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334496","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.068463","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":291,"author":"Mohamad Radwan Sirri","raw_content_length":2172,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.455,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Nada Dehneh","Mohamad Radwan Sirri Background Cholesterol","Raghad Serri","Mohammad Ghannam","Rowachol®"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2137,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["sesame oil","extra virgin olive oil","psyllium extract","dandelion extract","Synergistic effects","cholesterol gallstone dissolution","An in vitro comparative study","Rowachol","sup","Raghad Serri"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["An in vitro comparative study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"sesame oil":3.0,"extra virgin olive oil":3.0,"psyllium extract":3.0,"dandelion extract":3.0,"Synergistic effects":2.0,"cholesterol gallstone dissolution":2.0,"An in vitro comparative study":2.0,"Rowachol":2.0,"sup":2.0,"Raghad Serri":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7815747325,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.706,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4588,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.628,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.0224,"sadness":0.0614,"fear":0.128,"anger":0.0305,"disgust":0.114},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents in vitro research on gallstone dissolution using natural compounds.

{"id":"science_plos_one_090b90d0255e","title":"A FtsZ inhibitor","content":"by Eric J. Bryan, Zoltan Szekely, Yuxuan Wang, Huizhou Fan, Lucile Moynié, Jacques Y. Roberge, Daniel S. Pilch Multidrug resistance in the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is a global public health threat, highlighting a critical need for drug development. FtsZ is an essential cell division protein that is an appealing target for new antibacterial agents. Benzamide-based FtsZ inhibitors have been developed that exhibit potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens, but poor activity against A. baumannii and other clinically significant Gram-negative pathogens. In this connection, we have initiated a program to enhance activity of benzamide FtsZ inhibitors via conjugation to iron-coordinating siderophore moieties that promote cellular uptake through endogenous bacterial siderophore-iron uptake pathways. Here, we describe a second-generation FtsZ inhibitor-siderophore conjugate (RUP7), in which an oxazole-benzamide FtsZ inhibitor is conjugated to acinetobactin, a principal native siderophore of A. baumannii. In iron-limiting conditions that are typically present at common sites of A. baumannii infection, RUP7 exhibits significantly enhanced activity against a library of A. baumannii clinical isolates relative to the non-conjugated FtsZ inhibitor (RUP2) or a first-generation conjugate (RUP4) in which RUP2 has been conjugated to a chlorocatechol siderophore functionality. This enhanced activity is correlated with markedly improved cellular uptake, perhaps via the BauABCDEF acinetobactin-iron uptake system, the expression of which is highly upregulated in iron-limiting conditions. RUP7 exhibits significant bactericidal synergy against A. baumannii when combined with clinical antibiotics that target penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3 or FtsI), including aztreonam, piperacillin:tazobactam, cefsulodin, and ceftazidime. In the aggregate, our results highlight the combination of design-optimized FtsZ inhibitor-siderophore conjugates and PBP3-targeting antibiotics as an appealing therapeutic strategy for the treatment of A. baumannii infections.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334409","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.070290","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":271,"author":"Daniel S.

Using topic modeling on 59,644 Reddit comments, we identify and analyze key public narratives surrounding the incident, revealing nine topics including the themes of (1) public anger at the profit-driven practices of the insurance industry, (2) support for the shooter, criticism of the CEO, and (3) frustrations over healthcare costs and systemic inefficiencies. Sentiment analysis further shows that discussions are overwhelmingly negative, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction. Empirical analysis demonstrates that corporate characteristics such as profit, revenue growth, and media attention significantly amplify negative CARs, highlighting the market’s sensitivity to perceptions of corporate profit and glamour. High executive compensation, particularly for CEOs, is also associated with more severe stock price declines, suggesting that leadership privileges intensify investor concerns. However, no evidence links CEO narcissism to negative stock impacts, indicating that public focus is more on systemic business practices than individual attitudes. Firms in the ‘Hospital & Medical Service Plans’ segment, including UnitedHealthcare and its peers, experienced the steepest declines immediately after the incident, reflecting heightened public discontent with companies closely tied to essential healthcare services. These findings support the views of ‘social banditry theory and investor sentiment’ and contribute to the broader debate between ‘shareholder vs. stakeholder value maximization’, emphasizing the risks of overlooking societal expectations.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334399","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.070728","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Shantanu Dutta","raw_content_length":1818,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UnitedHealthcare"],"persons":["Chen Li"],"locations":["U.S."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1810,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Delay","defend","Public outrage","health insurance companies","stock market debacle","Chen Li","Moumita Dutta","Jing Duo","This study","the stock markets response"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Delay":2.0,"defend":2.0,"Public outrage":2.0,"health insurance companies":2.0,"stock market debacle":2.0,"Chen Li":1.0,"Moumita Dutta":1.0,"Jing Duo":1.0,"This study":1.0,"the stock markets response":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781622195,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.40700000000000014,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9186,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0099,"joy":0.0007,"surprise":0.0015,"sadness":0.0013,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.9771,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes the stock market's response to a hypothetical event and public sentiment.

{"id":"science_plos_one_0b5163f2d369","title":"Academic discourse on ChatGPT in social sciences: A topic modeling and sentiment analysis of research article abstracts","content":"by Yating Tao, Qian Shen The rapid emergence of ChatGPT has sparked extensive academic discourse across multiple fields. This study focuses on such discourse within the social sciences by examining how scholars frame and evaluate ChatGPT through research article abstracts. Drawing on 1,227 SSCI-indexed abstracts published between 30 November 2022 and 30 November 2024, we adopt a two-step natural language processing approach. First, we apply topic modeling to identify major thematic patterns in academic discussions of ChatGPT. Then, we perform sentiment analysis to examine how scholars’ evaluative attitudes are discursively constructed across these thematic areas. Topic modeling reveals six key themes: artificial intelligence (AI) and technology communication, education and learning tools, user perception and adoption, ethics and academic challenges, human-technology interaction, and computational foundations of Large Language Models (LLMs). Sentiment analysis suggests that approximately 82.97% of abstracts express positive attitudes, particularly regarding ChatGPT’s research potential and pedagogical utility, while around 9.78% reflect more cautious or negative views, often focusing on issues such as academic integrity and misinformation. These sentiment patterns appear to vary across thematic areas, with user adoption and education-related topics showing greater positivity, while ethics-oriented discussions exhibit relatively more critical perspectives. By analyzing academic discourse as reflected in research article abstracts, this study contributes a discourse-level perspective on how ChatGPT is framed, endorsed, and critically examined in the social sciences. It offers a data-driven complement to existing conceptual and survey-based investigations and draws attention to both the thematic and evaluative tendencies shaping scholarly narratives around generative AI.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334331","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.071626","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Qian Shen","raw_content_length":1907,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Qian Shen","Yating Tao"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1899,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ChatGPT","social sciences","analysis","research article","Yating Tao","The rapid emergence","extensive academic discourse","multiple fields","This study","such discourse"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["ChatGPT"],"research_academic":["social sciences","research article","extensive academic discourse","This study"],"business_innovation":["analysis"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ChatGPT":4.0,"social sciences":2.0,"analysis":2.0,"research article":2.0,"Yating Tao":1.0,"The rapid emergence":1.0,"extensive academic discourse":1.0,"multiple fields":1.0,"This study":1.0,"such discourse":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781654016388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8169,"joy":0.0187,"surprise":0.0175,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0523,"anger":0.0633,"disgust":0.0276},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article analyzes academic discourse on ChatGPT.

The study aimed to quantify the kinematic adjustments at individual joints and end-points of the pelvis-leg apparatus in older adults during cognitive-motor dual task involved crossing obstacles of varying heights while performing serial subtraction. Methods Sixteen healthy older adults each walked and crossed obstacle of three varying heights with leading and trailing limb under single-task and dual-task conditions. Toe-obstacle clearances and pelvic and lower limb angular motions were calculated. Two-way analyses of variance were conducted to study within-subject (task and height) effects on the variables. Results Older adults showed significantly reduced crossing speed and increased leading and trailing toe-obstacle clearances. During dual-task obstacle crossing, there were increased pelvic anterior tilt, swing hip abduction and knee flexion, but decreased stance hip adduction at leading-limb crossing, compared to single-task (p < 0.05). There were increased in pelvic posterior tilt and swing knee flexion, but decreased pelvic upward list, stance hip adduction and stance knee flexion during dual-task obstacle crossing at trailing-limb crossing (p < 0.05). Discussion and implications The study found healthy older adults showed reduced crossing speed and adapting behaviour, with distinct kinematic changes at the pelvis, hip, and knee joints, leading to increased toe-obstacle clearances.
