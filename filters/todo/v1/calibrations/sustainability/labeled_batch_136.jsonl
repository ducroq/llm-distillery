One of the key observations is that polymer exhibit faster dynamics compared to passive colloidal particles at high activity, for the same particle density, in both linear and star polymer topologies. This enhanced motion is attributed to the accumulation of active particles, which induces prolonged and persistent movement of the polymer. Further analysis reveals that star polymers exhibit more complex and intriguing behavior than their linear counterparts. Notably, the accumulation of active particles promotes the pairing of arms in star polymers. For instance, a three-armed star polymer adopts a conformation similar to a linear polymer with two-arms due to this pairing as a result, at high activity, the dynamics of both the polymers converge. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a linear polymer with the same total number of beads as the star polymer. Interestingly, at high activity -- where arm pairing in the star polymer is significant -- the star polymer demonstrates faster dynamics than the linear polymer, despite having the identical number of beads. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interactions between active and passive components of varying topologies in dilute systems and highlight their potential for innovative applications ranging from materials science to biomedicine.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11337","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.727961","language":"en","tags":["cond-matsoft","physicsbio-ph","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Ramanand Singh Yadav, Ralf Metzler, Rajarshi Chakrabarti","raw_content_length":1568,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":["arXiv:2510.11337v1 Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1567,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["different topologies","Behavior","passive polymeric tracers","a dilute bath","active Brownian particles","arXiv251011337v1 Announce Type","cross","computer simulations","two dimensions","the dynamics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"different topologies":3.0,"Behavior":2.0,"passive polymeric tracers":2.0,"a dilute bath":2.0,"active Brownian particles":2.0,"arXiv251011337v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"computer simulations":1.0,"two dimensions":1.0,"the dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7759101383333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9001,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8209,"joy":0.0314,"surprise":0.0632,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0089,"anger":0.0141,"disgust":0.052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes computer simulations of active and passive polymers.

This limit is defined on the assumption of a one-port system, generally causing duality symmetry to be overlooked. Here, we define a generalized causality constraint of sound absorption by investigating reflection and transmission of a two-port hybrid monopole-dipole resonator. With our theory, we show that the absorption limit is approached by relying on the well-established critical coupling as well as by matching effective compressibility and density. We experimentally show that the designed resonator absorbance follows the duality symmetry condition embodied in the large bandwidth reported. A comparison with a traditional foam liner and other competitive works further validates our findings, confirming an intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality.

Despite its importance, the upper bounds of enhancement under these constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to predict the fundamental limits of intensity enhancement with phase-only modulation in the presence of noise-induced phase errors, and we experimentally demonstrate wavefront shaping that approaches these limits. Our experimental results confirm an enhancement factor of 5,000 in a large-core multimode fiber, approaching the theoretical upper bound, enabled by noise-tolerant wavefront shaping.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms.

One such detector is the ALICE ITS3 that aims to be very light at 0.07% X/X$_{0}$ per layer and have a low power consumption in the active area of 40 mW/cm$^{2}$ by implementing wafer-scale MAPS bent into cylindrical half layers. To address these challenging requirements, the ALICE ITS3 project, in conjunction with the CERN EP R&D on monolithic pixel sensors, proposed the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co. 65 nm CMOS process as the starting point for the sensor. After the initial results confirmed the detection efficiency and radiation hardness, the choice of the technology was solidified by demonstrating the feasibility of operating MAPS in low-power consumption regimes, < 50 mW/cm$^{2}$, while maintaining high-quality performance. This was shown through a detailed characterisation of the Digital Pixel Test Structure (DPTS) prototype exposed to X-rays and ionising beams, and the results are presented in this article. Additionally, the sensor was further investigated through studies of the fake-hit rate, the linearity of the front-end in the range 1.7-28 keV, the performance after ionising irradiation, and the detection efficiency of inclined tracks in the range 0-45$^\\circ$.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05867","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.746228","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsins-det","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Gianluca Aglieri Rinella, Nicole Apadula, Anton Andronic, Matias Antonelli, Mauro Aresti, Roberto Baccomi, Pascal Becht, Stefania Beole, Marcello Borri, Justus Braach, Matthew Daniel Buckland, Eric Buschmann, Paolo Camerini, Francesca Carnesecchi, Leonardo Cecconi, Edoardo Charbon, Giacomo Contin, Dominik Dannheim, Joao de Melo, Wenjing Deng, Antonello di Mauro, Jan Hasenbichler, Hartmut Hillemanns, Geun Hee Hong, Artem Isakov, Hangil Jang, Antoine Junique, Minjung Kim, Alex Kluge, Artem Kotliarov, Filip K\\v{r}\\'i\\v{z}ek, Lukas Lautner, Sanghoon Lim, Magnus Mager, Davide Marras, Paolo Martinengo, Silvia Masciocchi, Marius Wilm Menzel, Magdalena Munker, Francesco Piro, Alexandre Rachevski, Karoliina Rebane, Felix Reidt, Roberto Russo, Isabella Sanna, Valerio Sarritzu, Serhiy Senyukov, Walter Snoeys, Jory Sonneveld, Miljenko \\v{S}ulji\\'c, Peter Svihra, Nicolas Tiltmann, Vittorio Di Trapani, Gianluca Usai, Jacob Bastiaan Van Beelen, Mirella Dimitrova Vassilev, Caterina Vernieri, Anna Villani","raw_content_length":1364,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MAPS","CMOS","ALICE","the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co.","CMOS Process arXiv:2505.05867v2 Announce Type: replace"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1359,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Further Characterisation","Digital Pixel Test Structures","a 65 nm CMOS Process","arXiv250505867v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The next generation","MAPS","future tracking detectors","stringent requirements","them"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Further Characterisation":2.0,"Digital Pixel Test Structures":2.0,"a 65 nm CMOS Process":2.0,"arXiv250505867v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The next generation":1.0,"MAPS":1.0,"future tracking detectors":1.0,"stringent requirements":1.0,"them":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7763753930555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8802,"joy":0.0132,"surprise":0.0502,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0129,"anger":0.0264,"disgust":0.0106},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents research on a low-power CMOS sensor for particle detection, specifically targeting the ALICE ITS3 project.

Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\\Delta\\hat\\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \\times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector.

Along-track wavenumber spectra of SSH variance are estimated for the global ocean using the 1-day repeat period from March 26 to July 10, 2023. In regions with an energetic mesoscale eddy field, the spectra have a mesoscale plateau, a steep drop-off due to balanced submesoscale turbulence, and a much flatter power-law tail at small scales. These spectra are characterized by fitting a spectral model. For the balanced signal, this fit yields a power law exponent between -4 and -6 for most regions, broadly consistent with expectations and previous observations. The amplitude of the distinct small-scale signal, which typically dominates at wavelengths less than 30 to 50 km, is strongly correlated in time and space with the height of surface gravity waves, suggesting aliased wave signals as the most likely source. A simple method is proposed to isolate the balanced signal in regions with negligible internal tides. Maps of the balanced signal in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current show compact cyclones with geostrophic relative vorticities frequently in excess of the local planetary vorticity, challenging the quasi-geostrophic framework commonly used to interpret altimetric data.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09856","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.747057","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsao-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Xihan Zhang, J\\\"orn Callies","raw_content_length":1414,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SSH","Surface Water"],"persons":["Announce Type","Ocean Topography"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1413,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["submesoscale sea surface height signals","the SWOT mission","Announce Type","Abstract","The sea surface height","SSH field","Surface Water","SWOT","a focus","submesoscale features"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"submesoscale sea surface height signals":2.0,"the SWOT mission":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The sea surface height":1.0,"SSH field":1.0,"Surface Water":1.0,"SWOT":1.0,"a focus":1.0,"submesoscale features":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776407415,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.856,"joy":0.0103,"surprise":0.0895,"sadness":0.01,"fear":0.0106,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article analyzes data from the deployed SWOT mission, focusing on submesoscale sea surface height features.

The raw performance, power efficiency and data storage requirements of the software was evaluated for each HPC facility, along with qualitative factors such as the user experience and software environment. It was found that the diversity of methods used within computational biology means that there is no single HPC hardware that can optimally run every type of HPC job, and that diverse hardware is the only way to properly support all methods. New hardware, such as AMD GPUs and Nvidia AI chips, are mostly compatible with existing methods, but are also more labour-intensive to support. GPUs offer the most efficient way to run most computational biology tasks, though some tasks still require CPUs. A fast HPC node running molecular dynamics can produce around 10GB of data per day, however, most facilities and research institutions lack short-term and long-term means to store this data.

A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre-existing narrowband wave field until it breaks, transferring energy into the water column. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field resumes growth. We separately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking-induced dissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and turbulent dissipation during breaking. Wind input during growth is balanced with dissipation during breaking over an entire growing-breaking cycle. The wave growth rate scales with $(u_\\ast/c)^2$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering, and the energy dissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking, confirming the universality of the process.

Spatial variations of the diffusion gradients make diffusion weightings and directions non-uniform across the field of view, and deform perfect shells in the q-space designed for isotropic directional coverage. Such imperfections hinder parameter estimation: Anisotropic shells hamper the deconvolution of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), while brute-force retraining of a nonlinear regressor for each unique set of directions and diffusion weightings is computationally inefficient. Here we propose a protocol-independent parameter estimation (PIPE) method that enables fast parameter estimation for the most general case where the scan in each voxel is acquired with a different protocol in q-space. PIPE applies for any spherical convolution-based dMRI model, irrespective of its complexity, which makes it suitable both for white and gray matter in the brain or spinal cord, and for other tissues where fiber bundles have the same properties within a voxel (fiber response), but are distributed with an arbitrary fODF. Applied to in vivo human MRI with linear tensor encoding on a high-performance system, PIPE maps fiber response and fODF parameters for the whole brain in the presence of significant gradient nonlinearities in under 3 minutes. PIPE enables fast parameter estimation in the presence of arbitrary gradient nonlinearities, eliminating the need to arrange dMRI in shells or to retrain the estimator for different protocols in each voxel. PIPE applies for any model based on a convolution of a voxel-wise fiber response and fODF, and data from varying b-values, diffusion/echo times, and other scan parameters.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22650","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.750119","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsmed-ph","physicsbio-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Santiago Coelho, Gregory Lemberskiy, Ante Zhu, Hong-Hsi Lee, Nastaren Abad, Thomas K.

We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with a computationally efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics. Through two illustrative examples, we conduct initial-value simulations that show that, as the stiffness of the filament is decreased, the dynamic behaviour moves from rigid motion to planar buckling, through an out-of-plane transition, eventually reaching diffusive-like behaviours for very deformable filaments.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03586","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.750968","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","cond-matsoft","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Matthew D Butler, Benjamin J Walker, Thomas Montenegro-Johnson, Panayiota Katsamba","raw_content_length":1313,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1312,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Elastohydrodynamics","chemically active filaments","arXiv250703586v2 Announce Type","Active deformable filaments","a large range","qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics","their flexibility","the active forcing","the dynamic behaviour","phoretic filaments"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Elastohydrodynamics":2.0,"chemically active filaments":2.0,"arXiv250703586v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Active deformable filaments":1.0,"a large range":1.0,"qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics":1.0,"their flexibility":1.0,"the active forcing":1.0,"the dynamic behaviour":1.0,"phoretic filaments":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776537746111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.734,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9468,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8163,"joy":0.0305,"surprise":0.1006,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.0106,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.013},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical model of chemically active filaments and their dynamic behavior.

While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \\propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12585","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.752217","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","nlinao","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Matheus S.

The model assumes that the zonal perturbations grow at a rate twice that of the original (pump) wave, consistent with a beat-driven (or force-driven) generation mechanism. The evolution and saturation of the mode amplitude are investigated both analytically and numerically within our reduced model assumptions, in both the collisionless and scattering-dominated regimes. These studies underscore the crucial role of sources and sinks in accurately capturing the impact and the role of beat-driven zonal perturbations on mode evolution. In the realistic case of saturation set by sources and sinks, we discuss the role of a finite amplitude zonal mode in reducing microturbulent particle scattering, thus limiting the energy source for the resonant mode. We then discuss comparisons between the model predictions and simulation results. The model reproduces key features observed in gyrokinetic simulations as the reduction in saturated mode amplitude and the onset of wave-wave nonlinear effects as functions of mode growth rate and amplitude. Thanks to its simplicity, it can be readily implemented into codes based on reduced models, thereby improving their predictive capability for strongly driven instabilities.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19393","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.753661","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsplasm-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Tommaso Barberis, Vin\\'icius N.

Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15741","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.755314","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Ilya V.

Velocity field and spatial distribution of particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system. The temperature distribution is measured in many locations using a temperature probe equipped with 12 E - thermocouples. In the forced convection, the gradients of the mean temperature field and the particle number density in the horizontal direction in the core flow are much stronger than in the vertical direction. The mean fluid velocity structure show transition between a single-roll pattern for isothermal turbulence to double-roll patterns with increase of the temperature difference between the bottom and upper walls of the chamber. For larger temperature differences, the mean fluid velocity structure returns to a single-roll pattern. In the turbulent regions with large mean temperature gradients, the dominant effect of the large-scale particle clustering is turbulent thermal diffusion, resulting in that the maximum of the mean particle number density is located in the regions with minimum of the mean temperature and vise versa. Deviations from this feature is observed in the regions with strong mean fluid velocities where the mean temperature gradients are small.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18865","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.756140","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"E.

Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law.

Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\\epsilon(k) = \\text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \\geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01782","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.757362","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","physicsatom-ph","physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Yidan Wang, Xuesen Na, Michael J.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_1da1d35362e7","title":"Learning Selection Cuts With Gradients","content":"arXiv:2502.08615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Many analyses in high-energy physics rely on selection thresholds (cuts) applied to detector, particle, or event properties. Initial cut values can often be guessed from physical intuition, but cut optimization, especially for multiple features, is commonly performed by hand, or skipped entirely in favor of multivariate algorithms like BDTs or neural networks. We revisit this problem, and develop a cut optimization approach based on gradient descent. Cut thresholds are learned as parameters of a network with a simple architecture, and can be tuned to achieve a target signal efficiency through the use of custom loss functions.

In ultracold gases, these correlations are quantified by the contact parameter, yet measurements to date have been limited to equilibrium systems or relatively slow, global dynamics. Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects.

In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system.

We aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of UL and DL communications through joint optimization of BS, AIRS beamforming, and AIRS element allocation. First, we study three deployment schemes, namely distributed AIRSs, BS-side AIRS, and user-side AIRS. For distributed AIRSs, both optimal and near-optimal solutions are derived in closed form. To draw useful insights, we analytically compare the deployment schemes in terms of the rate performance under the single-user setup. For the multi-user case, we consider two beamforming setups at the distributed AIRSs to balance performance and complexity tradeoffs. Regarding the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, different AIRS beamforming vectors are adopted for each user; while for the static AIRS beamforming, all users share the same beamforming vectors, with identical phase shifts but different amplitudes for UL and DL. With the user-adaptive AIRS beamforming, we focus on the optimization of element allocation for rate maximization.

Specifically, a base station (BS) equipped with multiple PRAs at both the transmitter and the receiver aims to sense the unknown and random angular location parameter of a point target via sending wireless signals and processing the received echo signals reflected by the target, where only prior distribution information about the location parameter is available for exploitation. Firstly, we characterize the sensing performance of this novel PRA-based MIMO radar system by deriving the Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) of the mean-squared error (MSE) in estimating the desired location parameter with prior distribution information. Then, to fully exploit the new design degrees-of-freedom (DoF) empowered by PRAs, we study the joint optimization of the transmit sample covariance matrix as well as the transmit and receive phase shift vectors to minimize the sensing BCRB subject to a transmit power constraint. This problem is non-convex and difficult to solve due to the coupling among optimization variables. To resolve this issue, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm which iteratively obtains the closed-form optimal solution to each variable with the others being fixed at each time, thus being guaranteed to converge to at least a stationary point of the joint optimization problem.

To address this issue, this study employed the unified graph representation matrix (UGRM) to propose a generalized graph Fourier transform (UGRM-GFT) method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for signal analysis on directed graphs and Cartesian product graphs. We defined UGRM-GFT for general directed graphs by introducing a parameterized UGRM that incorporates traditional representations such as the Laplacian matrix and adjacency matrix. The SVD is used to construct spectral transform pairs with both left and right singular vectors. We extended this approach to two types of UGRM-GFTs applied to directed Cartesian product graphs. UGRM-GFT-I performs SVD directly on the composite UGRM matrix of the two-dimensional graph structure, suitable for globally coupled graph signals. UGRM-GFT-II separately applies SVD to the UGRMs of the two-factor graphs and then combines the results, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving spectral expressiveness. Theoretical analysis confirmed the monotonicity of the proposed method with respect to the parameters alpha and k embedded in the UGRM. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional fixed-matrix approaches in denoising tasks, with a particular emphasis on signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth efficiency.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10532","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.689839","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Guoyun Xie, Zhichao Zhang","raw_content_length":1597,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SVD","UGRM"],"persons":["Fourier"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1596,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SVD","arXiv251010532v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Traditional directed graph signal processing","fixed representation matrices","whose rigid structures","the models ability","complex graph topologies","this issue","this study"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["this study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SVD":3.0,"arXiv251010532v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Traditional directed graph signal processing":1.0,"fixed representation matrices":1.0,"whose rigid structures":1.0,"the models ability":1.0,"complex graph topologies":1.0,"this issue":1.0,"this study":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7776650241666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8529,"joy":0.0215,"surprise":0.071,"sadness":0.0141,"fear":0.0167,"anger":0.0178,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (UGRM-GFT) for signal processing on directed graphs, showing improved performance in denoising tasks based on signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth efficiency.

Most existing channel prediction and predictive beamforming methods are limited by model generalization capabilities and struggle to adapt to time-varying wireless propagation environments. Inspired by the remarkable generalization and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this work proposes an LLM-based channel prediction framework, namely CPLLM, to forecast future channel state information (CSI) for LEO satellites based on historical CSI data. In the proposed CPLLM, a dedicated CSI encoder is designed to map raw CSI data into the textual embedding space, effectively bridging the modality gap and enabling the LLM to perform reliable reasoning over CSI data. Additionally, a CSI decoder is introduced to simultaneously predict CSI for multiple future time slots, substantially reducing the computational burden and inference latency associated with the inherent autoregressive decoding process of LLMs. Then, instead of training the LLM from scratch, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, for CPLLM, where the pretrained LLM remains frozen and trainable low-rank matrices are injected into each Transformer decoder layer to enable effective fine-tuning. Furthermore, we extend CPLLM to directly generate beamforming strategies for future time slots based on historical CSI data, namely BFLLM. This extended framework retains the same architecture as CPLLM, while introducing a dedicated beamforming decoder to output beamforming strategies. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in channel prediction and predictive beamforming for LEO satellite communications.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10561","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.691092","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Zhixiong Chen, Hyundong Shin, Arumugam Nallanathan, Jonathon Chambers","raw_content_length":1899,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","LEO","CSI"],"persons":["Language Model"],"locations":["Earth","LEO"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1898,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Large Language Model","Announce Type","new Abstract","Accurate channel prediction","effective beamforming","low Earth orbit","LEO satellite communications","system capacity","high-speed connectivity","Most existing channel prediction"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Large Language Model":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Accurate channel prediction":1.0,"effective beamforming":1.0,"low Earth orbit":1.0,"LEO satellite communications":1.0,"system capacity":1.0,"high-speed connectivity":1.0,"Most existing channel prediction":1.0}},"age_hours":2.777707075,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7931,"joy":0.0262,"surprise":0.112,"sadness":0.0104,"fear":0.0415,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0029},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new method for channel prediction and beamforming in LEO satellite communications using LLMs. The concrete action is the development of CPLLM and BFLLM frameworks, validated through simulations.

Conventional beamforming suffers from sidelobe interference, adaptive methods (e.g., MVDR) and subspace algorithms (e.g., MUSIC) degrade with limited snapshots or coherent signals, while sparse-recovery approaches (e.g., L1-SVD) incur high computational complexity for large arrays. In this article, we construct the concept of the optimal spatial filter to solve the DOA estimation problem under demanding conditions by utilizing the sparsity of spatial signals. By utilizing the concept of the optimal spatial filter, we have transformed the DOA estimation problem into a solution problem for the optimal spatial filter. We propose the Spatial Signal Focusing and Noise Suppression (SSFNS) algorithm, which is a novel DOA estimation framework grounded in the theoretical existence of an optimal spatial filter, to solve for the optimal spatial filter and obtain DOA. Through experiments, it was found that the proposed algorithm is suitable for large aperture two-dimensional arrays and experiments have shown that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms in scenarios with few snapshots or even a single snapshot, low signal-to-noise ratio, coherent signals, and unknown signal numbers in two-dimensional large aperture arrays.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10923","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.695671","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Xuyao Deng, Yong Dou, Kele Xu","raw_content_length":1509,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MUSIC","MVDR","the Spatial Signal Focusing","Spatial Signal Focusing","DOA","L1-SVD"],"persons":["Noise Suppres"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1508,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Spatial Signal Focusing","Noise Suppression","Direction","arXiv251010923v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Arrival","sensor arrays","limitations","conditions","noise"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Spatial Signal Focusing":2.0,"Noise Suppression":2.0,"Direction":2.0,"arXiv251010923v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Arrival":1.0,"sensor arrays":1.0,"limitations":1.0,"conditions":1.0,"noise":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7778711386111112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.34150000000000014,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9317,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.78,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0369,"sadness":0.0511,"fear":0.0202,"anger":0.0315,"disgust":0.0766},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm (SSFNS) for DOA estimation, which could improve the efficiency of sensor arrays.

This survey explores the security implications of RIS in next-generation wireless networks. We first highlight the dual-use nature of RIS, demonstrating how its communication-enhancing capabilities can be exploited by adversaries to compromise legitimate users. We identify a new class of security vulnerabilities termed ``passive-active hybrid attacks,'' where RIS, despite passively handling signals, can be reconfigured to actively engage in malicious activities, enabling various RIS-assisted attacks, such as eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, reflection jamming, and side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we reveal how adversaries can exploit the openness of wireless channels to introduce adversarial perturbations in artificial intelligence-driven RIS networks, disrupting communication terminals and causing misclassifications or errors in RIS reflection predictions. Despite these risks, RIS technology also plays a critical role in enhancing security and privacy across radio frequency (RF) and visible light communication (VLC) systems. By synthesizing current insights and highlighting emerging threats, we provide actionable insights into cross-layer collaboration, advanced adversarial defenses, and the balance between security and cost.

The AF of each waveform is obtained directly from its discrete-time definition and enhanced via ideal fractional interpolation, enabling precise characterization of its continuous-time delay-Doppler response. Two signaling modes are examined: a communication-oriented case with random information symbols suitable only for monostatic scenarios, and a sensing-oriented case with fixed unimodular symbols suitable for general multi-static scenarios. Furthermore, the AFs and the ambiguity metrics including the 3dB mainlobe width, peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR), and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR), are evaluated in normalized delay-Doppler units, enabling direct translation to any physical system configuration defined by bandwidth, sampling frequency, or symbol duration, while ensuring straightforward and consistent comparison across waveforms. The results establish a consistent benchmark for comparing waveform sensing capabilities in ISAC design, consolidating known behaviors: OFDM exhibits excellent delay resolution and sidelobe behavior but poor Doppler response, whereas advanced waveforms achieve improved balance between delay and Doppler resolution with varying sidelobe characteristics. The simulation code of the smooth AFs, is openly shared to promote reproducibility and support future ISAC waveform research.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11216","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.699720","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu","raw_content_length":1842,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OTFS","CP arXiv:2510.11216v1 Announce Type:","OFDM"],"persons":["Doppler"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1841,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["OFDM","OTFS","AFDM","Normalized Ambiguity Function Characteristics","arXiv251011216v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","a unified and system-agnostic analysis","the ambiguity function","AF characteristics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"OFDM":3.0,"OTFS":3.0,"AFDM":3.0,"Normalized Ambiguity Function Characteristics":2.0,"arXiv251011216v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a unified and system-agnostic analysis":1.0,"the ambiguity function":1.0,"AF characteristics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7780125936111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8919,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.0185,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0293,"anger":0.0262,"disgust":0.0201},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the ambiguity function characteristics of different multicarrier waveforms for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in 6G networks.

The proposed framework identifies user-specific, resource element-wise PDP factors and develops a deep neural network-based SIP receiver comprising explicit channel estimation and data detection components. To properly leverage path gain data, we devise an embedding generator that projects it into embeddings, which are then fused with intermediate feature maps of the channel estimation network.

Suppose the RSU notices that a particular car in its visual field needs to execute a specific evasive maneuver to avoid danger. It would like to send a packet addressed to that particular car with this suggestion. The problem is that while all the cars are communicating with the RSU, the RSU does not know which car in the video is associated with what IP address. So, it does not know which IP address to send the packet to. Indeed, the problem of matching addresses with cars in the visual field is a fundamental open problem. We provide an active solution employing dynamic watermarking that was originally developed for the security of cyber-physical systems. This technique calls for a car to superpose a small random excitation onto its actuation commands for steering angle or throttle/brake positions. The car sends this random waveform to the RSU in a packet containing its IP address. By signal processing of the video stream of a car at the RSU it can verify whether it matches with the waveform in the packet and thereby associates that the IP address of the packet with that car in the visual field. The RSU thereby determines which IP address is associated with which car in its visual field. We present two demonstrations of performance. We demonstrate experimental results on a laboratory transportation automated vehicles, a vision system, and a network, as well as on the field with two passenger sedans in practice. The results demonstrate that employing the dynamic watermarking method enables an RSU to distinguish the communication of a target vehicle from that of other IP addresses of nearby vehicles.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11353","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.702174","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":296,"author":"Woo-Hyun Ko, Jaewon Kim, Tzu-Hsiang Lin, Samin Moosavi, P.

It is commonly utilized in signal processing to describe unknown additive noise in a system and is often justified by citing the central limit theorem for sums of random variables, although the central limit theorem applies only to sums of independent identically distributed random variables. However, many linear operations in signal processing take the form of weighted sums, which transforms the random variables such that their distributions are no longer identical. One such operation is a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. FIR filters are commonly used in signal processing applications as a pre-processing step. FIR output noise is generally assumed to be Gaussian. This article examines the FIR output response in the presence of uniformly distributed quantization noise. We express the FIR output uncertainty in terms of the input quantization uncertainty and filter coefficients. We show that the output uncertainty cannot be assumed to be Gaussian, but depending on the application a Gaussian estimation may still be useful. Then, we show through detailed numerical simulations that the output uncertainty distribution of the filter can be estimated through its most dominant coefficients.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11384","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.703368","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Jennie Couchman, Phillip Stanley-Marbell","raw_content_length":1368,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FIR"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1367,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Uncertainty Propagation","Finite Impulse Response Filters","the Gaussian Assumption","signal processing","sums","arXiv251011384v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A common assumption","underlying data","a Gaussian distribution"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Uncertainty Propagation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Uncertainty Propagation":2.0,"Finite Impulse Response Filters":2.0,"the Gaussian Assumption":2.0,"signal processing":2.0,"sums":2.0,"arXiv251011384v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A common assumption":1.0,"underlying data":1.0,"a Gaussian distribution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7781465394444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8017,"joy":0.03,"surprise":0.0506,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0445,"anger":0.0338,"disgust":0.0332},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on the theoretical analysis of FIR filters and their output uncertainty in the presence of quantization noise.

The successful onboard implantation of the proposed framework on a Raspberry-pi-4 microcontroller indicates its potential as a standalone clinical system for ILD screening in a real clinical scenario.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11458","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.706452","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","systems","eessas","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Soubhagya Ranjan Hota, Arka Roy, Udit Satija","raw_content_length":1229,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ILD-VIT","ILD","BRACETS","VIT"],"persons":["mel spectrogram"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1228,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ILD","arXiv251011458v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Interstitial lung disease","a group","restrictive chronic pulmonary diseases","oxygen acquisition","irreversible changes","the lungs","fibrosis"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["oxygen acquisition"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ILD":3.0,"arXiv251011458v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Interstitial lung disease":1.0,"a group":1.0,"restrictive chronic pulmonary diseases":1.0,"oxygen acquisition":1.0,"irreversible changes":1.0,"the lungs":1.0,"fibrosis":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7782590566666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8567,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.0493,"sadness":0.0274,"fear":0.0188,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.0253},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a deep learning framework for detecting interstitial lung disease (ILD) using respiratory sound recordings.

{"id":"science_arxiv_eess_3dc78d0e9898","title":"Bayesian Self","content":"arXiv:2510.11628v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is essential for both high-rate communication and high-precision sensing in 6G wireless systems. However, a major performance limitation arises from calibration mismatches when operating phased-array antennas under real-world conditions. To address this issue, we propose to integrate antenna element self-calibration into a variational sparse Bayesian learning (VSBL) algorithm for parametric channel estimation. We model antenna gain and phase deviations as latent variables and derive explicit update equations to jointly infer these calibration parameters and the channel parameters: the model order, complex amplitudes, delays, angles, and the noise variance. The resulting algorithm operates online and adapts in real time to hardware-induced mismatches. We assess its performance in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the optimal subpattern-assignment (OSPA) metric, demonstrating consistent improvements over conventional VSBL without calibration. Our results demonstrate that embedding self-calibration within Bayesian inference significantly enhances the robustness of channel estimation.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11628","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.709787","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Patrick H\\\"odl, Jakob M\\\"oderl, Erik Leitinger, Klaus Witrisal","raw_content_length":1187,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VSBL","OSPA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1186,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bayesian Self","arXiv251011628v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Accurate channel estimation","both high-rate communication","high-precision sensing","6G wireless systems","a major performance limitation","calibration mismatches","phased-array antennas"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bayesian Self":2.0,"arXiv251011628v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Accurate channel estimation":1.0,"both high-rate communication":1.0,"high-precision sensing":1.0,"6G wireless systems":1.0,"a major performance limitation":1.0,"calibration mismatches":1.0,"phased-array antennas":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778373797222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.2169999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3566,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9122,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0413,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0121,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm for channel estimation in 6G wireless systems, improving robustness through self-calibration.
