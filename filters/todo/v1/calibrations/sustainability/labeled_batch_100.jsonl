In een speech op Facebook zei president Rajoelina dat hij zijn land is ontvlucht omdat hij vreest voor zijn leven. Zondag zei de president al dat er een poging tot staatsgreep gaande was, nadat een elite-eenheid van het leger zich bij demonstrerende jongeren had aangesloten. De demonstraties begonnen uit onvrede over de gebrekkige water- en elektriciteitsvoorziening op het eiland, maar richten zich inmiddels op corruptie bij de regering. De betogers eisen het vertrek van Rajoelina, die sinds 2019 aan de macht is. Rajoelina ging daar in zijn toespraak niet op in, maar zei dat hij niet zal toestaan dat Madagaskar wordt vernietigd. Hij riep iedereen op om de grondwet te respecteren en sprak met geen woord over aftreden. Het is niet bekend waar de president nu is. Mogelijk is hij met een Frans militair toestel naar een ander land gebracht.

De jury noemt haar boek Die Holländerinnen (de Nederlandse vrouwen) \"een fascinerende reis naar het hart van de duisternis\". Het boek gaat over een schrijfster die met een theatergroep door de Zuid-Amerikaanse jungle trekt, in de voetsporen van twee Nederlandse vrouwen die daar jaren geleden verdwenen. Het verhaal is gedeeltelijk gebaseerd op de verdwijning en het overlijden van de Nederlandse Kris Kremers en Lisanne Froon, in 2014 in Panama. Draaikolk van angst \"Hoe dieper de groep afdwaalt in het oerwoud, hoe meer Elmiger de lezer meesleurt in een draaikolk van angst\", aldus de jury. Het boek is nog niet in het Nederlands vertaald.

Het winnende gesprek komt uit het HUMAN-programma Over Leven, waarin Verbraak sprak met voormalig strafrechtadvocaat Bram Moszkowicz. Volgens de jury weet Verbraak precies wanneer hij gas moet geven en wanneer hij moet zwijgen. \"Het resultaat is een gesprek over eer, verlies en zelfbeeld, menselijker dan je zou verwachten bij zo'n juridisch zwaargewicht.\" Het laatste gesprek van Tim Hofman met de vorig jaar overleden Eva Hermans-Kroot voor Over Mijn Lijk eindigde op de tweede plaats. \"Het gaat over afscheid en verlies, maar er is ook ruimte voor lichtheid, humor en waardigheid. Juist die combinatie maakt het gesprek zo krachtig en indringend\", aldus de jury. De Sonja Barend Award is een initiatief van de VARAgids en werd uitgereikt in het BNNVARA-programma Pauw & De Wit. In de televisiegids zegt Verbraak dat hij er niet op had gerekend dat hij voor de derde keer de prijs zou winnen. \"Het is heel eervol om weer een keer in een zin genoemd te worden met Sonja Barend.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_f625ee74807e","title":"Alle levende gijzelaars terug in Israël, top over toekomst Gaza: dit gebeurde er maandag","content":"\"Een nieuw tijdperk van vrede\" en \"het begin van een nieuw Midden-Oosten\". Zo typeerde de Amerikaanse president Trump de dag waarop de twintig nog levende gijzelaars herenigd werden met hun families in Israël en bijna 2000 Palestijnen uit Israëlische gevangenissen werden vrijgelaten. Trump sprak vanmiddag de Knesset, het Israëlische parlement, toe over zijn twintigpuntenplan dat tot de wapenstilstand tussen Israël en Hamas heeft geleid. Ook vertelde hij hoe de Israëlische \"overwinning op terroristen\" moet uitmonden in vrede en welvaart voor het Midden-Oosten. Hij bedankte daarbij premier Netanyahu en ook Arabische landen en de islamitische wereld, die volgens hem druk op Hamas hebben uitgeoefend om de gijzelaars vrij te laten. 738 dagen Naar die vrijlating werd vanochtends al heel vroeg uitgekeken door de duizenden Israëliërs die zich op het 'Gijzelaarsplein' in Tel Aviv hadden verzameld. Op dat plein tikte een speciale klok vandaag 738 dagen aan sinds 251 gijzelaars op 7 oktober 2023 door terreurorganisatie Hamas werden ontvoerd naar Gaza. Gespannen werd uitgekeken naar het moment dat een eerste groep gijzelaars aan het Rode Kruis zou worden overgedragen. Toen dat even na 07.00 uur gebeurde, was de ontlading groot. Op het plein werd gejuicht, geklapt en gezongen. De eerste zeven vrijgelaten gijzelaars arriveerden rond 08.30 uur op Israëlisch grondgebied. Zij werden eerst naar de militaire basis Re'im aan de rand van de Gazastrook gebracht voor de hereniging met hun families. Daarna werden de mannen doorgevlogen naar ziekenhuizen elders in Israël om aan te sterken. Zo zagen die herenigingen eruit: Rond het moment dat de eerste gijzelaars terugkeerden landde president Trump met zijn regeringsvliegtuig op de luchthaven van Tel Aviv. Samen met first lady Melania Trump, speciaal gezant Steve Witkoff, zijn dochter Ivanka Trump en schoonzoon Jared Kushner werd hij ontvangen door de Israëlische president Herzog en premier Netanyahu. Terwijl hij met families van gijzelaars sprak, werd kort na 10.00 uur de resterende groep van dertien nog levende gijzelaars vrijgelaten door Hamas. Wie zijn de vrijgelaten gijzelaars? Onder de twintig mannen die vandaag werden vrijgelaten zijn meerdere bezoekers en beveiligers van het Nova-festival, enkele militairen en bewoners van kibboetsen die door Hamas werden overvallen. Het zijn voornamelijk twintigers en dertigers, de oudste is 48 jaar. Onder hen zijn twee broers en een tweeling, een Servisch-Duitse Israëliër en verschillende gijzelaars die de afgelopen tijd door Hamas werden gefilmd voor propagandavideo's, zoals een gijzelaar die zei zijn eigen graf te hebben gegraven. Tegen de tijd dat Trump onder groot applaus de Knesset betrad, kwamen de eerste bussen met vrijgelaten Palestijnen aan in Ramallah op de bezette Westoever. Met Palestijnse sjaals kwamen mannen, vrouwen en minderjarigen uit de bussen, verwelkomd door een grote mensenmassa. Ze werden daar, soms na vele jaren gevangenschap, in de armen gesloten door familieleden. Ook bij het Nasser-ziekenhuis in Gaza kwamen colonnes van bussen aan met vrijgelaten Palestijnen. Een kleinere groep arriveerde rond 14.00 uur in Egypte. Het ging om 154 Palestijnen die waren veroordeeld tot lange of zelfs levenslange gevangenisstraffen. Het was vooraf bekend dat een klein deel van de gevangenen niet naar de Palestijnse Gebieden zou worden uitgezet maar naar het buitenland. De massaal bezochte aankomst van vrijgelaten Palestijnen in Khan Younis in Gaza: Rond 16.30 uur landde Trump in Egypte voor een top met wereldleiders over de toekomst van Gaza. In de badplaats Sharm el-Sheikh had hij eerst een ontmoeting met de Egyptische president Sisi. Hij bedankte Sisi voor zijn bijdrage aan het akkoord tussen Israël en Hamas en zei dat \"de tweede fase van de onderhandelingen\" over het bestand is begonnen. \"Iedereen zei dat vrede in het Midden-Oosten onmogelijk was\", zei Trump op de persconferentie. \"Maar het gebeurt nu voor onze ogen.\" Ondertekening Vervolgens verwelkomde hij de leiders van meer dan twintig landen en ging met ze op de foto. Onder anderen de Franse president Macron, de Britse premier Starmer, de Duitse kanselier Merz en de Nederlandse premier Schoof waren aanwezig, net als de secretaris-generaal van de Verenigde Naties Guterres. Op de top werd een document over het bestand in Gaza ondertekend. Voor het oog van talloze camera's zetten Trump en Sisi samen met de Turkse president Erdogan en de Qatarese emir Tamim bin Hamad al Thani hun handtekening. Dat was vooral symbolisch; voor zover bekend zijn er nu geen aanvullende afspraken gemaakt. Na de top vloog Trump terug naar huis. Aan het eind van de middag werden ook de eerste twee lichamen van dode gijzelaars door Hamas overgedragen aan het Rode Kruis. Aan het begin van de avond kwamen daar nog twee lichamen bij. De stoffelijke overschotten werden vervolgens overgedragen aan het Israëlische leger. Hamas moet volgens de afspraken 28 lichamen van in Israël ontvoerde mensen vrijgeven. De militanten hadden vooraf al gezegd dat dit lastig zou worden, mede door de verwoestingen in de Gazastrook. Dat er vandaag maar vier stoffelijke overschotten zijn overgedragen, leidt tot afschuw bij de belangenorganisatie van de gijzelaarsfamilies. De families eisen dat het bestand met Hamas wordt opgeschort totdat de terreurbeweging alle lichamen heeft overgedragen. Duurzame vrede? Hoe het de komende dagen verdergaat is onduidelijk. De wapenstilstand met de bijbehorende eisen is pas de eerste stap in het twintigpuntenplan van Trump voor Gaza. Er moeten ingewikkelde gesprekken worden gevoerd om tot een duurzame vrede te komen. Zo wil Israël dat Hamas zich volledig ontwapent, en Hamas wil op zijn beurt dat Israëlische troepen zich volledig terugtrekken uit Gaza. Er moeten harde noten worden gekraakt over wie Gaza gaat besturen. In het Amerikaanse plan staan bovendien geen garanties over de oprichting van een Palestijnse staat. Hulporganisaties maken zich in ieder geval op om de komende periode veel meer noodhulp te bieden in de Gazastrook. De verwoesting in Gaza is groot en veel inwoners hebben geen huis meer om naar terug te keren. Sinds gisteren komen er zo'n 600 vrachtwagens per dag binnen met voedsel en andere hulpgoederen. Een deel komt vanuit Egypte.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586388","published_date":"2025-10-13T20:57:28","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:48:17.214493","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":970,"author":null,"raw_content_length":6727,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":4.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Gaza"],"persons":["Trump","Tel Aviv","Netanyahu"],"locations":["Gijzelaarsplein","Israël","Knesset","Israëliërs"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":6273,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Alle levende gijzelaars terug","top","toekomst","dit","Een nieuw tijdperk","vrede","het begin","de Amerikaanse president","de dag","levende gijzelaars"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Alle levende gijzelaars terug":2.0,"top":2.0,"toekomst":2.0,"dit":2.0,"Een nieuw tijdperk":1.0,"vrede":1.0,"het begin":1.0,"de Amerikaanse president":1.0,"de dag":1.0,"levende gijzelaars":1.0}},"age_hours":4.946954549166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7413,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0686,"sadness":0.0259,"fear":0.0633,"anger":0.0523,"disgust":0.0382},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a ceasefire agreement and potential peace plan.

De verdachte zou zich herhaaldelijk hebben voorgedaan als agent om mensen geld en sieraden af te troggelen. De man werd opgepakt door een agent die zich voordeed als argeloos slachtoffer. De politieagent werd in de avond van 18 februari thuis opgebeld. Een man, die zich voorstelde als agent Jorik van Kampen, beweerde dat er in de buurt een inbraak was gepleegd. De oplichter zei dat een wijkagent genaamd Dennis Grootfaan langs zou komen om het geld en de sieraden van de opgebelde persoon \"veilig te stellen\". De echte agent had door dat het ging om oplichting. Hij besloot het spel mee te spelen, zo schrijft het Openbaar Ministerie. Tien minuten later stond de 23-jarige verdachte voor de deur. De nepagent werd bij binnenkomst van de woning opgepakt. Beller blijft onbekend Later bleek dat meerdere oudere personen aangifte hadden gedaan van oplichting door de nepagenten 'Van Kampen' en 'Grootfaan'. Via camerabeelden, ooggetuigenverklaringen en DNA is de 23-jarige geïdentificeerd als de oplichter die langs de deuren ging. De politie gaat ervan uit dat er twee daders waren, maar het is nooit opgehelderd wie de beller was. Bij slachtoffers waren geld en waardevolle spullen gestolen. Ook beweerde de nepagent dat hun digitale bankrekening moest worden \"gecontroleerd\". In werkelijkheid werd de pinlimiet verhoogd. Vervolgens ging de verdachte er met de pincode, pinpas en creditcard van de slachtoffers vandoor. 'Ook na arrestatie babbeltrucks uitgehaald' Na zijn arrestatie in februari is de voorlopige hechtenis van de verdachte in mei geschorst. Er is niet vermeld waarom dat is gedaan. Volgens het OM is de 23-jarige na zijn vrijlating doorgegaan met babbeltrucks als nepagent. Vervolgens is de verdachte opnieuw aangehouden. \"De impact voor slachtoffers bij deze feiten is groot, doordat verdachten aan en in huis komen\", zegt de officier van justitie. \"Er is op doortrapte wijze misbruik gemaakt van hun vertrouwen, terwijl deze mensen juist vanwege hun leeftijd in toenemende mate afhankelijk zijn van hulp van allerlei personen.\" Wat het OM betreft moet de man twintig maanden de cel in, waarvan drie maanden voorwaardelijk.

Dat bevestigt het Openbaar Ministerie aan de NOS na berichtgeving door De Telegraaf. Die krant meldde dat politie en OM geen aanwijzingen zien voor extra dreiging tegen de PVV-voorman. Geert Wilders heeft vrijdag zijn verkiezingscampagne tot nader order stilgelegd, naar aanleiding van een mogelijke dreiging vanuit België. Een Belgische terreurcel, die een aanslag wilde plegen op de Belgische premier De Wever, zou ook Wilders als mogelijk doelwit hebben genoemd. Wilders zei op X dat de Nationaal Coördinator Terrorismebestrijding en Veiligheid (NCTV) dat aan hem bevestigd heeft. Twee jongeren uit Antwerpen zitten vast op verdenking van poging tot terroristische moord op de Belgische premier. De NCTV verwachtte geen 'restdreiging', meldde Wilders. Niet in debat De PVV-leider meldde zich af voor het verkiezingsdebat van de NOS op Radio 1 en het televisiedebat van RTL.
