The proof relies on recovering the Hessian of a solution to the equation, which is interpreted as a Riemannian metric $g$. Interestingly, although the equation is posed on a Euclidean domain, the inverse problem becomes anisotropic since the metric $g$ appears as a coefficient matrix in the linearized equation. As an intermediate step, we prove that the DN map of the non-divergence form equation \\[ g^{ab} \\partial_{ab} v = 0 \\] uniquely determines the conformal class of the metric $g$ on a simply connected planar domain, without the usual diffeomorphism invariance. To address the challenges of full nonlinearity, we develop asymptotic expansions for complex geometric optics solutions in the planar setting and solve a resulting nonlocal $\\overline{\\partial}$-equation by proving a unique continuation principle for it. These techniques are expected to be applicable to a wide range of inverse problems for nonlinear equations.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11572","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.332749","language":"en","tags":["mathdg","preprints","mathap","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Tony Liimatainen, Yi-Hsuan Lin","raw_content_length":1349,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dirichlet"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["0 \\"]},"char_count":1326,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["An inverse problem","the Monge","new Abstract","the study","inverse boundary value problems","the setting","fully nonlinear PDEs","an inverse source problem","the Monge-Ampere equation ","det D2 u"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["the study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"An inverse problem":2.0,"the Monge":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the study":1.0,"inverse boundary value problems":1.0,"the setting":1.0,"fully nonlinear PDEs":1.0,"an inverse source problem":1.0,"the Monge-Ampere equation ":1.0,"det D2 u":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787035161388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7914,"joy":0.0689,"surprise":0.1012,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on inverse problems for a mathematical equation.

Recent developments in high-dimensional statistics typically require covariates to strictly follow a Gaussian distribution to precisely characterize the properties of estimators. To relax this Gaussianity requirement, the existing literature has examined conditions under which estimators achieve universality. In particular, independence among the elements of the high-dimensional covariates has played a critical role. In this study, we focus on high-dimensional linear models with covariates exhibiting block dependence, where covariate elements can only be dependent within each block, and show that estimators for such models retain universality. Specifically, we prove that the distribution of estimators with Gaussian covariates can be approximated by the distribution of estimators with non-Gaussian covariates having the same moments under block dependence. To establish this result, we develop a generalized Lindeberg principle suitable for handling block dependencies and derive new error bounds for correlated covariate elements. We further demonstrate the universality result across several different estimators.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19244","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.413843","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Toshiki Tsuda, Masaaki Imaizumi","raw_content_length":1386,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear","Gaussianity"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1385,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["estimators","Universality","a Gaussian distribution","Announce Type","Abstract","the universality property","high-dimensional linear models","which","the distribution","the covariates"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"estimators":5.0,"Universality":2.0,"a Gaussian distribution":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the universality property":1.0,"high-dimensional linear models":1.0,"which":1.0,"the distribution":1.0,"the covariates":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7897498980555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8374,"joy":0.0374,"surprise":0.0734,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0117,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.0095},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on theoretical research regarding the universality of estimators in high-dimensional linear models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_278c0b3b9173","title":"Enforcing Mesh Quality Constraints in Shape Optimization with a Gradient Projection Method","content":"arXiv:2412.00006v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: For the numerical solution of shape optimization problems, particularly those constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs), the quality of the underlying mesh is of utmost importance. Particularly when investigating complex geometries, the mesh quality tends to deteriorate over the course of a shape optimization so that either the optimization comes to a halt or an expensive remeshing operation must be performed before the optimization can be continued. In this paper, we present a novel, semi-discrete approach for enforcing a minimum mesh quality in shape optimization. Our approach is based on Rosen's gradient projection method, which incorporates mesh quality constraints into the shape optimization problem. The proposed constraints bound the angles of triangular and solid angles of tetrahedral mesh cells and, thus, also bound the quality of these mesh cells. The method treats these constraints by projecting the search direction to the linear subspace of the currently active constraints. Additionally, only slight modifications to the usual line search procedure are required to ensure the feasibility of the method. We present our method for two- and three-dimensional simplicial meshes. We investigate the proposed approach numerically for the drag minimization of an obstacle in a two-dimensional Stokes flow, the optimization of the flow in a pipe governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, and for the large-scale, three-dimensional optimization of a structured packing used in a distillation column. Our results show that the proposed method is indeed capable of guaranteeing a minimum mesh quality for both academic examples and challenging industrial applications. Particularly, our approach allows the shape optimization of complex structures while ensuring that the mesh quality does not deteriorate.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00006","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.416575","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":271,"author":"Sebastian Blauth, Christian Leith\\\"auser","raw_content_length":1884,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.355,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Rosen","Enforcing Mesh Quality Constraints"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1883,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mesh Quality Constraints","Shape Optimization","a Gradient Projection Method","the optimization","arXiv241200006v4","Abstract","the numerical solution","shape optimization problems","particularly those","partial differential equations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Mesh Quality Constraints"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mesh Quality Constraints":2.0,"Shape Optimization":2.0,"a Gradient Projection Method":2.0,"the optimization":2.0,"arXiv241200006v4":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the numerical solution":1.0,"shape optimization problems":1.0,"particularly those":1.0,"partial differential equations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7898469663888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.348,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8696,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.843,"joy":0.0173,"surprise":0.0185,"sadness":0.0202,"fear":0.0145,"anger":0.0296,"disgust":0.0569},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for enforcing mesh quality in shape optimization, which is crucial for simulating and optimizing designs in various engineering applications.

Furthermore, we prove that, in the absence of a feedthrough term, every local minimizer is also a global minimizer. For cases involving a non-trivial feedthrough term, we analyze global minimizers in relation to the extremal solutions of the Lur'e equations, which can serve as tools for identifying local minima. To solve the resulting numerical optimization problem efficiently, we propose an initialization strategy based on modifying the feedthrough term and a restart strategy when it is likely that the optimization has converged to a non-global local minimum.

Furthermore, we show the transcendence of special values of nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms at CM points and relate them to the periods of CM Drinfeld $A$-modules.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01357","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.424767","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathnt","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"O\\u{g}uz Gezm\\.i\\c{s}, Sriram Chinthalagiri Venkata","raw_content_length":1102,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Drinfeld","the de Rham"],"persons":["Drinfeld","Chen","\\infty$","GL_2(K)$"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\infty$.","$M_I^2$"]},"char_count":1101,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms","admissible coefficient rings","arXiv250301357v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the finite field","mathbbF_q","q elements","its function field","a fixed closed point","the ring"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"nearly holomorphic Drinfeld modular forms":3.0,"admissible coefficient rings":2.0,"arXiv250301357v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the finite field":1.0,"mathbbF_q":1.0,"q elements":1.0,"its function field":1.0,"a fixed closed point":1.0,"the ring":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7901404536111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8685,"joy":0.0262,"surprise":0.0658,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

Our results are classified in 1D massless and massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D massless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as time tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate proportional to $ t \\log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the smallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the existence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime. In the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new virial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that there are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small odd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity. This result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but without requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an important class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future use of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac solitary waves. Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \\geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for global solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone'' region. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions propagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully constructed weighted virial identities.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05410","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.425627","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Sebastian Herr, Christopher Maul\\'en, Claudio Mu\\~noz","raw_content_length":1639,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dirac"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1636,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Decay","solutions","nonlinear Dirac equations","arXiv250305410v4 Announce Type","Abstract","the long-time behavior","small and large solutions","a broad class","nonlinear Dirac-type equations","Our results"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Decay":2.0,"solutions":2.0,"nonlinear Dirac equations":2.0,"arXiv250305410v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the long-time behavior":1.0,"small and large solutions":1.0,"a broad class":1.0,"nonlinear Dirac-type equations":1.0,"Our results":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7901709352777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8859,"joy":0.0153,"surprise":0.0262,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0194,"anger":0.0302,"disgust":0.0175},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on the decay of solutions to nonlinear Dirac equations.

Although wSAA is widely used for contextual decisions, its uncertainty quantification remains limited. In addition, computational budgets tie sample size to optimization accuracy, creating a coupling that standard analyses often ignore. We establish central limit theorems for wSAA and construct asymptotic-normality-based confidence intervals for optimal conditional expected costs. We analyze the statistical--computational tradeoff under a computational budget, characterizing how to allocate resources between sample size and optimization iterations to balance statistical and optimization errors. These allocation rules depend on structural parameters of the objective; misspecifying them can break the asymptotic optimality of the wSAA estimator. We show that ``over-optimizing'' (running more iterations than the nominal rule) mitigates this misspecification and preserves asymptotic normality, at the expense of a slight slowdown in the convergence rate of the budget-constrained estimator. The common intuition that ``more data is better'' can fail under computational constraints: increasing the sample size may worsen statistical inference by forcing fewer algorithm iterations and larger optimization error. Our framework provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty for contextual decision-making under computational constraints. It offers practical guidance on allocating limited resources between data acquisition and optimization effort, clarifying when to prioritize additional optimization iterations over more data to ensure valid confidence intervals for conditional performance.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12747","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.426854","language":"en","tags":["statml","preprints","statme","mathoc","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Yanyuan Wang, Xiaowei Zhang","raw_content_length":1857,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.165,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1856,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Over-optimizing","Normality","wSAA","arXiv250312747v3 Announce Type","Abstract","uncertainty quantification","contextual stochastic optimization","weighted sample average approximation","which","machine-learned relevance weights"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["uncertainty quantification"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Over-optimizing":2.0,"Normality":2.0,"wSAA":2.0,"arXiv250312747v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"uncertainty quantification":1.0,"contextual stochastic optimization":1.0,"weighted sample average approximation":1.0,"which":1.0,"machine-learned relevance weights":1.0}},"age_hours":2.790214273888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9012,"joy":0.0175,"surprise":0.0296,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0125,"anger":0.0204,"disgust":0.012},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the statistical efficiency of algorithms used in contextual stochastic optimization, which could indirectly improve the efficiency of resource allocation in various sustainability-related applications.

This class covers, among others, optimization problems with complementarity, vanishing, or switching constraints, which are notoriously challenging due to their highly combinatorial structure. The focus of our study is twofold. First, we investigate approximate stationarity conditions and the associated strict constraint qualifications which can be used to infer stationarity of local minimizers. While such concepts are already known in the context of so-called Mordukhovich-stationarity, we introduce suitable extensions associated with strong stationarity. Second, a qualification condition is established which, based on an approximately Mordukhovich- or strongly stationary point, can be used to infer its Mordukhovich- or strong stationarity, respectively. In contrast to the aforementioned strict constraint qualifications, this condition depends on the involved sequences justifying approximate stationarity and, thus, is not a constraint qualification in the narrower sense. However, it is much easier to verify as it merely requires to check the (positive) linear independence of a certain family of gradients. In order to illustrate the obtained findings, they are applied to optimization problems with complementarity constraints, where they can be naturally extended to the well-known concepts of weak and Clarke-stationarity.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22551","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.428004","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Isabella K\\\"aming, Patrick Mehlitz","raw_content_length":1540,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1539,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["qualification conditions","Approximate stationarity","disjunctive optimization","concepts","application","MPCCs","optimization problems","arXiv250322551v2 Announce Type","Abstract","this paper"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"qualification conditions":3.0,"Approximate stationarity":2.0,"disjunctive optimization":2.0,"concepts":2.0,"application":2.0,"MPCCs":2.0,"optimization problems":2.0,"arXiv250322551v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0}},"age_hours":2.790258308888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.835,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.0302,"sadness":0.0106,"fear":0.0595,"anger":0.0338,"disgust":0.019},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical optimization methods applicable to problems with disjunctive constraints, which can arise in various engineering and scientific contexts.

As a consequence, we can give a complete characterization of those $h$-local domains of Krull dimension $1$ for which every direct summand of a direct sum of copies of a single finitely generated torsion-free module is again a direct sum of finitely generated modules.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16568","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.431802","language":"en","tags":["mathrt","mathra","preprints","mathac","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Rom\\'an \\'Alvarez, Dolors Herbera, Pavel P\\v{r}\\'ihoda","raw_content_length":1069,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Krull"],"persons":["Bass","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$1$"]},"char_count":1066,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Relatively big projective modules","their applications","sum decompositions","Announce Type","Abstract","projective modules","respect","a trace ideal","P Pvrihoda","an extension"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Relatively big projective modules":2.0,"their applications":2.0,"sum decompositions":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"projective modules":1.0,"respect":1.0,"a trace ideal":1.0,"P Pvrihoda":1.0,"an extension":1.0}},"age_hours":2.790398673888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.4785,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8957,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.796,"joy":0.056,"surprise":0.1318,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0023,"anger":0.007,"disgust":0.0021},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research that could potentially lead to more efficient resource allocation in the future, but it has no direct or measurable impact on sustainability currently.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_2004439fbb0a","title":"Density of irreducible operators in the trace","content":"arXiv:2504.17190v5 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In 1968, Paul Halmos initiated the research on density of the set of irreducible operators on a separable Hilbert space. Through the research, a long-standing unsolved problem inquires: is the set of irreducible operators dense in $B(H)$ with respect to the trace-class norm topology? Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\\varepsilon >0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\\Vert K \\Vert_1 < \\varepsilon$? For $p>1$, to prove the $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm. In the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras. Moreover, we discover that there is a strong connection between the problem and another related operator-theoretical problem related to type $\\mathrm{II}_1$ von Neumann algebras.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17190","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.432194","language":"en","tags":["mathfa","mathoa","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Junsheng Fang, Chunlan Jiang, Minghui Ma, Junhao Shen, Rui Shi, Tianze Wang","raw_content_length":1202,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["\\varepsilon$","\\Vert","Hilbert","B(H)$","Paul Halmos"],"locations":["Weyl-von Neumann"],"monetary":["$p>1$","$\\Vert K","$T $","$p=1$"]},"char_count":1197,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["irreducible operators","Density","the trace","the research","the set","Announce Type","Abstract","Paul Halmos","density","a separable Hilbert space"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["the research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"irreducible operators":4.0,"Density":2.0,"the trace":2.0,"the research":2.0,"the set":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Paul Halmos":1.0,"density":1.0,"a separable Hilbert space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.790415970277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.837,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0984,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.013,"anger":0.0241,"disgust":0.0152},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research with no direct or immediate connection to sustainability.

It is also proved that $\\xi(F)$ vanishes iff there exists some bundle-like metric on $M$ for which the leaves are minimal submanifolds. As a consequence, this tautness property is verified in any of the following cases: (a) when the Ricci curvature of the transverse Riemannian structure is positive, or (b) when $F$ is of codimension one.

The zero divisor and octonion cardinality at all levels is derived. Split algebras are proved to be isomorphic for any power-associative algebra and share the same non-associative structure with different zero divisors.

Motivated by neuroscience, medical science, and social science examples, we describe the node dynamics as a continuous-time inhomogeneous Markov process. Under mean-field and homogeneity assumptions, appropriate for large scale-free and disassortative signal networks, we derive differential equations characterising the global activation behaviour and compute the expected hitting time to network triggering.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_4fb888a31e4b","title":"Optimal-PhiBE: A PDE-based Model","content":"arXiv:2506.05208v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This paper addresses continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) where the system dynamics are governed by an unknown stochastic differential equation, and only discrete-time observations are available. Existing approaches face limitations: model-based PDE methods suffer from non-identifiability, while model-free methods based on the discrete-time optimal Bellman equation (Optimal-BE) suffer from large discretization errors that are highly sensitive to both the system dynamics and the reward structure. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Optimal-PhiBE, a formulation that integrates discrete-time information into a continuous-time PDE, combining the strength of both existing frameworks while mitigating their limitations. Optimal-PhiBE exhibits smaller discretization errors when the uncontrolled system evolves slowly, and demonstrates reduced sensitivity to oscillatory reward structures, and enables model-free algorithms that bypass explicit dynamics estimation. In the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) setting, sharp error bounds are established for both Optimal-PhiBE and Optimal-BE. The results show that Optimal-PhiBE exactly recovers the optimal policy in the undiscounted case and substantially outperforms Optimal-BE when the problem is weakly discounted or control-dominant.

ECI uncovers hidden information from equilibrium measurements, offering a new perspective on inverse MFGs. To improve computational efficiency, two acceleration variants are introduced: Best Response Iteration (BRI), which uses inexact forward solvers, and Hierarchical ECI (HECI), which incorporates multilevel grids. While BRI performs efficiently in general settings, HECI proves particularly effective in recovering low-frequency potentials. We also highlight a connection between the potential identification problem in inverse MFGs and inverse linear parabolic equations, suggesting promising directions for future theoretical analysis.

This result is {\\it optimal}, in view of explicit examples and solves a long standing open problem. - Next we turn to the half-space problem for $p>2$ and we completely classify entire solutions: any entire sol. is stationary and one-dimensional. The assumption is sharp in view of explicit examples for $p=2$. - Then we show that the situation is also completely different for ancient sol. in a half-space: there exist nonstationary ancient sol. for all $p>1$. Nevertheless, we show that any ancient sol. is necessarily positive, and that stationarity and one-dimensionality are recovered provided a -- close to optimal -- polynomial growth restriction is imposed on the sol. - In addition we establish new and optimal, local estimates of Bernstein and Li-Yau type. The proofs of the Liouville and classif. results are delicate, based on integral estimates, a translation-compactness procedure and comparison arguments, combined with our Bernstein and Li-Yau type estimates.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12214","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.445607","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":287,"author":"Loth Damagui Chabi, Philippe Souplet","raw_content_length":1853,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.435,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KPZ","Dirichlet","BCN"],"persons":["Hamilton","\\R^n$","Liouville","Dirichlet B.C. - First"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$p>2$"]},"char_count":1840,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Classification","entire and ancient solutions","the diffusive Hamilton","arXiv250712214v2","Announce Type","Abstract","the diffusive HJ eq","Dirichlet conditions","which","stochastic control"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Classification":2.0,"entire and ancient solutions":2.0,"the diffusive Hamilton":2.0,"arXiv250712214v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the diffusive HJ eq":1.0,"Dirichlet conditions":1.0,"which":1.0,"stochastic control":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7908831852777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.259500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8519,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9349,"joy":0.0135,"surprise":0.0149,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0137},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical research on the diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

The SW dynamics was introduced as an attractive alternative to the local Glauber dynamics, often offering faster convergence rates to stationarity in a variety of settings. A series of works have characterized the asymptotic behavior of the speed of convergence of the mean-field SW dynamics for all $q \\ge 2$ and all values of the inverse temperature parameter $\\beta > 0$. In particular, it is known that when $\\beta > q$ the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $\\Theta(\\log n)$. We strengthen this result by showing that for all $\\beta > q$, there exists a constant $c(\\beta,q) > 0$ such that the mixing time of the SW dynamics is $c(\\beta,q) \\log n + \\Theta(1)$. This implies that the mean-field SW dynamics exhibits the cutoff phenomenon in this temperature regime, demonstrating that this Markov chain undergoes a sharp transition from ''far from stationarity'' to ''well-mixed'' within a narrow $\\Theta(1)$ time window.

This approach establishes a unified methodology for analyzing large deviation principles (LDPs), entropy minimization, entropy production, and inverse learning problems in stochastic systems. The second-order HJ equations are shown to play a central role in bridging stochastic dynamics and measure theory while forming the foundation of stochastic geometric mechanics and their applications in stochastic thermodynamics. The large deviation rate function is rigorously derived from the probabilistic structure of path measures and demonstrated to be equivalent to the Onsager--Machlup functional of stochastic gradient systems coupled with second-order HJ equations. We revisit entropy minimization problems, including finite time horizon problems and Schr\\\"{o}dinger's problem, demonstrating the connections with stochastic geometric mechanics. In the context of stochastic thermodynamics, we present a novel decomposition of entropy production, revealing that thermodynamic irreversibility can be interpreted as the difference of the corresponding forward and backward second-order HJ equations. Furthermore, we tackle the challenging problem of identifying stochastic gradient systems from observed most probable paths by reformulating the original nonlinear and non-convex problem into a linear and convex framework through a second-order HJ equation. Together, this work establishes a comprehensive mathematical study of the relations between path measures and stochastic dynamical systems, and their diverse applications in stochastic thermodynamics and beyond.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02469","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.448982","language":"en","tags":["preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Jianyu Hu, Qiao Huang, Yuanfei Huang","raw_content_length":1863,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Hamilton"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1860,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["path measures","A study","second-order Hamilton-","arXiv250802469v3 Announce Type","Abstract","This paper","a systematic investigation","the mathematical structure","their profound connections","stochastic differential equations"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"path measures":3.0,"A study":2.0,"second-order Hamilton-":2.0,"arXiv250802469v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a systematic investigation":1.0,"the mathematical structure":1.0,"their profound connections":1.0,"stochastic differential equations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7910040866666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.626,"joy":0.0998,"surprise":0.1864,"sadness":0.0137,"fear":0.0361,"anger":0.0236,"disgust":0.0144},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for analyzing stochastic systems, including applications in stochastic thermodynamics.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_ecc71d4b95ff","title":"An effective analytic recurrence for prime numbers","content":"arXiv:2508.02690v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The Golomb--Keller formula expresses the next prime $p_{n+1}$ as a recurrence relation in terms of the first $n$ primes $p_1, \\ldots, p_n$ using the Riemann zeta function and an Euler product, but requires taking a limit as $s \\to \\infty$, rendering it non-constructive. We transform this asymptotic formula into an effective recurrence by proving that a finite parameter $s \\leq p_n$ suffices when combined with the ceiling function, establishing a constructive method valid for all $n \\geq 1$. The minimal integer parameter $s_n$ (OEIS A389650) reveals deep connections to prime constellations. We prove $\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} \\sigma_n = 0$ unconditionally, where $\\sigma_n = s_n/p_n$.

The constant $C$ relates to the densest admissible prime constellation, connecting to the Hardy--Littlewood conjectures.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_66b166255c9a","title":"Coagulation","content":"arXiv:2508.18668v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Jim Pitman's~(1999) celebrated coagulation-fragmentation duality for the PD($\\alpha$,$\\theta$) family of laws of Pitman and Marc Yor~(1997) has resisted generalization beyond its canonical setting. We resolve this by introducing a novel, four-part coupled process built upon the Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Process (PHIBP), a framework developed for modeling microbiome species sampling. This approach yields a tractable generalization of the duality in two fundamental directions: to processes driven by arbitrary subordinators and to the previously uncharacterised multi-group ($J \\ge 1$) setting, providing explicit laws for both. The static, fixed-time partitions are revealed to be a single projection of an inherently dynamic system. This new construction simultaneously defines: (i) the fine-grained partition, (ii) its coagulation operator, (iii) a forward-in-time system of coupled, time-homogeneous fragmentation processes in the sense of Jean Bertoin~(2006), and (iv) a dual, backward-in-time structured coalescent that drives simultaneous, across-group merger events. All four components are governed by a unified compositional structure, yielding their exact compound Poisson representations. The hallmark of this work is its circumvention of direct, and often intractable, analysis on mass and integer partition spaces. By shifting the problem to this transparent framework, the generalized duality emerges as a natural consequence of the architecture itself.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18668","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.452836","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathpr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Lancelot F.

We focus on spatially periodic deviations from the background metric, which is why we study the semi-linear wave equation on the three-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^3$ within the Sobolev spaces $H^m(\\mathbb{T}^3)$. This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the Nordstr\\\"om equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid governed by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full coupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid with a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstr\\\"om equation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity precludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work \\cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy estimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces.

The motivating examples of the classes of flaprojective modules and relatively cotorsion modules for a ring homomorphism are discussed, and periodicity conjectures formulated for them.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07645","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.455105","language":"en","tags":["mathct","mathag","mathra","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Leonid Positselski","raw_content_length":1642,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["C)$","\\mathsf","Becker"],"persons":["Quillen","Grothendieck","Announce Type","\\mathsf"],"locations":["B)$"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1641,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Coderived and contraderived categories","a cotorsion pair","mathsf","arXiv250907645v2 Announce Type","Abstract","mathsf Amathsf","a set","objects","a Grothendieck category","a natural equivalence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a cotorsion pair"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Coderived and contraderived categories":2.0,"a cotorsion pair":2.0,"mathsf":2.0,"arXiv250907645v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"mathsf Amathsf":1.0,"a set":1.0,"objects":1.0,"a Grothendieck category":1.0,"a natural equivalence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.791219603611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9121,"joy":0.0128,"surprise":0.0439,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.012,"disgust":0.0088},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematical research.

The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H>1,0<1) ). We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing 'a' and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H).

This result resolves a long-standing question in variational analysis and extends the well-known equivalence theorem for polyhedral sets to a significantly broader class of non-polyhedral cases. Our proof strategy departs from traditional variational techniques, integrating insights from convex geometry with powerful tools from algebraic topology. A cornerstone of our analysis is a new fundamental lemma concerning the local structure of the normal cone map for arbitrary closed convex sets, which reveals how the dimension of normal cones varies in the neighborhood of a boundary point. This geometric insight is the key to applying degree theory, allowing us to prove that a crucial function associated with the problem has a topological index of $\\pm1$. This, via a homological version of the inverse mapping theorem, implies that the function is a local homeomorphism, which in turn yields the strong regularity of the original solution map. This result unifies and extends several existing stability results for problems such as conventional nonlinear programming, nonlinear second-order cone programming, and nonlinear semidefinite programming under a single general framework.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14194","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.457857","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Jiaming Ma, Defeng Sun","raw_content_length":1384,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Aubin Property"],"persons":["Aubin"],"locations":[],"monetary":["over $C^2$"]},"char_count":1383,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Aubin Property","Generalized Equations","over C2","arXiv250914194v4 Announce Type","Abstract","This paper","the equivalence","the Aubin property","the strong regularity","generalized equations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Aubin Property":2.0,"Generalized Equations":2.0,"over C2":2.0,"arXiv250914194v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the equivalence":1.0,"the Aubin property":1.0,"the strong regularity":1.0,"generalized equations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7913230424999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7158,"joy":0.1249,"surprise":0.1203,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0075,"anger":0.0193,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical mathematical research that could potentially improve optimization algorithms used in various fields, including those related to sustainability.

This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing many real-world applications. This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of {\\'e}tale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \\textit{{\\'e}tale mismatch torsor}, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \\times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic object amenable to both qualitative classification and quantitative analysis of the global relationship between the two morphisms. Our main results are twofold. First, we provide a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first {\\'e}tale cohomology group $H_{\\text{\\'e}t}^1(X \\times_S Y, \\underline{\\pi_1^{\\text{\\'e}t}(S)})$. Second, we construct a canonical filtration on this classifying cohomology group based on the theory of infinitesimal neighborhoods. This filtration induces a new invariant, which we term the \\textit{order of mismatch}, providing a hierarchical, algebraic measure for the degree of approximation between the morphisms. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields, demonstrating how both the characteristic class and its order reveal subtle arithmetic properties.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15616","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.459422","language":"en","tags":["mathat","mathag","preprints","research","mathematics","mathnt","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Dongfang Zhao","raw_content_length":1669,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["\\psi","morphisms"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$X \\times_S"]},"char_count":1668,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Approximate Fiber Products","Schemes","Homotopical Invariants","Announce Type","The classical fiber product","algebraic geometry","a powerful tool","loci","two morphisms","a base scheme"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algebraic geometry"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Approximate Fiber Products":2.0,"Schemes":2.0,"Homotopical Invariants":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"The classical fiber product":1.0,"algebraic geometry":1.0,"a powerful tool":1.0,"loci":1.0,"two morphisms":1.0,"a base scheme":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7913850969444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8099,"joy":0.0678,"surprise":0.0848,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0168,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical research.

Therefore, we now focus on the constant factor in front of $m^{\\alpha_f(H)}$. In this paper, we give some results of $\\rho(H,m)$ when $H$ is a cycle or path. We conjecture that for any cycle $C_k$ with $k \\ge 5$, $\\rho(C_k,m)= (1+o(1))\\left( m/k\\right)^{k/2}$ and the bound achieves by the blow up of $C_k$. For even cycles, we establish an upper bound with an extra constant factor. For odd cycles, we can only establish an upper bound with an extra factor depending on $k$. We prove that $\\rho(P_{2l},m) \\le \\frac{m^l}{2(l-1)^{l-1}}$ and $\\rho(P_{2l+1},m) \\le \\frac{m^{l+1}}{4l^l}$, where $l \\ge 2$. We also conjecture the asymptotic value of $\\rho(P_k, m)$. The entropy method is mainly used to prove our results.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17502","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.460156","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Yichen Wang, Xiamiao Zhao, Mei Lu","raw_content_length":1239,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["\\rho(H","\\max \\{c(G","c(G","m^{\\alpha_f(H)}$."],"locations":[],"monetary":["$C_k$ with $k \\ge","\\rho(C_k","5$, $"]},"char_count":1238,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a graph","induced copies","Edge version","the inducibility","the entropy method","the maximum number","rhoH","Announce Type","Abstract","The inducibility"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a graph":3.0,"induced copies":3.0,"Edge version":2.0,"the inducibility":2.0,"the entropy method":2.0,"the maximum number":2.0,"rhoH":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The inducibility":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7914125391666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8953,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.0611,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0041,"anger":0.0148,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical research on graph inducibility.

Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By using the Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\\to\\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.460899","language":"en","tags":["mathat","preprints","mathcv","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Daniil Kucher","raw_content_length":1151,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Riemann"],"persons":["\\frac{f}{g}$","Hopf"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$S^2$","S^2 \\to S^2$"]},"char_count":1150,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Topological Degree","Maps","common zeros","Announce Type","Abstract","an effective method","the topological degree","continuous functions","S2 to","the Riemann sphere"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Topological Degree":2.0,"Maps":2.0,"common zeros":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"an effective method":1.0,"the topological degree":1.0,"continuous functions":1.0,"S2 to":1.0,"the Riemann sphere":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7914426908333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8733,"joy":0.0272,"surprise":0.0266,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0272,"anger":0.0297,"disgust":0.01},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper describes a method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions.

We give a technique to find roots of the GFP. As a corollary of this result, we give an alternative proof of a special case of Favard's Theorem. The general case of Favard's Theorem guarantees that there is a measure to determine whether a sequence of second-order polynomials is orthogonal or not. However, the theorem does not provide an explicit such measure. Our special case gives both the explicit measure and the relationship between the second-order recurrence and orthogonality, demonstrating whether the GFP polynomials are orthogonal or not. This allows us to classify which of familiar GFPs are orthogonal and which are not. Some familiar orthogonal polynomials include the Fermat, Fermat-Lucas, both types of Chebyshev polynomials, both types of Morgan-Voyce polynomials, and Vieta and Vieta-Lucas polynomials. However, we prove that the Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, and Pell-Lucas sequences are not orthogonal. In Section \\ref{sectionrw}, we give a brief description of discrete--time and continuous--time Morkov chains with special emphasis on birth-and-death stochastic processes. We find sufficient conditions on the polynomial's coefficients under which a given family of orthogonal polynomial induces a Markov chain. These families of orthogonal polynomials include Chebyshev polynomials of first kind and Fermat-Lucas. In the final section, we highlight some connections between orthogonal polynomials and Markov processes. These relations are not new but seem to have been somewhat forgotten. We do so to draw the attention of researchers in the orthogonal polynomial and probability communities for further collaboration.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00074","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.465119","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Cristian F.

First, we prove that the limit $$\\lambda^{(p)}(Q,\\mathcal{P}):=\\lim\\limits_{n\\to \\infty}n^{s/p-s}\\max\\{\\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H): H\\in \\mathcal{P}~~\\mbox{and}~~|V(H)|=n\\}$$ exists, and for $p>1$, it satisfies $$\\pi(Q,\\mathcal{P})=\\lambda^{(p)}(Q,\\mathcal{P}).$$ Second, we study spectral generalized Tur\\'an problems. Specifically, we establish a spectral stability result and apply it to derive a spectral version of the Erd\\H{o}s Pentagon Problem: for $p\\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the balanced blow-up of $C_{5}$ maximizes $\\lambda^{(p)}(C_{5},H)$ among all $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs $H$, thereby improving a result of Liu \\cite{Liu2025}. Furthermore, we show that for $p\\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the $l$-partite Tur\\'an graph $T_{l}(n)$ attains the maximum $\\lambda^{(p)}(K_{s},H)$ among all $n$-vertex F-free graphs $H$, where $F$ is an edge-critical graph with $\\chi(F)=l+1$. This provides a spectral analogue of a theorem due to Ma and Qiu \\cite{MQ2020}.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02776","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.466836","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Jian Zheng, Honghai Li, Li Su","raw_content_length":1856,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["%Keevash","\\inft","H[\\{i_{1},\\ldots","i_{s}\\}\\in \\binom{[n]}{s}}\\mathcal{N}(Q"],"persons":["Mubayi","Lenz","\\mathcal{N}(Q"],"locations":["x_{i_{s}}.$$ %"],"monetary":["$r$-uniform hypergraphs","$n$-vertex $","$(p","$p\\geq1$","$s$-vertex $"]},"char_count":1847,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Spectral extremal problems","the p","arXiv251002776v2","Announce Type","Abstract","an s-vertex r-uniform hypergraph","an n-vertex r-uniform hypergraph","mathcalNQ","the number","isomorphic copies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Spectral extremal problems":2.0,"the p":2.0,"arXiv251002776v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"an s-vertex r-uniform hypergraph":1.0,"an n-vertex r-uniform hypergraph":1.0,"mathcalNQ":1.0,"the number":1.0,"isomorphic copies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7916462530555552,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9213,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0277,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.0088,"anger":0.0118,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a theoretical mathematics paper.

These structures are new tetrads specially devised for Yang-Mills theories, Abelian and Non-Abelian in four-dimensional Lorentzian curved spacetimes. In the present manuscript a new tetrad is introduced for the Yang- Mills SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) formulation. These new tetrads establish a link between local groups of gauge transformations and local groups of spacetime transformations that we previously called LB1 and LB2. New theorems are proved regarding isomorphisms between local internal SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) groups and local tensor products of spacetime LB1 and LB2 groups of transformations. These new tetrads define at every point in spacetime two orthogonal planes that we called blades or planes one and two. These are the local planes of covariant diagonalization of the stress-energy tensor. These tetrads are gauge dependent. Tetrad local gauge transformations leave the tetrads inside the local original planes without leaving them. These local tetrad gauge transformations enable the possibility to connect local gauge groups Abelian or non-Abelian with local groups of tetrad transformations. These new tetrads have displayed manifestly and non-trivially the coupling between Yang-Mills fields and gravity. The new tetrads and the stress-energy tensor allow for the introduction of three new local gauge invariant objects. Using these new gauge invariant objects and in addition a new general local duality transformation, a new algorithm for the gauge invariant diagonalization of the Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor is developed as an application. This is a paper about grand Standard Model gauge theories - General Relativity gravity unification and grand group unification in four-dimensional curved Lorentzian spacetimes.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0912","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.474039","language":"en","tags":["preprints","hep-th","gr-qc","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":273,"author":"Alcides Garat","raw_content_length":1913,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.365,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Yang-Mills"],"persons":["LB1"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1912,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SU3","Abelian","arXiv12070912v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","The relationship","gauge and gravity amounts","underlying new geometrical local structures","These structures","new tetrads","Yang-Mills theories"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SU3":2.0,"Abelian":2.0,"arXiv12070912v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The relationship":1.0,"gauge and gravity amounts":1.0,"underlying new geometrical local structures":1.0,"These structures":1.0,"new tetrads":1.0,"Yang-Mills theories":1.0}},"age_hours":2.791902569722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7902,"joy":0.0335,"surprise":0.1496,"sadness":0.008,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0035},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on unifying gauge theories and gravity.

Semiparametric robust Q-learning eliminates the residual confounding that can occur when parametric working models for confounding influences are misspecified. However, in the presence of many potential tailoring variables, constructing an optimal adaptive treatment strategy using either approach may lead to including extraneous variables that contribute little or no benefit while increasing implementation costs, thereby placing an undue burden on patients. Using data-driven selection processes to identify a smaller set of informative prognostic factors is straightforward; however, proper statistical inference must account for this selection process. In this paper, we adapt the Universal Post-Selection Inference (UPoSI) procedure to the semiparametric Robust Q-learning method. UPoSI, introduced for use with linear models, allows for very general variable selection mechanisms. Our approach addresses the unique challenges stemming from the use of UPoSI with semiparametric multistage decision methods. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed confidence regions. We illustrate our proposed methods through an application to adaptive treatment strategy estimation for substance abuse.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03233","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.475206","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statme","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Jeremiah Jones, Ashkan Ertefaie, James R.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_48f63d18124a","title":"Explaining and Connecting Kriging with Gaussian Process Regression","content":"arXiv:2408.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Kriging and Gaussian Process Regression are statistical methods that allow predicting the outcome of a random process or a random field by using a sample of correlated observations. In other words, the random process or random field is partially observed, and by using a sample a prediction is made, pointwise or as a whole, where the latter can be thought as a reconstruction. In addition, the techniques permit to give a measure of uncertainty of the prediction. The methods have different origins. Kriging comes from geostatistics, a field which started to develop around 1950 oriented to mining valuation problems, whereas Gaussian Process Regression has gained popularity in the area of machine learning in the last decade of the previous century. In the literature, the methods are usually presented as being the same technique. However, beyond this affirmation, the techniques have yet not been compared on a thorough mathematical basis and neither explained why and under which conditions this affirmation holds. Furthermore, Kriging has many variants and this affirmation should be precised. In this paper, this gap is filled. It is shown, step by step how both methods are deduced from the first principles -- with a major focus on Kriging, the mathematical connection between them, and which Kriging variant corresponds to which Gaussian Process Regression set up. The three most widely used versions of Kriging are considered: Simple Kriging, Ordinary Kriging and Universal Kriging. It is found, that despite their closeness, the techniques are different in their approach and assumptions, in a similar way the Least Square method, the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator method and the Likelihood method in regression do. I hope this work deepen the understanding of the relation between Kriging and Gaussian Process Regression, and serves as a cohesive introductory resource for researchers.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02331","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.478830","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statme","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":301,"author":"Marius Marinescu","raw_content_length":1959,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.505,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1958,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Connecting Kriging","Gaussian Process Regression","a sample","replace-cross Abstract","Kriging","Gaussian Process","statistical methods","the outcome","a random process","a random field"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Connecting Kriging":2.0,"Gaussian Process Regression":2.0,"a sample":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Kriging":1.0,"Gaussian Process":1.0,"statistical methods":1.0,"the outcome":1.0,"a random process":1.0,"a random field":1.0}},"age_hours":2.792080061666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8952,"joy":0.0375,"surprise":0.0394,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.0116,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on the mathematical connection between Kriging and Gaussian Process Regression, two statistical methods.
