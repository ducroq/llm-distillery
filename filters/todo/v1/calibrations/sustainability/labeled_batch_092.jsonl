{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_b9ab2772a449","title":"Don't Just Chase \"Highlighted Tokens\" in MLLMs: Revisiting Visual Holistic Context Retention","content":"arXiv:2510.02912v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02912","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:34.478566","language":"en","tags":["cscv","computer-science","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Xin Zou, Di Lu, Yizhou Wang, Yibo Yan, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Xu Zheng, Linfeng Zhang, Xuming Hu","raw_content_length":1527,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multimodal Large Language Models","Chase"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1526,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MLLMs","Dont Just Chase","Highlighted Tokens","Visual Holistic Context Retention","attention","arXiv251002912v2","Announce Type","Abstract","their powerful capabilities","Multimodal Large Language Models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MLLMs","Multimodal Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MLLMs":3.0,"Dont Just Chase":2.0,"Highlighted Tokens":2.0,"Visual Holistic Context Retention":2.0,"attention":2.0,"arXiv251002912v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"their powerful capabilities":1.0,"Multimodal Large Language Models":1.0}},"age_hours":8.984733858055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.6314999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8737,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9409,"joy":0.0024,"surprise":0.0142,"sadness":0.0138,"fear":0.0059,"anger":0.0098,"disgust":0.013},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a more efficient method for visual token pruning in MLLMs, potentially reducing computational overhead.

Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels, will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03016","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:34.478953","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Dong-Dong Wu, Jiacheng Cui, Wei Wang, Zhiqiang Shen, Masashi Sugiyama","raw_content_length":1244,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Imprecise Supervision","DMIS","Diffusion Models"],"persons":[],"locations":["noisy"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1243,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Learning Robust Diffusion Models","Imprecise Supervision","Announce Type","Abstract","Conditional diffusion models","remarkable success","various generative tasks","their training","large-scale datasets","imprecise information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["their training"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Learning Robust Diffusion Models":2.0,"Imprecise Supervision":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Conditional diffusion models":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"various generative tasks":1.0,"their training":1.0,"large-scale datasets":1.0,"imprecise information":1.0}},"age_hours":8.984747715,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.016,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0032,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4799,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.01,"sadness":0.0234,"fear":0.2865,"anger":0.1019,"disgust":0.0941},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework (DMIS) for training diffusion models with imprecise supervision.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_1f7297d1a7b9","title":"Fine dust risk perception, perceived restorativeness, and environmental policy support among park visitors","content":"ObjectivesFine dust (PM2.5) pollution has emerged as a severe environmental and public health issue in South Korea, affecting respiratory health and reducing outdoor physical activity levels. Given these concerns, individuals increasingly seek restorative natural environments to mitigate the psychological and physical effects of poor air quality. This study examines how fine dust risk perception influences individuals' experiences in perceived restorative environments (PRE) and their intention to support environmental policies. Specifically, this study enhances the understanding of how restorative experiences in urban parks and concerns about environmental issues influence recreationists' perspectives on environmental policies.MethodsThis study was conducted at Jeju Gotjawal Provincial Park, a well-preserved forest ecosystem known for its ecological importance. A total of 408 visitors were surveyed using purposive sampling. Participants completed a structured questionnaire assessing their fine dust risk perception, perceived restorative experience in nature, and intention to support environmental policies. Data was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the proposed hypotheses. In addition, a bootstrap analysis was conducted to examine the mediating effects.ResultsThe findings indicate that individuals who perceive fine dust pollution as a serious issue are more likely to experience a heightened sense of psychological and physical restoration in natural settings. Furthermore, those who find natural environments more restorative tend to express stronger support for environmental policies, suggesting that their positive experiences in nature reinforce their commitment to sustainability. The study also found that perceived restorativeness plays a key role in connecting fine dust risk perception to environmental policy support, emphasizing the importance of personal experiences in shaping pro-environmental attitudes.ConclusionsThese results highlight the role of nature-based experiences in fostering both psychological well-being and environmental engagement. As air pollution continues to pose health risks, providing access to clean, green spaces can be an effective intervention for improving public health and encouraging sustainability advocacy.

However, detection of walking in free-living environments remains challenging, especially in clinical populations. Machine learning models may offer more robust gait identification, but most are trained on healthy participants, limiting their generalizability to other populations. To extend a previously validated machine learning model, an updated model was trained using an open dataset (PAMAP2), before progressively including training datasets with additional healthy participants and a clinical osteoarthritis population. The performance of the model in identifying walking was also evaluated using a frequency-based gait detection algorithm. The results showed that the model trained with all three datasets performed best in terms of activity classification, ultimately achieving a high accuracy of 96% on held-out test data. The model generally performed on par with the heuristic, frequency-based method for walking bout identification. However, for patients with slower gait speeds (<0.8 m/s), the machine learning model maintained high recall (>0.89), while the heuristic method performed poorly, with recall as low as 0.38.

These artifacts overlap in frequency with genuine cardiac signals, rendering traditional filtering methods ineffective and increasing the risk of false alarms and misdiagnosis, particularly in wearable and ambulatory ECG applications. To address this, we propose the Feature–Shuffle Multi–Head Attention Autoencoder (FMHA–AE), a novel architecture integrating multi-head self–attention (MHSA) and a feature–shuffle mechanism to enhance ECG denoising. MHSA captures long–range temporal and spatial dependencies, while feature shuffling improves representation robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that FMHA–AE achieves an average signal–to–noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 25.34 dB and a percentage root mean square difference (PRD) of 10.29%, outperforming conventional wavelet–based and deep learning baselines. These results confirm the model’s ability to retain critical ECG morphology while effectively removing noise. FMHA–AE demonstrates strong potential for real–time ECG monitoring in mobile and clinical environments. This work contributes an efficient deep learning approach for noise–robust ECG analysis, supporting accurate cardiovascular assessment under motion–prone conditions.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6322","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:52.780214","language":"en","tags":["sensors","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Szu-Hong Wang","raw_content_length":1631,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FMHA","ECG","MHSA"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1461,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Feature","Shuffle","MultiHead Attention","Based Autoencoder","Electrode Motion Noise","ECG Applications","Electrocardiograms","ECGs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Feature":2.0,"Shuffle":2.0,"MultiHead Attention":2.0,"Based Autoencoder":2.0,"Electrode Motion Noise":2.0,"ECG Applications":2.0,"Electrocardiograms":1.0,"ECGs":1.0}},"age_hours":12.990465542222221,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.1725,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1655,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6234,"joy":0.0024,"surprise":0.0237,"sadness":0.0406,"fear":0.1216,"anger":0.0572,"disgust":0.1312},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel deep learning approach for ECG denoising, demonstrating improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and percentage root mean square difference (PRD) compared to existing methods.

Visual over-reliance may occur in iSCI individuals to maintain postural control. This can challenge their postural stability in various contexts of daily life activities. The present study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of balance training with intermittent visual deprivation using stroboscopic glasses on postural control and visual reliance during quiet standing in iSCI individuals. Training impact on walking performance was also evaluated. Seven chronic iSCI individuals participated in a 6-week home-based balance training program, three times weekly, using stroboscopic glasses. Postural and walking abilities were assessed pre- and post-training using a bipedal stance test (BST) and 10 m walking test (10 MWT). BST was performed, with open-eyes (OE) and closed-eyes (CE), on a force plate for three 30 s trials. The center of pressure (CoP) variables included were CoP area (A-CoP) and CoP mean velocity (MV-CoP). Romberg ratios (CE/OE) for two CoP variables were calculated. Duration and speed were measured in 10 MWT. Intervention feasibility was assessed using the feasibility and acceptability questionnaire. Data from able-bodied individuals were recorded and used as references of physiological performance. iSCI individuals were significantly less stable and showed visual over-reliance for postural steadiness compared to controls. Also, their walking ability was impaired. All iSCI individuals completed the training (adherence rate: 84%) and rated it highly feasible. A-CoP and MV-CoP significantly reduced after training in CE condition (p = 0.018, respectively) but not in OE condition (p > 0.05). The Romberg ratio of A-CoP was significantly lower (p = 0.018), but the Romberg ratio of MV-CoP was not (p > 0.05). A significant reduction in duration and increase in speed (p = 0.018, respectively) in performing the 10 MWT were observed. Preliminary findings from this explorative study indicated that 6-week home-based balance training with intermittent visual deprivation was feasible, acceptable, and had promising potential benefits in improving postural control with a reduction in visual over-reliance in iSCI individuals.

This study validated the heart rate measurement accuracy of one chest-worn device (Zephyr BioHarness 3.0), a research-grade wrist-worn device (EmbracePlus), and five commercial wrist-worn wearable devices (Fitbit Charge 5, Fitbit Sense 2, Garmin Vivosmart 4, WHOOP 4.0, and Withings Scanwatch) against a 12-lead ECG using a 20 min protocol simulating real-life dynamics, including rest and varied-intensity walking. Device performance was evaluated across the full protocol and during transient states, defined as periods of rapid heart rate change. Accuracy and agreement were evaluated across per-second, 10 s, and 60 s resolutions. The Zephyr device showed a strong performance during all dynamic conditions. Among the wrist-worn devices, the Fitbit Charge 5 and Sense 2 showed the highest accuracy overall, while the Garmin Vivosmart 4 demonstrated greater stability during transitions. The WHOOP 4.0, Withings Scanwatch, and EmbracePlus devices performed acceptably during steady-state conditions, but were less accurate during transitions. Performance notably declined across all wrist-worn devices during transient states, with motion onset and large step changes in heart rate exacerbating measurement errors. Larger averaging windows improved accuracy by smoothing variability. The findings underscore that wrist-worn wearable devices may be better suited for average and trend heart rate monitoring rather than capturing acute dynamics. However, the Garmin and Fitbit devices showed suitable when requiring moderate accuracy during dynamic conditions. These results highlight the importance of context-specific validation and informed device selection to ensure effective use in health and stress-related applications.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6319","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:52.780905","language":"en","tags":["sensors","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Jean-Marie Aerts","raw_content_length":1876,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.275,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EmbracePlus","Zephyr BioHarness 3.0","ECG","Garmin Vivosmart 4"],"persons":["Vol","Withings Scanwatch"],"locations":["Zephyr"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1876,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Accuracy","Heart Rate Measurement","Transient States","A Validation Study","Wearables","Wearable devices","health","stress"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A Validation Study"],"healthcare_tech":["health"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Accuracy":2.0,"Heart Rate Measurement":2.0,"Transient States":2.0,"A Validation Study":2.0,"Wearables":2.0,"Wearable devices":1.0,"health":1.0,"stress":1.0}},"age_hours":12.990498955833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.18,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.836,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7099,"joy":0.0132,"surprise":0.0447,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.1955,"anger":0.0156,"disgust":0.0142},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study validates the accuracy of wearable heart rate monitors under dynamic conditions, providing valuable data for health and stress monitoring applications.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_bcd04df877e8","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6316: Implementation of an SS","content":"This paper presents a passive wireless temperature sensor based on an SS-compensated LC-thermistor topology. The system consists of two magnetically coupled LC tanks—each composed of a coil and a series capacitor—forming a series–series (SS) compensation network. The secondary side includes a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor connected in series with its coil and capacitor, acting as a temperature-dependent load. Magnetically coupled resonant systems exhibit different coupling regimes: weak, critical, and strong. When operating in the strongly coupled regime, the original resonance splits into two distinct frequencies—a phenomenon known as bifurcation. At these split resonance frequencies, the load impedance on the secondary side is reflected as pure resistance at the primary side. In the SS topology, this reflected resistance is equal to the thermistor resistance, enabling precise wireless sensing. The advantage of the SS-compensated configuration lies in its ability to map changes in the thermistor’s resistance directly to the input impedance seen by the reader circuit. As a result, the sensor can wirelessly monitor temperature variations by simply tracking the input impedance at split resonance points. We experimentally validate this property on a benchtop prototype using a one-port VNA measurement, demonstrating that the input resistance at both split frequencies closely matches the expected thermistor resistance, with the observed agreement influenced by the parasitic effects of RF components within the tested temperature range. We also demonstrate that using the average readout provides first-order immunity to small capacitor drift, yielding stable readings.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6316","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:52.781276","language":"en","tags":["sensors","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Yeliz Dikerler Kozar","raw_content_length":1758,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NTC"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1708,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Implementation","an SS","series","This paper","a passive wireless temperature sensor","an SS-compensated LC-thermistor topology","The system","two magnetically coupled LC tanks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Implementation":2.0,"an SS":2.0,"series":2.0,"This paper":1.0,"a passive wireless temperature sensor":1.0,"an SS-compensated LC-thermistor topology":1.0,"The system":1.0,"two magnetically coupled LC tanks":1.0}},"age_hours":12.990515034166666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9309,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0259,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0109,"disgust":0.0145},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a temperature sensor prototype.

Traditional reliability assessment methods, often based on static power balance, struggle to comprehensively reflect frequency dynamic characteristics and their impact on power supply reliability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sequential Monte Carlo reliability assessment method integrated with a system frequency response model. First, an SFR model for the isolated microgrid, incorporating diesel generators, gas turbines, energy storage, and wind turbines, is established. For synchronous units, a frequency deviation-based failure rate correction mechanism is introduced to characterize the impact of frequency fluctuations on equipment reliability. State transitions are achieved by integrating failure and repair rates to reach threshold values. Second, sequential Monte Carlo simulation is employed to conduct time-series simulations of annual operation. Random sampling of unit failure and repair times is used to calculate reliability metrics. MATLAB/Simulink simulation results demonstrate that system frequency fluctuations caused by power imbalance worsen unit failure rates, leading to microgrid reliability values lower than static calculations. This provides reference for planning, design, and operational scheduling of isolated microgrids.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4009","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.574639","language":"en","tags":["open-access","electronics","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Xiaoyu Che","raw_content_length":1448,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Data Driven Analytics for Distribution Network Power Supply Reliability Assessment Method Considering Frequency Regulating Scenario","SFR"],"persons":["Vol","Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1448,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pages","Data Driven Analytics","Frequency Regulating Scenario","Islanded microgrids","significant frequency stability challenges","limited system capacity","low inertia levels","the strong variability","renewable energy sources","Traditional reliability assessment methods"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["renewable energy sources"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pages":2.0,"Data Driven Analytics":2.0,"Frequency Regulating Scenario":2.0,"Islanded microgrids":1.0,"significant frequency stability challenges":1.0,"limited system capacity":1.0,"low inertia levels":1.0,"the strong variability":1.0,"renewable energy sources":1.0,"Traditional reliability assessment methods":1.0}},"age_hours":12.990914821666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7292,"joy":0.0052,"surprise":0.0205,"sadness":0.0377,"fear":0.1667,"anger":0.0258,"disgust":0.0149},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a method to improve the reliability of isolated microgrids with renewable energy sources by considering frequency fluctuations.

This study aims to examine how enterprise software solutions influence tourism indicators across European countries. Using a triangulated methodological approach, we employed factor analysis to identify underlying dimensions, neural network modeling to detect nonlinear relationships, and hierarchical clustering to group countries based on digital and tourism profiles. The results consistently highlight CRM (Customer Relationship Management) as the most influential technological factor linked to both the net occupancy rate of beds and the number of nights spent at tourist accommodations. While AI (artificial intelligence) technologies currently have less impact, their importance is growing, as seen in emerging patterns.

To tackle this, we propose a novel meta-learning framework, GMM-SCM-DCM, which features a Dynamic Component Management (DCM) mechanism. This framework employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for probabilistic meta-feature representation. The core innovation, the DCM mechanism, enables online structural evolution of the meta-learner by dynamically splitting, merging, or pruning Gaussian components based on a bimodal similarity metric, ensuring sustained alignment with shifting data distributions. A Single-Component Mechanism (SCM) is utilized for precise base learner initialisation. To ensure a rigorous and realistic validation, we reconstructed the Telecom Italia Milan dataset by applying unsupervised clustering and meta-feature engineering to identify and label four distinct functional zones: residential, commercial, mixed use, and crucially, non-stationary areas. This curated dataset provides a critical testbed for non-stationary forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional methods and meta-learning baselines, achieving a 9.3% reduction in MAE and approximately 70% faster convergence. The model’s superiority is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies, robustness tests across base learners and data scales, and successful cross-dataset validation on the Shanghai Telecom dataset, showcasing its exceptional generalization capability and practical utility for real-world network management.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4003","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.576124","language":"en","tags":["open-access","electronics","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Jingyu Zhang","raw_content_length":1675,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GMM-SCM-DCM","Dynamic Component Management","DCM"],"persons":["Vol","SCM"],"locations":["Milan"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1665,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A Traffic Forecasting Framework","Cellular Networks","a Dynamic Component Management Mechanism","Accurate forecasting","cellular traffic","non-stationary environments","a formidable challenge","real-world traffic patterns"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Traffic Forecasting Framework":2.0,"Cellular Networks":2.0,"a Dynamic Component Management Mechanism":2.0,"Accurate forecasting":1.0,"cellular traffic":1.0,"non-stationary environments":1.0,"a formidable challenge":1.0,"real-world traffic patterns":1.0}},"age_hours":12.990985414166666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.259500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8519,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9341,"joy":0.0075,"surprise":0.0201,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.018,"anger":0.0114,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel traffic forecasting framework for cellular networks, aiming to improve network efficiency.

Short-duration transformer overloads, often overlooked in conventional hourly or optimization-based planning models, can accelerate asset aging before voltage limits are reached. This study introduces a second-by-second, multi-agent-based simulation (MABS) framework that couples empirically calibrated Distributed Energy Resource (DER) adoption trajectories with real-time-price (RTP)–driven household charging decisions. Using a real 160-household feeder in Denmark (2024–2025), five progressively integrated DER scenarios are evaluated, ranging from EV-only adoption to fully synchronized EV–PV–battery coupling. Results reveal that uncoordinated EV charging under RTP shifts demand to early-morning hours, causing the first transformer overload within four months. PV deployment alone offers limited relief, while adding batteries delays overload onset by 55 days. Only fully coordinated EV–PV–battery adoption postponed the first overload by three months and reduced total overload hours in 2025 by 39%. The core novelty of this work lies in combining empirically grounded adoption behavior, second-level temporal fidelity, and agent-based grid dynamics to expose transient overload mechanisms invisible to coarser models. The framework provides a diagnostic and planning tool for distribution system operators to evaluate tariff designs, bundled incentives, and coordinated DER deployment strategies that enhance transformer longevity and grid resilience in future energy communities.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4001","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.576511","language":"en","tags":["open-access","electronics","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Zheng Grace Ma","raw_content_length":1781,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Empirically Informed Multi","DER","Distributed Energy Resource"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["Denmark"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1721,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Empirically Informed Multi","The rapid proliferation","residential electric vehicles","EVs","rooftop photovoltaics","PVs","the-meter","energy communities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["rooftop photovoltaics"],"renewable_energy":["rooftop photovoltaics"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Empirically Informed Multi":2.0,"The rapid proliferation":1.0,"residential electric vehicles":1.0,"EVs":1.0,"rooftop photovoltaics":1.0,"PVs":1.0,"the-meter":1.0,"energy communities":1.0}},"age_hours":12.991001774166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8521,"joy":0.0138,"surprise":0.0916,"sadness":0.0034,"fear":0.013,"anger":0.0175,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study uses a simulation framework to analyze the impact of DER adoption on grid infrastructure.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_e4d11e59ae6c","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9061: Multi","content":"The Yellow River Delta is one of China’s most ecologically fragile regions, experiencing prolonged pressures from rapid urbanization and ecological degradation. Existing research, however, has predominantly focused on constructing ecological security patterns under single scenarios, with limited systematic multi-scenario comparisons and insufficient statistical support. To address this gap, this study proposes an integrated framework of “land use simulation—multi-scenario ecological security pattern construction—statistical comparative analysis.” Using the PLUS model, three scenarios were constructed—Business-as-Usual (BAU), Priority Urban Development (PUD), and Priority Ecological Protection (PEP)—to simulate land use changes by 2040. Habitat quality assessment, Multi-Scale Pattern Analysis (MSPA), landscape connectivity, and circuit theory were integrated to identify ecological source areas, corridors, and nodes, incorporating a novel hexagonal grid partitioning method. Statistical significance was evaluated using parametric tests (ANOVA, t-test) and non-parametric tests (permutation test, PERMANOVA). Analysis indicated significant differences in ecological security patterns across scenarios. Under the PEP scenario, ecological source areas reached 3580.42 km2 (12.39% of the total Yellow River Delta), corresponding to a 14.85% increase relative to the BAU scenario and a 32.79% increase relative to the PUD scenario. These gains are primarily attributable to stringent wetland and forestland protection policies, which successfully limited the encroachment of construction land into ecological space. Habitat quality and connectivity markedly improved, resulting in the highest ecosystem stability. By contrast, the PUD scenario experienced an 851.46 km2 expansion of construction land, resulting in the shrinkage of ecological source areas and intensified fragmentation, consequently increasing ecological security risks. The BAU scenario demonstrated moderate outcomes, with a moderately balanced spatial configuration. In conclusion, this study introduces an ecological restoration strategy of “five zones, one belt, one center, and multiple corridors” based on multi-scenario ecological security patterns. This provides a scientific foundation for ecological restoration and territorial spatial planning in the Yellow River Delta, while the proposed multi-scenario statistical comparison method provides a replicable methodological framework for ecological security pattern research in other delta regions.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9061","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.797861","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":317,"author":"Dong Lv","raw_content_length":2623,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.585,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multi-Scale Pattern Analysis","Priority Ecological Protection","Priority Urban Development","MSPA","PUD"],"persons":[],"locations":["Yellow River Delta","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2533,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Multi","The Yellow River Delta","Chinas most ecologically fragile regions","prolonged pressures","rapid urbanization and ecological degradation","Existing research","ecological security patterns","single scenarios"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"research_academic":["Existing research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"The Yellow River Delta":1.0,"Chinas most ecologically fragile regions":1.0,"prolonged pressures":1.0,"rapid urbanization and ecological degradation":1.0,"Existing research":1.0,"ecological security patterns":1.0,"single scenarios":1.0}},"age_hours":12.99137381861111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7525,"joy":0.0084,"surprise":0.035,"sadness":0.0332,"fear":0.1089,"anger":0.0267,"disgust":0.0352},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study models and compares different ecological security patterns under various scenarios in the Yellow River Delta.

Within this scope, a survey was administered to university students (n = 280). Participant scores for the survey sections containing five-point Likert-type questions on climate change awareness were calculated using min–max normalization. The normalized data was then processed using the k-means algorithm, a well-known technique in unsupervised machine learning. This resulted in a classification (clustering) related to climate change awareness. The number of clusters was determined using the Silhouette index. Three clusters identified using k-means and Silhouette index (S≈0.55) revealed the knowledge and application levels of student groups regarding climate change awareness. As a result of clustering, it was determined that Cluster-3 students (n = 134, 47.9%), defined as having a high level of knowledge and application, had a higher impact value in their overall assessments of green space-focused issues related to climate change awareness compared to the overall assessments of students in other clusters. Some notable findings concerning the attitudes of Cluster-3 students highlight climate change awareness-related practices.

A precise understanding of the impact of climate change on winter wheat growth and the scientific use of meteorological resources are crucial for ensuring food security, optimizing agricultural planting structures and agricultural sustainability. This study uses statistical methods and focuses on the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, utilizing data from 25 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2010 and winter wheat yield data from 1978 to 2010. Twelve refined indicators encompassing temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration were constructed. Path analysis was employed to determine their weights, establishing a comprehensive climate indicator model. Results indicate: Temperature indicators in the region show an upward trend, with accumulated temperature of the whole growth period increasing at a rate of 61.1 °C·d/10a. Precipitation indicators reveal precipitation of the whole growth period rising at 3.9 mm/10a and pre-winter precipitation increasing at 4.2 mm/10a. Sunshine duration exhibits a declining trend, decreasing at 72.7 h/10a during the whole growth period.

It applies the Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) method to investigate the synergistic effects of technological environment, cultural context, and individual cognitive factors in promoting learners’ knowledge innovation capabilities. The results show the following: (1) No single condition constitutes a prerequisite for learners to achieve high-level knowledge innovation when acting in isolation. However, enhancing technical capabilities has a relatively universal impact on promoting learners to achieve these results. (2) The multiple concurrency of the technological environment, cultural environment, and individual cognitive conditions has generated multiple configuration patterns that promote knowledge innovation, indicating that the paths leading to learners’ high-level innovation exhibit the characteristic of numerous concurrency.

The results show that FDI and foreign trade significantly promote manufacturing output growth, while technological innovation and human capital have a more sensitive response to growth fluctuations in the short term. The Granger causality test shows that FDI, technological innovation, and human capital all have strong predictive power and can effectively predict the future trend of manufacturing output. The impulse response function and variance decomposition analysis further reveal the key role of these factors in promoting the manufacturing industry’s long-term sustainable development. Based on the above findings, this paper suggests that local government should continue to optimize the structure and quality of attracting foreign capital, increase the support for technology research and development and intelligent manufacturing, enhance the added value of export products, and strengthen human capital investment so as to promote China’s manufacturing industry’s high-quality and sustainable development and provide reference for other developing countries’ manufacturing development.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9059","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.799401","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Radziah Adam","raw_content_length":1332,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FDI","Promoting Sustainable Manufacturing Growth Through Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Trade: Evidence"],"persons":["Granger"],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1282,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FDI","technological innovation","human capital","Sustainability","Pages","Sustainable Manufacturing Growth","Foreign Direct Investment","Foreign Trade","Evidence","Chinas 28 Sub"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["technological innovation","Foreign Direct Investment"],"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FDI":3.0,"technological innovation":3.0,"human capital":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Sustainable Manufacturing Growth":2.0,"Foreign Direct Investment":2.0,"Foreign Trade":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"Chinas 28 Sub":2.0}},"age_hours":12.99143546388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.721,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9442,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8496,"joy":0.075,"surprise":0.034,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0165,"disgust":0.0146},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper analyzes the impact of FDI, foreign trade, technological innovation, and human capital on manufacturing output growth in China.

Lake Victoria, the largest tropical lake and a critical freshwater resource for East Africa, faces increasing eutrophication driven by nutrient inflows from agriculture, urbanization, and industrial activities. This study assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of water quality along Uganda’s Lake Victoria coast by integrating field measurements (2014–2024) with Landsat 8/9 imagery. Chlorophyll-a, a proxy for algal blooms, and Secchi disk depth, an indicator of water clarity, were selected as key parameters. Cloud-free satellite images were processed using the Dark Object Subtraction method, and spectral reflectance values were correlated with field data. Linear regression models from single bands and band ratios showed strong performance, with adjusted R2 values of up to 0.88. When tested on unseen data, the models achieved R2 values above 0.70, confirming robust predictive ability. Results revealed high algal concentrations for nearshore and clearer offshore waters.

These challenges threaten not only short-term reliability but also the sustainable operation of renewable-dominated energy systems. Existing frequency control methods are often unable to robustly handle heterogeneous delays, thereby limiting the resilience of power systems with high shares of renewables. To address this issue, we propose a parametric Riccati equation-based frequency control method that adaptively adjusts control parameters to balance system robustness and optimality under asynchronous delays. Controller stability is guaranteed by Barbalat’s lemma. The main contributions include: (i) developing a microgrid frequency control model that incorporates asynchronous delays, (ii) designing a delay-aware controller using the parametric Riccati equation, and (iii) validating its effectiveness on a modified New England 39-bus system. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method enhances frequency stability under disaster-induced islanding scenarios.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_20ac0e49ae1a","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9049: Sustainable Mining of Open","content":"The rational delineation of open-pit mining areas constitutes the core foundation for achieving safe, efficient, economical, and sustainable mining operations. The quality of this decision-making directly impacts the economic benefits experienced throughout the mine’s entire lifecycle and the efficiency of resource recovery. Traditional open-pit mining area delineation relies on an experience-driven manual process that is inefficient and incapable of real-time dynamic data optimization. Thus, there is an urgent need to establish an intelligent decision-making model integrating multi-source data and multi-objective optimization. To this end, this study proposes an intelligent mining area division algorithm. First, a geological complexity quantification model is constructed, incorporating innovative adaptive discretisation resolution technology to achieve precise quantification of coal seam distribution. Second, based on the quantified stripping-to-mining ratio within grids, a block-growing algorithm generates block grids, ensuring uniformity of the stripping-to-mining ratio within each block. Subsequently, a matrix of primary directional variations in the stripping-to-mining ratio is constructed to determine the principal orientation for merging blocks into mining areas. Finally, intelligent open-pit mining area delineation is achieved by comprehensively considering factors such as the principal direction of mining areas, geological conditions, boundary shapes, and economic scale. Practical validation was conducted using the Shitoumei No. 1 Open-Pit Coal Mine in Xinjiang as a case study in engineering. Engineering practice demonstrates that adopting this methodology transforms mining area delineation from an experience-driven to a data-driven approach, significantly enhancing delineation efficiency. Manual simulation of a single scheme previously required approximately 15 days. Applying the methodology proposed herein reduces this to just 0.5 days per scheme, representing a 96% increase in efficiency. Design costs were reduced by approximately CNY 190,000 per iteration. Crucially, the intelligently recommended scheme matched the original design, validating the algorithm’s reliability. This research provides crucial support for theoretical and technological innovation in intelligent open-pit coal mining design, offering technical underpinnings for the sustainable development of open-pit coal mines.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9049","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.801068","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":312,"author":"Zhigao Liu","raw_content_length":2459,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.56,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2439,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Sustainable Mining","Open","The rational delineation","open-pit mining areas","the core foundation","The quality","the economic benefits","the mines entire lifecycle"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Sustainable Mining":2.0,"Open":2.0,"The rational delineation":1.0,"open-pit mining areas":1.0,"the core foundation":1.0,"The quality":1.0,"the economic benefits":1.0,"the mines entire lifecycle":1.0}},"age_hours":12.99151190861111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.3445,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8689,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.848,"joy":0.0408,"surprise":0.011,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0441,"disgust":0.0419},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed algorithm that improves the efficiency of open-pit coal mining area delineation.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_45b7c55c238e","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9052: The Effect of Students’ Material Status and Zoom Fatigue on Their Perception of Emergency Remote Teaching Satisfaction and Remote Teaching Sustainability from the Perspective of Education Faculty Students in Serbia","content":"The introduction of emergency remote teaching in university education during the COVID-19 pandemic was not a matter of choice, but an attempt to make education sustainable in times of crisis. However, some research, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, showed that digital inequality caused by the unequal material status of students could have an impact on remote teaching. Also, before the COVID-19 pandemic, some researchers pointed out a new phenomenon, Zoom fatigue, as an accompanying phenomenon of video conferences with potential harm to the physical and mental health of consumers. The aim of this study is to examine the possibility that material status and Zoom fatigue may play the role of a moderator in the attitude of students towards ERT. The sample included 148 students attending education faculties in Serbia. The data obtained were frequencies, percentages, descriptive statistics, χ2 test results, t test for independent samples, ANOVA, and linear regression.The results showed that 13% of students find the lack of financial funds for the purchase of an Internet connection with high-speed data flow to be an aggravating circumstance. Moreover, it transpires that Zoom fatigue may play the role of a moderator in students’ attitude towards ERT, particularly concerning the possibility of introducing remote teaching as a permanent form of teaching;in addition, certain aspects of students’ material status, primarily monthly household income, were a significant predictor of Zoom fatigue level on the ZEF scale.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9052","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.801428","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Uroš V.
