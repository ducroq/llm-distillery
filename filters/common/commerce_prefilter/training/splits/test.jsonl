{"id": "ai_engadget_365c981f4637", "title": "CloverPit, a Balatro", "content": "CloverPit is one of my favorite games of the year so far. Developer Panik Arcade took the formula that helped make Balatro so successful ‚Äî using various tools to bend the rules of the game to help you rack up obscenely high scores ‚Äî and based it around a slot machine rather than poker. It‚Äôs been a hit so far on PC, where it has sold more than a million copies since September, and on Xbox. CloverPit has been among the top 20 most-played titles on Game Pass since its surprise debut there last month. Now, the horror-tinged roguelite is venturing into new territory, as it‚Äôs coming to iOS and Android on December 17.The mobile versions of the game are said to have a fully-optimized interface, as well as all of the post-launch updates, such as the Hard Mode that Panik Arcade recently added. CloverPit will cost $5 on mobile and it will have no microtransactions or ‚Äúpredatory mechanics.‚Äù That might seem surprising for a game centered around a slot machine, but CloverPit isn‚Äôt really about gambling (which the developers say they don‚Äôt like anyway). It‚Äôs about breaking the rules to tilt the odds in your favor.The setup is pretty straightforward. You‚Äôre imprisoned in a rusty cell and you have a rapidly increasing debt to pay off. The only way to do that, and hopefully leave through the door, is to earn enough coins from the slot machine to pay what you owe. There are more than 150 items (which are called charms here) to experiment with that affect things like the number of spins, how much each symbol or pattern is worth and how many tickets you earn. Tickets are what you need to buy more charms.Figuring out combinations of items that work well together is key to quickly scaling up the number of coins and tickets you can earn from each visit to the slot machine. Fail to pay off your debt by a deadline (i.e. after a certain number of spins) and it‚Äôs game over, as you plunge into the titular pit. CloverPit is strange and beguiling and heaps of fun. I‚Äôve plowed around 39 hours into it on Steam, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll take up much of my attention on my phone after it hits mobile next week. Doomspinning seems slightly healthier for my brain than doomscrolling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cloverpit-a-balatro-style-game-with-a-grungy-slot-machine-hits-ios-and-android-on-december-17-154500028.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cloverpit-a-balatro-style-game-with-a-grungy-slot-machine-hits-ios-and-android-on-december-17-154500028.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-10T15:45:25", "collected_date": "2025-12-10T20:04:01.635640", "language": "en", "tags": ["headline", "site|engadget", "gadgets", "author_name|Kris Holt", "Video Games", "provider_name|Engadget", "consumer", "technology", "region|US", "language|en-US", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 398, "author": "Kris Holt", "raw_content_length": 4447, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.99, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "3d8039442e4728931d0291e9a68904d6", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "The article functions as a positive review of the game, providing detailed gameplay analysis and personal endorsement.

The sale runs through November 4, and notably also includes discounts on several older games maintained as part of the GOG Preservation Program. The Autumn Sale includes sales on newer games like Cyberpunk 2077, which normally costs $60 but is available during the sale for $21, and the open-world game's excellent DLC, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, which you can pick up for $21, down from $30. GOG is also offering Silent Hill 2, the 2024 remake of the classic horror game, for 50 percent off, bringing its price down to $35. And if you're looking for something a little more ruminative, Disco Elysium - The Final Cut is 75 percent off, taking it from $40 to $10. GOG is best known for selling old games, and the Autumn Sale includes some great options there, too. While it's not that old, Doom (2016) for $4, which is 80 percent off its normal $20 price, is pretty hard to deny. There's also classics like Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition, which you can get for $10, down from $20. And EA gems like Spore Collection and SimCity 3000 Unlimited are also both 50 percent off, at $15 and $5, respectively. New Vegas, Spore and SimCity 3000 are all part of GOG's Preservation Program, which was formally launched in 2024 as a way to guarantee classic titles run on modern hardware, support controllers and more. Maintaining the program has apparently led to its fair share of headaches, though. \"To be perfectly honest, it's harder than we thought it would be,\" Marcin Paczynski, GOG’s senior business development manager, shared in an interview with The Game Business. \"what we’ve found out is that the games and how they work has deteriorated way faster than what we thought. And we are not talking only about the game not launching. We are talking about more subtle things as well.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gog-autumn-sale-discounts-cyberpunk-2077-silent-hill-2-and-fallout-new-vegas-221329021.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/gog-autumn-sale-discounts-cyberpunk-2077-silent-hill-2-and-fallout-new-vegas-221329021.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-28T22:13:37", "collected_date": "2025-10-29T01:59:08.963506", "language": "en", "tags": ["languageen-us", "video_games", "gadgets", "consumer", "technology", "headline", "siteengadget", "regionus"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 342, "author": "Ian Carlos Campbell", "raw_content_length": 8671, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.71, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["GOG", "the GOG Preservation Program", "Phantom Liberty", "GOG Autumn Sale discounts Cyberpunk 2077", "DLC"], "persons": ["Silent Hill 2", "Disco Elysium -

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_a9d4e91eb394", "title": "Self-Explaining Hate Speech Detection with Moral Rationales", "content": "arXiv:2601.03481v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Hate speech detection models rely on surface-level lexical features, increasing vulnerability to spurious correlations and limiting robustness, cultural contextualization, and interpretability. We propose Supervised Moral Rationale Attention (SMRA), the first self-explaining hate speech detection framework to incorporate moral rationales as direct supervision for attention alignment. Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp). Although explanations become more concise, sufficiency improves (+2.3 pp) and fairness remains stable, indicating more faithful rationales without performance or bias trade-offs", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03481", "published_date": "2026-01-08T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2026-01-09T04:02:05.780381", "language": "en", "tags": ["computer-science", "cs.CL", "research", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 180, "author": "Francielle Vargas, Jackson Trager, Diego Alves, Surendrabikram Thapa, Matteo Guida, Berk Atil, Daryna Dementieva, Andrew Smart, Ameeta Agrawal", "raw_content_length": 1499, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.9, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "b5be1f5e3b1bad5a8c28a4759d656805", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract for a scientific research paper, detailing a new framework, methodology, and experimental results.

While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_0c38876b2a88", "title": "Human", "content": "arXiv:2510.23476v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines, shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity, enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts, including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification, regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23476", "published_date": "2025-10-28T04:00:00",

These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic $K$-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L{\\\"o}h; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.",

However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.", "source":

This adaptive UI framework addresses the limitations of traditional static interfaces by integrating digital image processing, face recognition, and emotion detection techniques. Face2Feel analyzes user expressions utilizing a webcam or pre-installed camera as the primary data source to personalize the UI in real-time. Although dynamically changing user interfaces based on emotional states are not yet widely implemented, their advantages and the demand for such systems are evident. This research contributes to the development of emotion-aware applications, particularly in recommendation systems and feedback mechanisms. A case study, \"Shresta: Emotion-Based Book Recommendation System,\" demonstrates the practical implementation of this framework, the technologies employed, and the system's usefulness. Furthermore, a user survey conducted after presenting the working model reveals a strong demand for such adaptive interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user satisfaction and comfort in human-computer interaction. The results showed that nearly 85.7\\% of the users found these systems to be very engaging and user-friendly.

Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents.", "source": "science_arxiv_eess", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09372", "published_date": "2025-12-11T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-12-11T12:00:46.653404", "language": "en", "tags": ["systems", "eess.SY", "research", "electrical-engineering", "cs.SY", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "eess updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 186, "author": "Jingxuan Yang, Weichao Xu, Yuchen Shi, Yi Zhang, Shuo Feng, Huaxin Pei", "raw_content_length": 1586, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.93, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "c67f3c2112085e6e47b6a97fb712cd67", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract for a scientific research paper published on arXiv, a repository for academic preprints.

{"id": "ai_engadget_72de31309eb0", "title": "Prime Day deal: The Amazon Echo Spot alarm clock drops to $45", "content": "Amazon may have announced new Echo Show devices recently, but it didn't touch the humble Echo Spot. The smart alarm clock remains the smallest Echo device with a display, but it's one that's really best just for showing the time, weather and other quick bits of information. You can grab one now for only $45 thanks to Prime Day deals; that's 44 percent off its usual price. The latest incarnation of the diminutive Spot was introduced in July 2024, and this matches its record-low price. For that you get a comfortably bedside-sized device with a sharper display than its predecessor, as well as superior sound. The front face is divided into two halves, with a speaker positioned below the hemispherical display. What screen you do have is more than enough to display the time and weather information, plus it can show you the song or album title and accompanying artwork when you’re listening to music on those improved speakers. It can naturally be used to boss around your other connected smart devices, too. Alexa might be baked in, but the Echo Spot is intended to be a fairly bare-bones smart alarm clock, so don’t expect as many features as you’ll find on something like the Echo Show 5. But a lot of people just want a modern alarm clock, and arguably the biggest selling point for the Echo Spot is its total lack of a camera. While that means it can do less than the original 2017 Echo Spot, which Amazon did put a camera in, the decision to remove it from a device that lives right next to your bed was probably for the best. Amazon’s Prime Day sale returns on October 7, so you can expect a range of deals on its various Echo devices.

Typically, an SIS is modelled as a surface that imparts phase shifts on impinging electromagnetic signals to achieve desired communication objectives. However, this mode of operation results in a linear SIS, which limits its applicability to linear operations. To unlock further SIS potential, we propose a nonlinear SIS that can mimic the behaviour of nonlinear neural networks. We discuss the feasibility and potential of this idea and propose a nonlinear SIS unit cell with a step-like response. To evaluate the system-level performance of nonlinear SIS, we present a case study where SIS structures are optimized to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) in an MIMO system with SIS deployed at both the transmitter and receiver sides using only statistical channel information. We demonstrate that a nonlinear SIS can improve communication reliability compared to a linear SIS by forming complex signal patterns across the SIS surface, which provide higher diversity against noise disturbances, while still allowing the receiver to discern these patterns. Finally, we outline several potential applications of nonlinear SIS in wireless communication scenarios.", "source": "science_arxiv_eess", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "ai_engadget_b525fae78883", "title": "The best smart LED light bulbs for 2025", "content": "Smart LED light bulbs are one of the easiest ways to get into the IoT space. These smart lighting solutions let you control your home’s illumination from your phone and other connected devices, and in addition to that practicality, they also inject some fun into your space. Color-changing bulbs have a plethora of RGB options for you to customize the lighting mood for your next movie night, date night or game day, or you can opt for cozy warm white light when you need to unwind at the end of a long day.It goes without saying that many of these smart LED light bulbs work with Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant, so if you already have a smart home setup in the works, you can find one that fits into your chosen ecosystem. And arguably the best thing about these devices is that they can fit into any budget; affordable and advanced options have flooded the space over the past few years. We’ve tested out a bunch of smart lights over the years, and these are our current favorites. Table of contents Best smart lights for 2025 Other smart bulbs we tested What to look for in smart light bulbs Smart light bulb FAQs Best smart lights for 2025 Other smart bulbs we’ve tested Nanoleaf Smarter Kit While we’ve recommended Nanoleaf’s Smarter Kits in guides in the past, they’re a bit more niche than other smart lights on this list. They’re best for adding flare to your living room or game-streaming setup as they come in different shapes like hexagons and triangles and can sync with music. In addition to different colors, light animations and schedules, Nanoleaf’s Smart Kits also support Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. What to look for in smart light bulbs Connectivity (To hub or not to hub) One of the biggest appeals of smart lighting solutions is being able to control them from your phone. Most of them are able to do so by connecting to it via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, or via an external hub, which handles the connection for them. Bluetooth connectivity limits the range in which you’ll be able to control the light, so it’s only best for a limited number of bulbs and ones you don’t expect to control when you’re away. Wi-Fi color-changing bulbs are easy to set up and can be cheaper overall since they don’t require a hub to connect them. However, having something like a central Zigbee hub can make your whole system more reliable since its connection is separate from your home’s network. For that reason, hub-based bulbs tend to be more expandable, so we mainly recommend those if you want to eventually have dozens of smart lights around your home. White or color? Most color-changing bulbs you’ll find today are “white and color” bulbs, meaning they can glow in vibrant RGB color-options like blues, pinks, greens and everything in between, as well as shine with different temperatures of white. But there are some white-only bulbs out there, and they are often a bit more affordable than their color counterparts. While we recommend springing for the white-and-color devices, if you’d prefer white only, make sure you’re getting a bulb that can span the color temperature spectrum (typically from about 2000 to 5000 Kelvin), offering you various levels of cool and warm white light. App features One of the perks of smart lighting solutions is the amount of control you have over them thanks to their various app-control capabilities. Most companion apps let you do things like set lighting schedules and timers, group individual lights into room designations and create your own custom light “scenes” with different RGB options. But we have seen other features that aren’t as ubiquitous like vacation mode for automatically turning lights on and off to enhance your home security, and sync with media, which changes the colors of lights depending on the music you’re listening to or the game you’re currently live-streaming. Smart home compatibility If you use a smart assistant like Amazon’s Alexa or the Google Assistant regularly, make sure the smart lights or smart switches work with your favorite. All of the bulbs we tested supported both Amazon’s and Google’s virtual assistants, allowing you to use voice commands to turn lights on and off, dim them with a virtual dimmer and more. The wildcard here is Siri and Apple’s HomeKit; while numerous smart bulbs have added HomeKit support, not all lights are compatible with Apple’s smart home system. Expandability We alluded to this above, but you’ll want to consider how many smart lights you eventually want in your home. Some brands and lighting systems are easier to expand than others, and we generally recommend going for hub-based bulbs if you plan on putting smart lights in every room in your home. If you’re only looking to deck out your home office or living room with some fancy color-changing bulbs, Wi-Fi options should serve you well. Thankfully, these are some of the most affordable smart home devices you can get, so even if you don’t have a clear answer to this question now, you can reconsider your options down the line if you do decide to outfit your home with multiple smart bulbs. Smart light bulb FAQs What’s the best smart light bulb for Alexa? There is no best smart light bulb for Alexa. Amazon doesn’t make its own smart bulbs (like it does for smart plugs and thermostats), but rather there are dozens of smart lights made by third-parties that work with Alexa — including all of the ones we tested. Before picking the best smart light bulb for you, make sure to check the voice assistants that the contenders support. You’ll find that most smart light bulbs available today work with Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant, and plenty of them also have support for Apple’s Siri and HomeKit. Can you put a smart bulb in any lamp? Smart light bulbs can go into most modern light fixtures — but just like regular bulbs, they need to be the right shape/size for the fixture. A standard A19 smart light bulb should work properly in most table, floor and other lamps. If you have a fixture that takes a specific type of bulb, look for smart bulbs that will fit properly. Do smart light bulbs use electricity when off? Smart light bulbs do use a negligible amount of electricity when their fixtures are turned off. This is due to the fact that the smart bulb needs to stay in constant contact with your home’s internet connection or Bluetooth in order to work properly. However, their energy-saving benefits usually outweigh the small amount of power they consume even while turned off.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-143022856.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-13T09:00:52", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T12:55:22.170317", "language": "en", "tags": ["regionus", "lighting_accessories", "headline", "languageen-us", "gadgets", "consumer", "technology", "siteengadget"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 1129, "author": "Valentina Palladino", "raw_content_length": 8046, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 5.645, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Amazon’s Alexa", "RGB", "Google", "IoT"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 6645, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["you", "The best smart LED light bulbs", "Smart LED light bulbs", "the easiest ways", "the IoT space", "These smart lighting solutions", "your homes illumination", "your phone", "other connected devices", "addition"], "filter_categories": {"engineering": ["the IoT space"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"you": 4.0, "The best smart LED light bulbs": 2.0, "Smart LED light bulbs": 1.0, "the easiest ways": 1.0, "the IoT space": 1.0, "These smart lighting solutions": 1.0, "your homes illumination": 1.0, "your phone": 1.0, "other connected devices": 1.0, "addition": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 3.9848096152777774, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.818999999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.9638, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.515, "joy": 0.4349, "surprise": 0.026, "sadness": 0.0077, "fear": 0.0012, "anger": 0.0072, "disgust": 0.008}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "This article is a 'Best X to buy' listicle, explicitly recommending products ('our current favorites', 'Nanoleaf Smarter Kit') and providing a shopping guide ('What to look for in smart light bulbs').

{"id": "ai_engadget_102c419b5979", "title": "California introduces a one-stop shop to delete your online data footprint", "content": "Californians can now put a stop to their personal data being sold around on an online trading floor, thanks to a new free tool. On January 1, the state launched its Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, shortened to DROP, that allows residents to request to delete all of their personal information online that's been harvested by data brokers. According to the California Privacy Protection Agency (CalPrivacy), which was responsible for DROP's release, it's a \"first of its kind\" tool that imposes new restrictions on businesses that hoard and sell personal info that consumers didn't provide directly. The process requires verifying your California residency before you can send a \"single deletion request to every registered data broker in California.\" On the other end, CalPrivacy will require data brokers to register every year and to process any deletion requests from DROP. Data brokers will also have to report the type of information they collect and share, while also being subject to regular audits that check for compliance. If any data broker is found skirting the requirements, they could face penalties and fines. Besides being the first in the country to offer this type of comprehensive tool that deletes online personal data, CalPrivacy said it's one of four states, including Oregon, Texas and Vermont, to require data broker registration. According to the agency, data brokers will start processing the first deletion requests from DROP starting August 1, 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/california-introduces-a-one-stop-shop-to-delete-your-online-data-footprint-173102064.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/california-introduces-a-one-stop-shop-to-delete-your-online-data-footprint-173102064.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2026-01-03T17:31:15", "collected_date": "2026-01-04T00:02:29.520722", "language": "en", "tags": ["gadgets", "author_name|Jackson Chen", "technology", "region|US", "consumer", "provider_name|Engadget", "language|en-US", "Internet & Networking Technology", "headline", "site|engadget", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 242, "author": "Jackson Chen", "raw_content_length": 2191, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.21, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "rss_original", "content_length_chars": 1666}, "content_hash": "313bb9d7cbc0ffdc113619ef563423a4", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The article is a straightforward news report about a new consumer privacy tool launched by the California state government.

{"id": "ai_engadget_f8a32ec1c62f", "title": "This Ninja dual", "content": "Amazon Prime Day is officially here and there are deals running on everything from electronics to kitchen appliances. The latter includes a sale on Ninja's DZ302 10-quart Air Fryer with Dual Baskets, dropping its price from $230 to $160. The 30 percent discount brings the air fryer's price to just $10 more than its all-time low. The 10-quart Ninja DZ302 Air Fryer is a great investment for a lot of reasons, starting with its six settings. You can use it to air fry, air broil, bake, dehydrate, keep things warm and roast your food. Even better? It has two five-quart baskets that allow you to cook two different foods at two different settings. Also, despite it's capabilities, at under 15 inches, it doesn't take up too much counter top real estate (though it's probably too large for the smallest kitchens). The air fryer also comes with Ninja's Smart Finish feature, which ensures your two foods finish cooking at the same time. Plus, there's the Match Cook option which sets both baskets to the same instructions for when you're cooking one thing across both. Those two features are the main difference between the Ninja DZ302 and the 10-quart Ninja DZ401 Foodi — our pick for best dual-zone air fryer. But, otherwise, the latter will give you a very similar device for $130.

{"id": "portuguese_canaltech_d25984107205", "title": "Galaxy S23 ainda vale a pena Black Friday 2025 ou é melhor pegar um mais novo?", "content": "O Galaxy S23 continua sendo um dos smartphones mais procurados, mesmo após o lançamento das gerações S24 e S25 — e com o S26 chegando em fevereiro. Com a Black Friday 2025 se aproximando, muitos consumidores se perguntam se ainda faz sentido investir no modelo de 2023 ou se é melhor partir para algo mais recente. Quanto vale a pena pagar no Galaxy S23 Ultra na Black Friday 2025? Galaxy S23, S24 ou S25: qual é o ideal para comprar em 2025? A resposta depende de alguns fatores importantes, como orçamento, necessidades de uso e expectativa de durabilidade. Vamos analisar os pontos que pesam a favor e contra o Galaxy S23 em 2025. 📱 Veja as melhores promoções em celulares da Samsung no WhatsApp do CT Ofertas O que o Galaxy S23 ainda oferece em 2025? O aparelho traz o chipset Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, que continua entregando desempenho sólido para praticamente qualquer tarefa. Nenhum aplicativo disponível na Play Store representa desafio real para o processador, e até emuladores mais pesados funcionam bem. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Outro destaque é o conjunto de câmeras, que envelheceu bem. O sensor principal de 50 MP entrega nível de detalhes impressionante, ótimo alcance dinâmico (HDR) e contraste elevado. A lente ultrawide de 12 MP e a telefoto de 10 MP com zoom óptico de 3x completam um sistema fotográfico equilibrado. A tela Dynamic AMOLED de 6,1 polegadas com 120 Hz mantém qualidade visual excelente, com cores vibrantes e fluidez satisfatória. Além disso, o tamanho compacto agrada quem prefere aparelhos mais fáceis de manusear com uma mão. ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) ___________________ (Ivo Meneghel Jr/Canaltech) Atualizações garantidas até 2028 Um dos principais trunfos do Galaxy S23 em 2025 é o suporte prolongado de atualizações. A Samsung se comprometeu a atualizar o Android do aparelho até 2026 e fornecer patches de segurança até 2028. Isso significa que o dispositivo permanecerá relevante e protegido contra vulnerabilidades por mais três anos. Quem comprar o S23 agora ainda terá acesso a recursos lançados em futuras versões do Android, o que aumenta consideravelmente a longevidade do investimento. A Samsung também confirmou que o Galaxy S23 recebeu alguns recursos de inteligência artificial presentes no Galaxy AI, como Circule para Pesquisar e Tradução Ao Vivo para traduzir chamadas em tempo real. Como o Galaxy S23 se compara aos modelos mais novos? A linha Galaxy S24 trouxe melhorias pontuais em relação ao S23. O modelo base ganhou tela ligeiramente maior (6,2 polegadas), bordas mais finas e brilho superior. O processador Exynos 2400 do S24 base entrega desempenho semelhante ao Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. As câmeras são praticamente idênticas entre os dois modelos. O que muda é apenas o pós-processamento, com o S24 levando ligeira vantagem em exposição e tom de pele em fotos de pessoas.

O Galaxy S24 receberá updates até 2031, enquanto o S23 terá suporte até 2028. Para quem pretende trocar de celular em três ou quatro anos, essa diferença não pesa tanto. Já o Galaxy S25 chegou com Snapdragon 8 Elite em toda a linha e promessa de sete anos de atualizações. O salto de desempenho existe, mas para uso cotidiano, redes sociais e até jogos pesados, o Galaxy S23 continua dando conta do recado tranquilamente. Vale a pena comprar o Galaxy S23 na Black Friday 2025? Sim, o Galaxy S23 continua sendo uma excelente escolha para a Black Friday 2025, desde que comprado no preço certo. Para a versão de 256 GB, a mais recomendada, considerando que 128 GB pode não ser memória suficiente em 2025, o preço ideal deve ficar por volta de R$ 2.200 a R$ 2.300. O momento atual é favorável para adquirir o Galaxy S23. Com o lançamento das gerações S24 e S25, o varejo está repleto de estoque promocional. A Black Friday pode ser a última grande oportunidade de encontrar o aparelho novo com preços realmente atrativos. Em resumo, o Galaxy S23 ainda é o smartphone premium com a melhor relação custo-benefício da Samsung para quem não precisa do absolutamente mais recente e pode economizar sem abrir mão de desempenho sólido, câmeras competentes e suporte prolongado de atualizações. 🛒 Compre o Galaxy S23 na Magalu 🛒 Compre o Galaxy S23 no Mercado Livre 🛒 Compre o Galaxy S23 na Amazon Leia mais Ainda vale a pena comprar o Samsung Galaxy S23?

They include some games that were previously confirmed to join Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass on their release day, including Ball x Pit (October 15), Keeper (October 17) and Ninja Gaiden 4 (October 21).Starting today, Game Pass subscribers on the Ultimate, Premium and PC plans can try out a store management game called Supermarket Simulator. Baldur’s Gate 3 fans who have been meaning to check out the first two main entries in the series can hop into the enhanced editions on PC via the Ultimate, Premium and PC variants of Game Pass starting on October 9.On October 14, folks on those three Game Pass plans can get a pre-Halloween horror fix with The Casting of Frank Stone. This is a Dead by Daylight spinoff from Supermassive Games that taps into the kind of narrative-heavy gameplay the studio used in the likes of Until Dawn and The Quarry.The other remaining Game Pass additions for October are:The Grinch: Christmas Adventures – October 15 (Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass)Eternal Strands — October 15 (Game Pass Premium, already on Ultimate and PC Game Pass)He Is Coming (Game Preview on PC only) — October 15 (Game Pass Premium, already on Ultimate and PC Game Pass)Ninja Gaiden 2 Black – October 15 (Game Pass Premium, already on Ultimate and PC Game Pass)Pax Dei (PC) – October 16 (Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass)Evil West – October 21 (Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass)I played some of Eternal Strands earlier this year and dug it quite a bit. It’s an action-adventure game that lets you do some really neat things with elemental abilities. I enjoyed what I played of The Casting of Frank Stone too. That said, Ball x Pit (I got hooked on the demo this summer) and Keeper are the picks of this bunch for me.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-remaining-game-pass-additions-for-october-include-baldurs-gate-1-and-2-and-the-casting-of-frank-stone-172448097.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-remaining-game-pass-additions-for-october-include-baldurs-gate-1-and-2-and-the-casting-of-frank-stone-172448097.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-08T17:24:55", "collected_date": "2025-10-08T18:40:28.553490", "language": "en", "tags": ["gadgets", "siteengadget", "sports_recreation", "consumer", "headline", "languageen-us", "regionus", "technology"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 354, "author": "", "raw_content_length": 3880, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.77, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Microsoft", "Ultimate", "Supermarket Simulator", "Xbox", "Baldur"], "persons": ["Ball", "Baldur’s Gate", "Keeper"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2200, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["October", "Xboxs remaining Game Pass additions", "Baldurs Gate", "The Casting", "Frank Stone", "dozens", "more games", "the service", "a 50 percent price increase", "the Ultimate tier"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Xboxs remaining Game Pass additions"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"October": 6.0, "Xboxs remaining Game Pass additions": 2.0, "Baldurs Gate": 2.0, "The Casting": 2.0, "Frank Stone": 2.0, "dozens": 1.0, "more games": 1.0, "the service": 1.0, "a 50 percent price increase": 1.0, "the Ultimate tier": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 1.3442600302777776, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.7115, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.5423, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8745, "joy": 0.0517, "surprise": 0.0552, "sadness": 0.0082, "fear": 0.0019, "anger": 0.006, "disgust": 0.0025}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "The article primarily functions as an announcement of new content for a commercial subscription service (Xbox Game Pass).

The Cherenkov photons emitted following a neutrino interaction are detected by digital optical modules deployed along vertical strings within the ice. The densely instrumented bottom central region of the IceCube detector, known as DeepCore, is optimized to detect GeV-scale atmospheric neutrinos. As upward-going atmospheric neutrinos pass through Earth, matter effects alter their oscillation probabilities due to coherent forward scattering with ambient electrons. These matter effects depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the density distribution of electrons they encounter during their propagation. Using simulated data at the IceCube Deepcore equivalent to its 9.3 years of observation, we demonstrate that atmospheric neutrinos can be used to probe the broad features of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. In this contribution, we present the preliminary sensitivities for establishing the Earth matter effects, validating the non-homogeneous distribution of Earth's electron density, and measuring the mass of Earth. Further, we also show the DeepCore sensitivity to perform the correlated density measurement of different layers incorporating constraints on Earth's mass and moment of inertia.", "source":

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_eec1e5fcd658", "title": "Oil prices are down following Gaza ceasefire deal", "content": "Oil prices declined on Friday, after settling around 1.6% lower in the previous session, as the market’s risk premium faded after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a plan to end the war in Gaza. Brent crude futures were down 66 cents, or 1%, at $64.56 a barrel at 1016 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 61 cents, or 1%, to $60.90. “Finally having some kind of peace process in the Middle East is lowering the shoulders a little bit,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB. This could ease fears about crude carriers passing through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, he said. BOTH BENCHMARKS ON TRACK FOR WEEKLY GAINS Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas signed a ceasefire agreement on Thursday in the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the war in Gaza. Under the deal, which Israel’s government ratified on Friday, fighting will cease, Israel will partially withdraw from Gaza, and Hamas will free all remaining hostages it captured in the attack that precipitated the war, in exchange for hundreds of prisoners held by Israel. Numerous vessels have been attacked by the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen since 2023, targeting ships they deem linked to Israel in what they described as solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza. On a weekly basis, Brent was up around 1% and WTI was relatively flat, so far. Both benchmarks fell steeply last week. Prices climbed about 1% on Wednesday to a one-week high because of stalled progress on a Ukraine peace deal, a sign that sanctions against Russia, the world’s second-largest oil exporter, could continue. The Gaza ceasefire deal means the focus can move back to the impending oil surplus, as OPEC proceeds with the unwinding of production cuts, said Daniel Hynes, an analyst at ANZ. A smaller-than-expected November hike in output agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) on Sunday eased some of those oversupply concerns. “Markets’ expectations for a sharp ramp up in crude supply have not manifested themselves in substantially lower prices,” BMI analysts said in a note on Friday. “The most recent rise in production is lower than previously feared, contributing to a slight rise in prices for the week,” they said. Investors are also worried that a prolonged U.S. government shutdown could dampen the American economy and hurt oil demand in the world’s largest crude consumer.

It‚Äôs what repair gurus at iFixit want to solve with FixBot, an AI-enabled app that talks you through whatever repair you‚Äôre doing. The chatbot will help you diagnose the problem and then walk you step-by-step through the fix. Plus, it‚Äôs voice-enabled so you won‚Äôt have to get your phone all smeary when you‚Äôre elbows-deep in a job. After all, iFixit‚Äôs guides don‚Äôt just cover fixing your electronics, but everything you might fancy doing yourself, from appliances through to cars and trucks.Unlike traditional AIs, FixBot has been trained on iFixit‚Äôs library of 125,000 guides, its forum and database of repair manuals. The company says there‚Äôs less risk of hallucination as it pulls from and shows you the schematics it‚Äôs referencing to ensure you don‚Äôt order the wrong gear. Users can even upload images from their phone, so the app can point out which bit is which. The company is open about its limitations: It‚Äôs an AI, so it‚Äôs not bulletproof, and its knowledge only runs as far as its library. It can hunt elsewhere for manufacturer data and on other repair forums but you‚Äôll be warned about the information it pulls from it.In addition, FixBot will keep an eye on your phone‚Äôs battery health in real time to tell you when it‚Äôs time to get a replacement. The tool is, for now, in beta, thanks to the fuzzy way some companies track their battery health, but iFixit is promising greater detail than what you currently get. Plus, when it is time to swap out your battery, you can order the parts and kit all within the app. FixBot is launching for free on both the App Store and Google Play but it won‚Äôt remain that way forever. At some point, free users will switch to a version with access limits, and will be prompted to upgrade to the paid tier for $4.99 a month or $50 a year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/ifixits-new-app-uses-ai-to-help-you-repair-your-stuff-130000091.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/general/ifixits-new-app-uses-ai-to-help-you-repair-your-stuff-130000091.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-09T13:01:01", "collected_date": "2025-12-09T20:05:21.843257", "language": "en", "tags": ["gadgets", "consumer", "language|en-US", "Technology & Electronics", "author_name|Daniel Cooper", "region|US", "headline", "site|engadget", "technology", "Software", "provider_name|Engadget", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 346, "author": "Daniel Cooper", "raw_content_length": 4631, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.73, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "4d9e42ed8cd1388d660f9a529690f6eb", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "The article announces a new app, detailing its features and benefits.

A four-pack of Apple AirTags is down to $65 right now, which is 34 percent off its usual price and a sale hanging on after Prime Day ended earlier this week. That brings each AirTag in the bundle down to $16.25 each. If you're an Apple user, then the AirTag is the best Bluetooth tracker on the market for you. You can put these little discs in your wallet, in a backpack or in your luggage while you're traveling. Your AirTag's location will show up in your Find My app, powered by the vast network of iPhones, iPads and other compatible devices that receive the AirTag's Bluetooth signal. Keep in mind these only work when close enough to participating devices to be located. You can attach AirTags to just about anything thanks to an abundance of available accessories. Their built-in speakers can play a tone, triggered from your iPhone, to help you find them when the object they're affixed to is lost. On iPhone 11 and newer models, you can take advantage of the AirTag's Ultra Wideband capability and have your phone lead you right to your AirTag, complete with directional arrows on your iPhone screen.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/a-four-pack-of-airtags-is-cheaper-than-ever-right-now-143112964.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/a-four-pack-of-airtags-is-cheaper-than-ever-right-now-143112964.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-10T11:48:38", "collected_date": "2025-10-10T12:54:06.856666", "language": "en", "tags": ["consumer", "regionus", "languageen-us", "headline", "siteengadget", "gadgets", "technology"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 233, "author": "Andre Revilla", "raw_content_length": 2697, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.165, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Apple AirTags", "iPhones", "AirTags", "Apple", "AirTag", "Truly"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": ["16.25"]}, "char_count": 1419, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["you", "Truly good Apple deals", "A four-pack", "Apple AirTags", "which", "34 percent", "its usual price", "a sale", "Prime Day", "each AirTag"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Apple AirTags"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"you": 3.0, "Truly good Apple deals": 1.0, "A four-pack": 1.0, "Apple AirTags": 1.0, "which": 1.0, "34 percent": 1.0, "its usual price": 1.0, "a sale": 1.0, "Prime Day": 1.0, "each AirTag": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 1.1756544452777777, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.741999999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.9484, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9574, "joy": 0.0096, "surprise": 0.0146, "sadness": 0.0041, "fear": 0.003, "anger": 0.0054, "disgust": 0.0059}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 9.0, "reasoning": "This article is almost pure commerce content.

We present WebGraphEval, a framework that abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware evaluation of web agents.", "source":

Anti-virulence approaches targeting quorum sensing (QS) pathways offer a promising alternative by disarming pathogenicity, potentially without exerting selective pressure for resistance. In this study, we report the identification of two novel thiazole-indole hybrid compounds, namely 2-[(6-methoxy-1H-indol-2-yl)methyl]-5-cyano-1,3-thiazol-3-amine (designated C3) and 3-amino-5-cyano-2-(5-chloro-1H-indol-2-yl) thiazole (designated C4), as potent inhibitors of the S. aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) quorum sensing system. Building on two heterocyclic scaffolds commonly used in medicinal chemistry and associated with QS modulation, these synthetic small molecules act on the S. aureus AgrC QS receptor, attenuating virulence without affecting bacterial viability. Both compounds significantly reduced the production of secreted virulence factors without promoting biofilm formation, a known drawback of some other QS inhibitors. Furthermore, their activity extended to Staphylococcus lugdunensis, while sparing the commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, indicating pathogen-selective QS interference. These findings establish novel thiazole-indole hybrids as a promising chemotype for anti-virulence intervention and provide valuable chemical tools for probing agr-mediated regulation in Staphylococcus species.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.15.682726v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-16T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T18:40:26.249742", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "biology", "cutting-edge", "life-sciences", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 169, "author": "Wang, W., Singh, P.

{"id": "ai_engadget_cb4138dc91dd", "title": "OpenAI completes corporate reorganization with support from Microsoft", "content": "OpenAI has completed its long, drawn-out reorganization into a public benefit corporation, the company announced today in a blog post attributed to board of directors chair Bret Taylor. As part of the reorg, OpenAI's nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, will retain control of OpenAI's for-profit division and hold an equity stake in the company valued at approximately $130 billion. According to Taylor, the Foundation will gain additional control over the for-profit once it reaches an unspecified \"valuation milestone.\" Today's announcement wouldn't have been possible without acquiescence from Microsoft, which before OpenAI recently raised more startup capital, held a 32 percent stake in the company's for-profit unit. In blog post it published alongside OpenAI, the tech giant said it would have a 27 percent stake in the new PBC, valued at approximately $135 billion. That puts the total valuation of OpenAI’s for-profit at $500 billion. Before OpenAI and Microsoft signed a memorandum of understanding in September, negotiations between the two organizations were reported to be tense, with Microsoft showing signs it was drifting away from OpenAI by working more closely with Anthropic to integrate its Claude models into Copilot 365. Now that there's an agreement in place, it appears both sides made some tough compromises. Microsoft, for instance, will continue to hold IP rights to OpenAI's models and products through 2032, with those rights covering systems the company develops after declaring artificial general intelligence. On the subject of AGI, the two companies will hire an independent panel of experts to verify any claim OpenAI makes there, when and if it reaches that milestone. However, Microsoft has agreed to waive any IP rights as they relate to OpenAI's upcoming consumer hardware — that is, the devices the company is working on with former Apple designer Jony Ive. In exchange, OpenAI has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure cloud computing services — though Microsoft also agreed it would no longer have a \"right of first refusal\" to be OpenAI's cloud provider. In the end, the most important part of today’s announcement is that it clears the way for OpenAI to become a publicly traded company. Much of the company’s financial future depended on it successfully completing this transition, and now at least it doesn’t have that burden resting on its shoulders.

Archéologue à l’Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives (Inrap), il les rattache sans hésiter à l’époque médiévale, comme en atteste leur couleur grise. A l’évidence, ils ont été apportés là par ravinement, lors d’orages. Il soupçonne alors le site de recéler bien d’autres artefacts.\nQuelques jours passent, le docteur en archéologie retourne sur le terrain. Cette fois, il s’enfonce dans les broussailles et remarque, au pied de petits chênes verts noyés sous des buis, des pierres émergeant de 40 à 50 centimètres du sol. Trop alignées pour ne pas y déceler une intervention humaine. D’autres pierres sont disposées de telle façon qu’elles forment des angles, « ce qui n’est pas logique pour des terrasses ». Il constate alors que « ça va très loin » : ces vestiges se répartissent sur 3,5 hectares. L’année suivante, il réalise pendant ses vacances un sondage modeste (sur 4 mètres carrés) mais instructif : il découvre des morceaux de céramiques et un toit de lauze effondré.

{"id": "ai_engadget_07eb6b98cadb", "title": "Tesla used deceptive language to market Autopilot, California judge rules", "content": "Tesla’s sales in California should be suspended for 30 days because its marketing around Autopilot and Full Self-Driving misled consumers, a California administrative law judge has ruled. Back in 2022, the California DMV accused the automaker of using deceptive language to advertise those products and making it seem like its vehicles are capable of level 5 autonomous driving. Tesla has since added the word “Supervised” to the name of its Full Self-Driving assistance technology. As Bloomberg notes, the DMV asked the administrative law judge if a suspension is warranted based on the evidence it presented. Even though the judge has agreed that it is, the agency will give Tesla 90 days to explain its side and remove any untrue or misleading language in the marketing materials for the products. Tesla’s sales and manufacturing in California will only be suspended if it doesn’t comply within that timeframe.“We’re really asking Tesla to do their job, as they’ve done in other markets, to properly brand these vehicles,” said California DMV director, Steve Gordon, in a statement.A suspension in California could be devastating for the automaker. While new Tesla registrations in the state plummeted earlier this year, Reuters says California accounts for nearly a third of the company’s sales in the country. In addition, Tesla only manufactures its Model S and X vehicles in its Fremont plant, where it also produces Model 3 and Model Y units.

{"id": "science_arxiv_eess_e72a3e652d8f", "title": "Joint Power Control and Antenna Positioning for Uplink RSMA in Pinching Antenna Systems", "content": "arXiv:2512.19963v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper investigates a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for uplink pinching antenna system (PASS). Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence.

{"id": "ai_engadget_089b59188653", "title": "New Philo subscribers can get their first month of access for $25", "content": "Philo has a decent discount for newcomers who are looking for a solid bundle of live TV channels and on-demand streaming services. New subscribers can get their first month of access to the Core plan for $25. That's a discount of $8. For your 25 bucks, you'll gain access to more than 70 channels, including AMC, BBC America, Comedy Central, Food Network, Hallmark Channel, several MTV stations, Nickelodeon and TLC. AMC+, HBO Max basic with ads and Discovery+ are included at no extra cost. Philo is our pick for the best cheap live TV streaming service. Having unlimited DVR is welcome and recordings expire after one year, which is three months longer than many competing platforms. There's no contract either, so you can cancel at any time. The platform also offers more than 110 free channels, but unfortunately there are no local channels and there's not much in the way of sports programming. Other notable channels, such as Bravo and Freeform are missing too. However, if the lineup of channels and streaming services covers all your needs, Philo is a solid streaming option, especially with the discount.

However, prompts sent to cloud-hosted models can contain personally identifiable information (PII) that users do not want logged, retained, or leaked. We observe this to be especially acute when users discuss friends, coworkers, or adversaries, i.e., when they spill the tea. Enterprises face the same challenge when they want to use LLMs for internal communication and decision-making. In this whitepaper, we present Whistledown, a best-effort privacy layer that modifies prompts before they are sent to the LLM. Whistledown combines pseudonymization and $\\epsilon$-local differential privacy ($\\epsilon$-LDP) with transformation caching to provide best-effort privacy protection without sacrificing conversational utility. Whistledown is designed to have low compute and memory overhead, allowing it to be deployed directly on a client's device in the case of individual users. For enterprise users, Whistledown is deployed centrally within a zero-trust gateway that runs on an enterprise's trusted infrastructure. Whistledown requires no changes to the existing APIs of popular LLM providers.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13319", "published_date":

{"id": "ai_engadget_d2ed6366e684", "title": "SteelSeries' updated Nova 7 gaming headset offers much better battery life", "content": "SteelSeries just released a refresh of its popular Arctis Nova 7 midrange gaming headset. The Nova 7 Gen 2 offers significantly improved battery life, with an increase of around 40 percent when compared to the original version. This translates to 54 hours of use per charge, which is a mighty fine metric. There's quick-charging that can provide six more hours of use in 15 minutes at the outlet. It charges via USB-C and can simultaneously play audio from both a 2.4GHz wireless connection and Bluetooth audio. This means that users can mix and match audio sources, which comes in handy when gaming. The headset connects wirelessly to all major gaming consoles, in addition to PCs and phones. The Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 integrates with the company's mobile app. This offers more than 200 presets for specific games, all of which adjust the EQ to match what's being played. On PC, the presets will automatically adjust depending on the game. These are headphones intended for gaming, so they also include a noise-cancelling microphone. This little boom mic can be hidden within the headset and disabled when using a standalone microphone. As for aesthetics, the Nova 7 looks a lot like the company's high-end headsets. It's available in three colors, including black, white and magenta. The headset is available to purchase right now and costs $200. It does lack a few features included with its higher-priced cousins, like the swappable battery system and active noise cancellation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/steelseries-updated-nova-7-gaming-headset-offers-much-better-battery-life-171435527.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/steelseries-updated-nova-7-gaming-headset-offers-much-better-battery-life-171435527.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-14T17:14:45", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T18:40:33.817741", "language": "en", "tags": ["gadgets", "siteengadget", "audio_technology", "languageen-us", "consumer", "technology", "headline", "regionus"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 252, "author": "Lawrence Bonk", "raw_content_length": 2729, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.26, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["The Nova 7 Gen 2", "Nova", "SteelSeries"], "persons": ["Arctis Nova 7"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1666, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["SteelSeries", "much better battery life", "use", "a refresh", "The Nova 7 Gen", "significantly improved battery life", "an increase", "around 40 percent", "the original version", "54 hours"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"SteelSeries": 3.0, "much better battery life": 2.0, "use": 2.0, "a refresh": 1.0, "The Nova 7 Gen": 1.0, "significantly improved battery life": 1.0, "an increase": 1.0, "around 40 percent": 1.0, "the original version": 1.0, "54 hours": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 1.5380528022222222, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.511000000000001, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.9022, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8981, "joy": 0.0311, "surprise": 0.0552, "sadness": 0.0039, "fear": 0.0008, "anger": 0.0066, "disgust": 0.0043}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "The article is a detailed product announcement and review, focusing entirely on the features, improvements, and specifications of a new gaming headset.

While conceptual frameworks define what constitutes explainable AI (XAI) and qualitative studies identify clinician needs, little practical guidance exists for development teams to prepare AI systems prior to clinical evaluation. We propose two foundational design principles, Transparent Design and Operable Design, that operationalize pre-clinical technical requirements for healthcare AI. Transparent Design encompasses interpretability and understandability artifacts that enable case-level reasoning and system traceability. Operable Design encompasses calibration, uncertainty, and robustness to ensure reliable, predictable system behavior under real-world conditions. We ground these principles in established XAI frameworks, map them to documented clinician needs, and demonstrate their alignment with emerging governance requirements. This pre-clinical playbook provides actionable guidance for development teams, accelerates the path to clinical evaluation, and establishes a shared vocabulary bridging AI researchers, healthcare practitioners, and regulatory stakeholders. By explicitly scoping what can be built and verified before clinical deployment, we aim to reduce friction in clinical AI translation while remaining cautious about what constitutes validated, deployed explainability.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01902", "published_date": "2025-11-05T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-11-05T06:40:11.223794", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "computer-science", "preprints", "csai", "cscy", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 187, "author": "Alexander Bakumenko (Clemson University, USA), Aaron J.

Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs",

{"id": "ai_engadget_8d6ccf82414b", "title": "Instagram Stories is getting new AI", "content": "Meta is bringing more of its generative AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories. With the changes, you can now use text prompts to remove or change objects in your photos or \"restyle\" the image completely.The new tools live in a new \"restyle\" menu at the top of the Stories composer. You can select \"add,\" \"remove\" or \"change\" to tweak specific elements of your images. These features work a lot like either AI-based image editing tools; you can do things like remove stray objects from the backgrounds of photos or change up a person's outfit. You can also make more dramatic edits, like in the photo below, when I asked Meta AI to \"change the background to make it look like the cat is in space.\" I asked Meta AI to \"make it look like the cat is in space.\"Screenshot via InstagramThe prompt bar can also be used to iterate on images without the \"add, change, remove\" constraints. It still takes a couple seconds for Meta AI to come up with its creations, but it‚Äôs an overall much faster and smoother experience than the company‚Äôs first ‚Äúimagine‚Äù image generator from nearly two years ago.Meta has also added some preset effects that change the style of an entire image (e.g. anime, watercolor, 8-bit) without a prompt. There are also some presets specifically for \"short videos,\" according to Meta, though I'm only seeing restyle options for photos for now.You can prompt Meta AI to edit your photos in Stories,MetaMeta is also testing some \"restyle\" effects for text within Stories posts. This will allow people to mix things up from the same few font styles Instagram typically has available. Like with the image edits, you can ask Meta to customize the look of your words (e.g \"make it look like toy blocks\").The changes will make Meta AI's image and video editing features much more prominent to Instagram users, Meta AI has had the ability to change and restyle images for some time, but those features have been confined to chats with the Meta AI assistant. By now adding text-based prompts directly to Stories, these tools are a lot more accessible. Instagram is further encouraging users to share their new AI-inspired creations with a new \"add yours\" sticker that lets people share prompts others can iterate on.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_639e0dec829e", "title": "LH2Face: Loss function for Hard High", "content": "arXiv:2506.23555v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR) algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face). Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving 49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method by 2.37%.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23555", "published_date": "2025-10-14T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T06:39:39.220414", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "cscv", "research", "computer-science", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 205, "author": "Fan Xie, Yang Wang, Yikang Jiao, Zhenyu Yuan, Congxi Chen, Chuanxin Zhao", "raw_content_length": 1498, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.025, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["LH2Face", "PDF", "the Probability Density Function", "multi-classificati"], "persons": ["Loss"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1497, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["LH2Face", "Loss function", "Hard High", "arXiv250623555v3 Announce Type", "Abstract", "current practical face authentication systems", "most face recognition", " algorithms", "cosine similarity", "softmax classification"], "filter_categories": {"hydrogen_energy": ["LH2Face"], "ai_ml": [" algorithms"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"LH2Face": 2.0, "Loss function": 2.0, "Hard High": 2.0, "arXiv250623555v3 Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "current practical face authentication systems": 1.0, "most face recognition": 1.0, " algorithms": 1.0, "cosine similarity": 1.0, "softmax classification": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.768092467222222, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 5.1290000000000004, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.0258, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.7581, "joy": 0.0028, "surprise": 0.0172, "sadness": 0.0358, "fear": 0.0782, "anger": 0.0521, "disgust": 0.0558}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The article is an abstract for a scientific research paper, as indicated by the 'arXiv' source and highly technical content.

However, existing tools often struggle to extract and structure multimodal, varied, and inconsistent information across documents into standardized formats. We introduce SciDaSynth, a novel interactive system powered by large language models (LLMs) that automatically generates structured data tables according to users' queries by integrating information from diverse sources, including text, tables, and figures. Furthermore, SciDaSynth supports efficient table data validation and refinement, featuring multi-faceted visual summaries and semantic grouping capabilities to resolve cross-document data inconsistencies. A within-subjects study with nutrition and NLP researchers demonstrates SciDaSynth's effectiveness in producing high-quality structured data more efficiently than baseline methods. We discuss design implications for human-AI collaborative systems supporting data extraction tasks.

{"id": "ai_engadget_582aa5255676", "title": "Spotify partners with the big three music labels on 'artist", "content": "Spotify sees the music industry's AI problem, and it's going to do… something about it. On Thursday, the company published a blog post heavy on principles, partnerships and vague plans. Unfortunately, it's practically devoid of specifics. The most explicit bit is that it's partnering with the big three music labels. Together, they'll \"develop responsible AI products that empower the artists and songwriters they represent, and connect them with the fans who support them.\" The move follows Spotify's announcement last month that it would clean up the AI slop proliferating on its platform. The company frames today's news as a direct defense against competition from unauthorized AI music production. \"If the music industry doesn't lead in this moment, AI-powered innovation will happen elsewhere, without rights, consent or compensation,\" the company wrote. Spotify says artists don’t find that current AI tools are “built to power their careers, their businesses, and their fan bases.” That will inform whatever comes out of the partners’ plans. \"We’ll develop new products for artists and fans through upfront agreements, not by asking for forgiveness later,\" the company wrote. Spotify laid out four principles that will guide its hazy plans for \"artist-first AI music products.\" The first is through partnerships with labels, distributors, and publishers. (In addition to the big three of Sony, Universal and Warner, Spotify is partnering with digital rights company Merlin and the French music label Believe.) The other tenets include choice in participation, fair compensation and artist-fan connections. Although it's been forced to clean up the AI mess that grew on its platform, Spotify has adopted AI features of its own. Most notably, that includes its AI DJ.

According to an Insider Gaming report, a new game for the Alien franchise is back in development. The report's sources mentioned that the single-player game will be set in a \"decaying space station\" as an arcade survival horror that can be compared to \"Shadow of [the] Tomb Raider with Xenomorphs.\" It's not the first time we heard about this Alien game, which was first reported on in 2022 under the codename \"Marathon.\" According to Insider Gaming, the game has cycled through several developers, but more recently landed with Eidos Montreal, which developed Shadow of the Tomb Raider and is currently working on the upcoming Fable reboot. The report added that the game's development budget was increased to less than $75 million, up from the initial $30 million budget from a few years ago. Insider Gaming's report noted that the game is still in \"early development,\" but could feature Ripley 8, the human-Xenomorph hybrid that was first seen in Alien Resurrection. The game's details and release date are still subject to change, but Insider Gaming's sources said the game is \"in a good place at this point\" and is expected to release in 2028 on all platforms.

By organizing satellites into autonomous blocks, BlockFLEX establishes a survivable underlay network that masks network volatility and offers a stable overlay view. The architecture employs a hierarchical routing scheme integrating both convergence-free geographic routing and convergence-isolated routing. Furthermore, BlockFLEX adaptively switches between stateful and stateless forwarding modes, enabling efficient, resilient, and stable routing via a dedicated protection mechanism and an optimized source satellite selection algorithm. Experimental evaluations on current operational LEO satellite networks (LSNs) demonstrate that under scenarios with up to 30\\% random link failures, the proposed method achieves a $2\\times$ improvement in reachability compared to current leading schemes, while maintaining near-100\\% routing availability. Moreover, the overhead of control messages and forwarding information base (FIB) updates remains below $0.2\\%$ of that in OSPF, accompanied by a $\\geq 36\\%$ reduction in routing computation time and a $\\geq 50\\%$ decrease in latency jitter.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09453", "published_date": "2025-12-11T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-12-11T16:04:45.865937", "language": "en", "tags": ["computer-science", "research", "cs.NI", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 176, "author": "Xiangtong Wang", "raw_content_length": 1366, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.88, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "cb77fe0d1dc8edfd353ea764dccb7b9c", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract from a scientific research paper, detailing a new architecture ('BlockFLEX') and its performance improvements in LEO satellite networks.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_d51a3e58bc3c", "title": "Breaking ECDSA with Electromagnetic Side", "content": "arXiv:2512.07292v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Smartphones handle sensitive tasks such as messaging and payment and may soon support critical electronic identification through initiatives such as the European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet, currently under development. Yet the susceptibility of modern smartphones to physical side-channel analysis (SCA) is underexplored, with recent work limited to pre-2019 hardware. Since then, smartphone system on chip (SoC) platforms have grown more complex, with heterogeneous processor clusters, sub 10 nm nodes, and frequencies over 2 GHz, potentially complicating SCA. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of electromagnetic (EM) SCA on a Raspberry Pi 4, featuring a Broadcom BCM2711 SoC and a Fairphone 4 featuring a Snapdragon 750G 5G SoC. Using new attack methodologies tailored to modern SoCs, we recover ECDSA secrets from OpenSSL by mounting the Nonce@Once attack of Alam et al. (Euro S&P 2021) and show that the libgcrypt countermeasure does not fully mitigate it. We present case studies illustrating how hardware and software stacks impact EM SCA feasibility. Motivated by use cases such as the EUDI wallet, we survey Android cryptographic implementations and define representative threat models to assess the attack.

Incorporating multiple reference models has the potential to address these limitations by broadening perspectives, reducing bias, and leveraging the strengths of diverse open-source LLMs. However, integrating multiple reference models into reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) frameworks poses significant theoretical challenges, where achieving exact solutions has remained an open problem. This paper presents the first \\emph{exact solution} to the multiple reference model problem in reverse KL-regularized RLHF. We introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework that includes rigorous statistical analysis and provides sample complexity guarantees. Additionally, we extend our analysis to forward KL-regularized RLHF, offering new insights into sample complexity requirements in multiple reference scenarios. Our contributions lay the foundation for more advanced and adaptable LLM alignment techniques, enabling the effective use of multiple reference models.

{"id": "science_biorxiv_559f645cd7b6", "title": "Locked Nucleic Acid Stabilized Liquid Crystalline Phases", "content": "Liquid crystalline (LC) phases formed by gapped DNA (GDNA) constructs, where two rigid duplexes are connected with a flexible single stranded linker, offer a versatile platform to investigate interactions between DNA molecules. Base pairs containing a locked nucleic acid (LNA-DNA or LNA-LNA pairs) are generally more stable compared to DNA-DNA pairs due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and/or attractive base stacking interactions. In concentrated solutions of GDNA constructs, the stability of terminal base pairs and the base stacking interactions between neighboring duplexes are critical for the formation of a bilayer smectic phase. By using temperature-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, we quantified the impact of single LNA modification of terminal base pairs on the thermal stability of smectic LC phases. We observe that LNA-DNA terminal AT base pairing (A+T) increases the stability of the bilayer smectic phase by ~9-18 {degrees}C relative to DNA-DNA pairing at the same duplex concentrations. While relatively large, this increase is still significantly less than the up to ~30 {degrees}C increase observed when AT DNA-DNA pairs are replaced by GC pairs, suggesting the stacking interactions between A+T LNA-DNA base pairs are significantly weaker than those between unmodified GC base pairs. Our study illustrates the sensitivity of LC ordering in dense DNA solutions to a single nucleotide modification and demonstrates that LNA modifications can provide a new mechanism for tuning the stability of nucleic acid-based materials.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.16.682820v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-16T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-17T01:51:30.039180", "language": "en", "tags": ["biology", "life-sciences", "preprints", "cutting-edge", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 229, "author": "Kodikara, S.

These visual updates and new features will roll out globally starting this week.The main update to YouTube is a redesigned video player that has made the icons and UI elements to obscure less content. This new player design will appear on mobile, web and TV devices. Some users have had access to this feature for about a month, so it may not be brand new to everyone. The seek feature where a viewer can double-tap to skip has also been updated in a way that YouTube says is \"more modern and less intrusive\" and transitions between tabs have also been upgraded on mobile.For those of you who spend a lot of time in the comments, you'll see a new threaded approach to replies. This update aims \"to provide a more focused reading experience within the replies panel.\" The process of adding videos to playlists and the Watch Later queue has also been simplified and adjusted to be a \"smoother and more visual\" experience. Finally, some content will start displaying little animations when you hit the like button. The blog post gives music videos and sports videos as examples of where users may start seeing the flashier visual.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-rolls-out-its-redesigned-video-player-globally-174609883.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/youtube/youtube-rolls-out-its-redesigned-video-player-globally-174609883.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-14T18:16:59", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T18:40:33.815974", "language": "en", "tags": ["gadgets", "social_online_media", "siteengadget", "languageen-us", "consumer", "technology", "headline", "regionus"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 217, "author": "", "raw_content_length": 1973, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.085, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["YouTube"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1375, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["YouTube", "its redesigned video player", "a wave", "quality", "life improvements", "its platform", "These visual updates", "new features", "The main update", "a redesigned video player"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["The main update"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"YouTube": 4.0, "its redesigned video player": 2.0, "a wave": 1.0, "quality": 1.0, "life improvements": 1.0, "its platform": 1.0, "These visual updates": 1.0, "new features": 1.0, "The main update": 1.0, "a redesigned video player": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 0.5007968422222222, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 6.591, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.3182, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9424, "joy": 0.0065, "surprise": 0.034, "sadness": 0.0085, "fear": 0.0015, "anger": 0.0044, "disgust": 0.0027}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The article is pure news reporting about a platform update (YouTube's redesigned video player and new features).

{"id": "ai_engadget_722f97d845b0", "title": "The best Amazon Prime Day kitchen deals include up to 50 percent off our favorite air fryers", "content": "New gear can make cooking easier (and sometimes more fun) but the best kitchen tech isn’t cheap. So it’s a good idea to wait for a sale like Amazon's Prime Day. For this October Prime Day sale, the deals have started early — and we've already found plenty of our recommended cooking gear on sale. Deals include air fryers from Ninja, Instant Pot cookers, a Breville juicer and even our top ice cream maker. We’ve linked to our testing and reviews so you can get the information you need before you buy. We'll update this guide as more kitchen stuff goes on sale, so check back. But for now, here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $200 ($55 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $180 ($50 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Note the price was $20 lower for Prime members back in July. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-193009691.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-193009691.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-03T17:42:52", "collected_date": "2025-10-03T18:38:07.777904", "language": "en", "tags": ["regionus", "languageen-us", "technology", "gadgets", "food_cooking", "consumer", "headline", "siteengadget"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 928, "author": "Amy Skorheim", "raw_content_length": 19012, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 4.64, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Ninja, Instant Pot", "Amazon"], "persons": [], "locations": ["Breville", "Ninja Creami"], "monetary": ["200"]}, "char_count": 5226, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["you", "up to 50 percent", "our favorite air fryers", "New gear", "cooking", "sometimes more fun", "the best kitchen tech", "a good idea", "a sale", "Amazons Prime Day"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["our favorite air fryers"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"you": 3.0, "up to 50 percent": 2.0, "our favorite air fryers": 2.0, "New gear": 1.0, "cooking": 1.0, "sometimes more fun": 1.0, "the best kitchen tech": 1.0, "a good idea": 1.0, "a sale": 1.0, "Amazons Prime Day": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 1.0057516563888889, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.886, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.9772, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 9.0, "reasoning": "This article is a pure promotional shopping guide for Amazon Prime Day.

{"id": "ai_engadget_43f9a17b8ca5", "title": "Black Friday Apple deals include the AirPods 4 for $90", "content": "Apple's AirPods 4 have dropped back down to a record low price in an early Black Friday deal on Amazon. If you aren't looking for active noise cancellation, the model without ANC is a steal at 30 percent off, bringing it down to just $90 from its usual price of $130. The ANC version is on sale too, for anyone not on as tight a budget. AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation are going for $150 right now, down from $180. The Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models. They offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price. This model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem. With the ANC version, you also have access to Live Translation, which can be initiated by pressing and holding the stem on both AirPods simultaneously. You can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case. On the other model with ANC active, that play time drops by about an hour. Check out our coverage of the best Apple deals for more discounts, and follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

{"id": "ai_engadget_391e4d07e2ac", "title": "ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X review: An extra life for Xbox", "content": "Xbox is at a crossroads. While the PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 continue to gain popularity, multiple price hikes for the Xbox Series S and X have killed their momentum. And with several big box retailers like Costco deciding to drop Microsoft’s console from their shelves, the current-gen Xbox may be dead in the water. So what should the company do? Microsoft’s most straightforward option would be to simply punt the end of the Xbox's lifecycle, regroup and come back strong with a brand new console in a year or two. On the flipside, the company could follow in Sega's footsteps after the untimely demise of the Dreamcast and become a cross-platform game publisher with a large stable of first-party studios. However, there's a third route that could fill the gap between now and whenever the next Xbox arrives that could potentially expand its reach to a whole new segment: Give handheld gaming a go. Engineering and building a new portable gaming device isn't cheap or quick. So instead of doing everything itself, Microsoft teamed up with ASUS to create the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X — a pair of Windows 11-based portable gaming PCs enhanced with Microsoft's DNA. And while it's too early to say if these handhelds will help save Xbox itself, they're more than solid portables that could have a big impact on portable gaming going forward. Editor's note: This review is focused on the ROG Xbox Ally X, primarily because that's all we have at the moment. However, the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X share many features including the same basic design , display, button layout and software (the only difference is their color). That said, the base Xbox Ally has less impressive specs as it comes with a slower AMD Ryzen Z2 chip, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a smaller 60WHr battery. It’s also a touch lighter (1.48 pounds vs 1.58) and has a lower price of $600 instead of $1,000. Design and display: The Xbox goes portable Sam Rutherford for Engadget When you look at the ROG Xbox Ally X, it might appear as if ASUS bolted larger grips to its previous handheld — the Ally X — and called it a day. However, the company says the Xbox Ally was redesigned from the ground up, in large part to include a number of signature features that will make Xbox faithful feel right at home. This includes things like the classic ABXY button layout, Impulse triggers with tons of travel and, of course, the requisite Xbox home button. Then smack dab in the middle of everything is a 7-inch IPS LCD screen. Speaking of the display, ASUS picked a FHD IPS panel with a 120Hz refresh rate that appears to be the exact same screen used on the Ally X. While it doesn't deliver pure blacks like you'd get from OLED, contrast was still surprisingly good. With a brightness of 500 nits (the one on our review unit was actually a touch higher at 510 nits), this display delivers almost everything you want without feeling like you need to upgrade to something like the huge 8.8-inch OLED panel on the Lenovo Legion Go 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Around back, there are two customizable paddles while the top edge houses a fingerprint reader and all of the Xbox Ally X's connectivity: two USB-C ports, a microSD card reader and 3.5mm audio. Notably, while both ports support charging and display capabilities, the one furthest to the left is also Thunderbolt 4 compliant. This means it has enough bandwidth to support external GPUs like ASUS' recently updated XG Mobile graphics dock. Ultimately, the ROG Xbox Ally might not look all that different from ASUS' previous handhelds, but between its buttons, triggers and those big new grips, it really does feel like you're holding a portable version of Microsoft's console. Even without Hall Effect sensors, the Xbox Ally X's joysticks are tight and responsive, while the triggers offer a ton of travel. The only thing I wish ASUS and Microsoft had paid a little more attention to is the handheld's haptics, which are fine, but they’re a far cry from the expressive rumble motors you get from a DualSense controller or the Switch 2's Joy-Con. Performance: Flagship handheld power Sam Rutherford for Engadget As the higher-end model in ASUS and Microsoft's new joint handheld lineup, the ROG Xbox Ally X features a AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip with 24GB of memory (which is shared with its GPU) and 1TB of storage that can be expanded via microSD. However, thanks in part to the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft tweaked a number of the handheld's background processes and services for the first time on a Windows 11-based handheld. The result is a slightly more optimized device even when compared to its closest rivals. In Cyberpunk 2077 at 1,920 x 1,080, medium graphics and FSR set to performance, the ROG Xbox Ally X hit 62.1 fps while plugged in and set to its max 35-watt Turbo mode. That's almost five fps higher than what we got from the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (57.5 fps) when its settings are similarly maxed out. Admittedly, this might not sound like a huge improvement, but it ends up being an extra seven percent performance from the same chip, which ain't bad. Meanwhile in Returnal, I got similar numbers after switching to the Ally's more energy-efficient 17-watt Performance Mode (unplugged), where it produced 42 fps at full HD on medium versus 39 fps for the Lenovo. Sam Rutherford for Engadget That said, it's important to note that the Ally's performance changes depending on whether it's plugged into the wall or not. If you want its full 35-watt Turbo Mode, you're going to need to use a power adapter, while its 17-watt Performance and 13-watt Silent modes stay the same no matter what you do. There’s also a manual performance customization tool, but to access it, you'll need to switch over to ASUS' Armoury Crate app, as there isn't a place to change things directly inside the Xbox app. Software: The tailored gaming experience we needed Getting excited about the software on a gaming handheld is usually pretty difficult. However, between the aforementioned tweaks to background services and the new full-screen Xbox experience, Microsoft has managed to remove a ton of the clunkiness that typically plagues other Windows-based gaming handhelds. Instead of having to wade your way through the traditional Windows desktop before booting into a game, now you're greeted by the Xbox app upon startup (and even during initial setup), so there are fewer steps to get between you and your favorite title. Furthermore, Microsoft has come up with a revamped layout that makes core features super easy to find. The Home tab is where all your installed software is, while there are other dedicated sections for Game Pass downloads (assuming you have a subscription) cloud gaming/remote play (also via Game Pass) and the Microsoft Store. If you prefer other digital marketplaces like Steam or Epic, there are shortcuts to download installers for those stores (and a few more like GOG and Ubisoft) in the My Apps tab. You don't need to open a web browser and do things manually. To switch between apps in Microsoft's new full-screen Xbox experience, all you need to do is swipe up from the bottom of the ROG Xbox Ally X's screen. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Furthermore, hitting the Xbox button summons a handful of quick settings for all sorts of things, including the Command Center for performance, toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, your Xbox friends list and a whole lot more. It's kind of like a do-everything button and it makes accessing almost all of your most important tools and features quick and easy. On top of that, there are new gestures that you can access by swiping in on the screen in different directions. Dragging your finger in from the left calls up the Xbox Game Bar overlay, even when you're in the middle of playing a game, while swiping in from the right opens your Windows notifications. But my favorite command is swiping up from the bottom, which is a new way to switch between apps (or a cooler version of Alt + Tab, depending on how you look at it). From there, you can even scroll through any programs that are currently open just by tapping the Xbox Ally's shoulder buttons. If you want to use the handheld like a real PC, you can also activate the Windows desktop from there too. Microsoft has also thoughtfully included compatibility tags on a number of games in its store to give buyers a sense of how well a game will run on the ROG Xbox Ally X. Sam Rutherford for Engadget The redesigned Xbox experience is very breezy and handles 90 to 95 percent of your traditional gaming functions, but there are still times when some of Window's underlying awkwardness shows through. Most often, I found this happens when exiting a game from a third-party store, where the Xbox Ally will spit you out into your Steam library (for example), where you'll often have to rely on touchscreen controls instead of the joysticks or the desktop mode's mouse cursor to navigate around. It's not a big deal compared to other Windows-based handhelds, and even though Microsoft has taken a big step forward on the Xbox Ally, there is still a little polishing to be done. Battery life: A solid jump in longevity One of the biggest benefits of going with the ROG Xbox Ally X is that it comes with a larger 80WHr battery than the base model (60Whr). When that is combined with improved energy efficiency from its new chip, you get very solid battery life — just as long as you don’t max out the power settings. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I tested this by playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 at full HD on medium settings and max brightness (Protip: don’t do this at night if you want to get to sleep on time) and the Xbox Ally X lasted just shy of three and a half hours. That’s 30 minutes longer than what I got from the Legion Go 2, although considering the latter has a much larger screen (with the same 500 nits of brightness), that difference wasn’t a big shock. The bigger revelation is that when compared to the original Ally X, ASUS and Microsoft’s new jointly-made device provided an extra hour of runtime, which could make a meaningful difference on a long trip. Wrap-up While Microsoft’s first real foray into PC gaming handhelds isn’t upending the status quo and it’s way too early to say if this gadget will save Xbox as a whole, it is bringing some notable advancements. The new full-screen experience makes launching and playing games on Windows-based devices so much more seamless that it’s kind of wild it took so long to get here. Sure, there are still a few edge cases where you’ll have to tap the screen or flip between the Xbox app and ASUS’ Armoury Create to tweak certain settings, but compared to most of its rivals, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a massive upgrade in general usability. Here is a size comparison between the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X (bottom) and the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (top). Sam Rutherford for Engadget The bigger grips and a familiar button layout will instantly make longtime Xbox fans feel right at home. And thanks to the new chip and more processes and services that run in the background while you’re gaming, you get class-leading performance and battery life. Aside from lackluster haptics, the ROG Xbox Ally X’s biggest issue is its price. I totally get that there’s a growing number of gamers who constantly crave better performance from their portable PCs. However, the trade-off for all this is a much bigger hit to your wallet. It wasn’t that long ago when the going rate for a premium handheld was more like $500, which made it easier to afford. After all, those devices weren’t really designed to be your main gaming rig like a laptop or desktop. Ultimately the biggest deciding factor for purchasing the ROG Xbox Ally X may be how much someone is already invested into the Xbox ecosystem. If you’re a fan of other game stores or you don’t have a subscription to Xbox Game Pass or a ton of friends on the platform, you won’t get the full benefit of everything Microsoft has integrated into the handheld’s new software. This goes double for devotees of Valve’s digital store and Linux-based OS that don’t need bleeding edge performance, who can safely stick to much more affordable Steam Decks or the Legion Go S. Alternatively, if you want a versatile portable with a giant OLED screen and detachable controllers, the Legion Go 2 is worth consideration as well. Though at $1,300 for the model with a Z2 Extreme chip, it’s even more expensive than this new handheld Xbox. Still, despite some minor caveats, Microsoft has finally put its spin on portable PC gaming (with an assist from ASUS) and brought some welcome upgrades to the space that have made the ROG Xbox Ally X a top shelf device.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-15T12:43:32", "collected_date": "2025-10-15T18:41:07.907352", "language": "en", "tags": ["technology", "languageen-us", "gadgets", "regionus", "game_consoles", "siteengadget", "headline", "consumer"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 2229, "author": "Sam Rutherford", "raw_content_length": 17148, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 11.145, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Dreamcast", "Xbox", "the Xbox Series S", "Costco", "Microsoft"], "persons": ["Xbox Ally X", "Xbox Xbox", "Sega", "Switch 2"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 12862, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Xbox", "ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X review", "An extra life", "a crossroads", "the PlayStation", "Switch", "popularity", "multiple price hikes", "the Xbox Series S", "their momentum"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Xbox": 3.0, "ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X review": 2.0, "An extra life": 2.0, "a crossroads": 1.0, "the PlayStation": 1.0, "Switch": 1.0, "popularity": 1.0, "multiple price hikes": 1.0, "the Xbox Series S": 1.0, "their momentum": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 6.0439987508333335, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 2.798, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.4404, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.7187, "joy": 0.0031, "surprise": 0.0062, "sadness": 0.0373, "fear": 0.1269, "anger": 0.0512, "disgust": 0.0565}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.0, "reasoning": "The article is a product review that provides detailed analysis of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X, including its design, display, and performance.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_cd747819dfb5", "title": "DS-CIM: Digital Stochastic Computing-In-Memory Featuring Accurate OR-Accumulation via Sample Region Remapping for Edge AI Models", "content": "arXiv:2601.06724v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) offers hardware simplicity but suffers from low throughput, while high-throughput Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) is bottlenecked by costly adder logic for matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). To address this trade-off, this paper introduces a digital stochastic CIM (DS-CIM) architecture that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. We implement signed multiply-accumulation (MAC) in a compact, unsigned OR-based circuit by modifying the data representation. Throughput is enhanced by replicating this low-cost circuit 64 times with only a 1x area increase. Our core strategy, a shared Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) with 2D partitioning, enables single-cycle mutually exclusive activation to eliminate OR-gate collisions. We also resolve the 1s saturation issue via stochastic process analysis and data remapping, significantly improving accuracy and resilience to input sparsity.

{"id": "ai_engadget_c686b21c471a", "title": "Apple will allow third-party app stores and payment processing in Brazil", "content": "Brazilian regulators have reached a settlement with Apple after a yearslong investigation into the company's App Store fee practices as well as its policies against third-party app stores. As first reported by Brazilian tech site tecnoblog, the nation's Administrative Council of Economic Defense (CADE) said it has accepted Apple's proposed agreement that will address claims of anticompetitive practices. The agreement will allow for third-party payment processing methods for in-app purchases and reins in Apple's anti-steering efforts by allowing links to external websites for transactions. The settlement requires that these payment options be shown next to Apple's own. Apple must also allow third-party app stores to be installed on its devices, though the company is allowed to display warnings to users if they are written in a neutral and objective way. A new fee structure has also been agreed to, with Apple applying no fee if users are directed to outside payment methods in a text-only way. The use of a clickable link or button for an external payment option will incur a 15 percent fee. Purchases made within Apple's App Store will still be subject to a 10 percent or 20 percent commission. Developers using Apple’s payment system would also be subject to a 5 percent transaction fee. Additionally a 5 percent \"Core Technology Fee\" would be levied against all app downloads from third-party app stores. This new structure bears similarities to policy and fee changes made after the EU passed its Digital Markets Act, with Apple allowing third-party app stores and external purchases subject to varying fees. Apple will have 105 days to comply under the new agreement and could face fines of up to $27 million for failure to implement the changes. The iPhone maker has been facing mounting pressure from regulators worldwide over its anti-steering practices and was recently handed a $587 million fine by the EU for violating its Digital Markets Act. Apple is appealing the fine. In the US, Apple has been embroiled in a court battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games over commissions on purchases that take place on third-party payment platforms.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-allow-third-party-app-stores-and-payment-processing-in-brazil-135114824.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-allow-third-party-app-stores-and-payment-processing-in-brazil-135114824.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-26T13:51:34", "collected_date": "2025-12-26T16:04:25.952371", "language": "en", "tags": ["Mobile Apps", "headline", "region|US", "gadgets", "technology", "Technology & Electronics", "site|engadget", "consumer", "author_name|Andre Revilla", "language|en-US", "provider_name|Engadget", "Business", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 355, "author": "Andre Revilla", "raw_content_length": 3091, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.775, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "3fba3812b2f5db7a75c8863a6547f874", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The article is pure news reporting on a regulatory settlement in Brazil affecting Apple's App Store policies and fee structures.

{"id": "global_news_el_pais_america_591db4224527", "title": "80.000 barriles de petróleo de Pemex a Cuba: la isla se mete en la pugna entre Estados Unidos y México", "content": "Mientras México pedía en la ONU una solución pacífica a la crisis entre Estados Unidos y Venezuela, dos buques petroleros con bandera de Liberia navegaban cerca de Cuba. Las dos embarcaciones habían salido del puerto de Coatzacoalcos (Estado de Veracruz), específicamente de la terminal de Pajaritos, propiedad de Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), con la misión de entregar barriles de hidrocarburos a la isla para contribuir a palear la crisis energética que el país caribeño padece desde hace meses. El gesto de México pronto ha sido interpretado en Estados Unidos como un espaldarazo al régimen cubano y ha abonado a las ya tensas y complejas relaciones entre Ciudad de México y Washington.\nLa presidenta mexicana, Claudia Sheinbaum, ha defendido el envío de crudo a Cuba argumentando que las razones son humanitarias y que históricamente México ha respaldado a la isla ante el bloqueo económico de Estados Unidos. “Independientemente del partido político, ha habido relación México-Cuba. No es algo nuevo, no es una situación nueva. Y todo se hace en el marco de la ley y también por motivos humanitarios al pueblo de Cuba”, mencionó esta semana la mandataria en una de sus conferencias matutinas. Sheinbaum ha enumerado a los presidentes mexicanos que han hecho aportaciones a la isla en distintos momentos de la historia y las aportaciones que en energéticos se han hecho desde la Administración de Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-1994).\nEl envío de buques de la petrolera estatal mexicana a través del golfo de México hasta la isla son bastante comunes desde hace años. Los montos de los envíos son variables y diversas firmas dedicadas al monitoreo de energéticos señalaron, a mediados de este año, que la cantidad de barriles desde México había disminuido significativamente. El último envío -de 80.000 barriles– fue reportado por el Instituto de Energía de la Universidad de Texas. La información sobre el contenido y el coste concreto de los envíos es una nebulosa que Petróleos Mexicanos no ha aclarado completamente. Sheinbaum se ha comprometido a hacer pública la información en los próximos días. “Todo es legal”, ha añadido. En 2024, Sheinbaum reconoció el envío de 400.000 barriles tras el paso del huracán Rafael por la isla y la petrolera ha informado al supervisor financiero de EE UU, la SEC, sobre sus exportaciones, incluidas las que van a Cuba.\nLa opacidad sobre lo que significa para Pemex –la petrolera más endeudada del mundo– designar una parte de su producción a Cuba, se ha convertido en casa en una carnada para los partidos de oposición. “Mientras 2026 arranca con gasolinazos para los mexicanos, el gobierno de Morena regala gasolina a Cuba. Qué indignante: usan el dinero de las y los mexicanos para financiar a una dictadura que mantiene a su pueblo sometido y con hambre”, ha mencionado la diputada del Partido Acción Nacional (PAN), tras conocerse la existencia del reciente cargamento. El Gobierno mexicano ha trabajado en el último año en el saneamiento de la deuda de la petrolera y ha reconocido que la producción se encuentra alicaída con 1,3 millones de barriles diarios, un descenso que regresa la cifra a niveles de 2018.\nLa oferta de México como intermediario en la crisis entre Venezuela y Estados Unidos ha puesto el foco en el papel del Gobierno mexicano en la región latinoamericana. Washington, después de varios años, ha devuelto la mirada al sur y se encuentra en vigilancia muy cercana del régimen de Nicolás Maduro, a quien ha acusado de estar coludido con el narcotráfico, y ha atacado a algunas pequeñas embarcaciones acusándolas de traficar drogas. El cerco estadounidense a Venezuela ha impactado también en el tránsito de buques petroleros hacia Cuba, que han dado la vuelta hacia territorio venezolano ante la amenaza estadounidense.\nEn Washington, el respaldo que México ha dado a la crisis energética de Cuba con el envío de hidrocarburos en los últimos meses supone un importante desacuerdo entre los socios y vecinos. “Envié un mensaje claro a la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum: la historia está mirando. Basta ya de respaldar dictaduras en Venezuela y Cuba”, mencionó la congresista republicana de Florida, María Elvira Salazar, en una sesión del Congreso estadounidense.\nAlgunos legisladores han apuntado hacia un tema sumamente sensible para México: el tratado de libre comercio (TMEC). En octubre, el congresista Carlos Giménez envió una carta al Departamento de Estado sugiriendo que la cooperación económica de México con Cuba, a través del envío de buques con petróleo, suponían una violación del TMEC y que la revisión del acuerdo, prevista para el 2026, podría ser un buen momento para pedir al Gobierno mexicano el fin de su cooperación energética con La Habana. “Estados Unidos no debe permitir que su socio comercial más cercano financie regímenes criminales”, defendió en la misiva. México y Estados Unidos mantienen diversos frentes abiertos en asuntos como migración, seguridad y comercio. Su papel diplomático también ha expuesto su rol en Latinoamérica y sus desacuerdos con su principal socio comercial.\nTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\nFlechaTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

{"id": "science_arxiv_math_314e521f7e32", "title": "Properly Outer Actions of Tensor Categories on C$^*$", "content": "arXiv:2511.09991v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We discuss proper outerness for finite index endomorphisms and finite index bimodules of simple C$^*$-algebras, extending recent similar results by Izumi concerning the purely infinite setting. Our main result is that proper outerness holds automatically for finite index outer endomorphisms of simple C$^*$-algebras. Consequently, freeness for outer actions of unitary tensor categories on simple C$^*$-algebras is also shown to hold automatically. As applications, we obtain structural results about potentially infinite index irreducible discrete inclusions of C$^*$-algebras, such as C$^*$-irreducibility.", "source": "science_arxiv_math",

Baby FuFu is a portable fan for babies that attaches to strollers.Baby FuFu is modeled on the company's smaller (but otherwise identical-looking) drink-cooling gadget, Nekojita FuFu. \"Baby FuFu grew out of Nekojita FuFu fans' feedback that their children love not only cooling their food with it but also playing with it, pretending to fan their faces and blow-dry their hair,\" Yukai Engineering CEO Shunsuke Aoki said.Baby FuFu, positioned on the stroller handle.Image by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe company says the fan blades are concealed behind a slit plate that blocks even the tiniest fingers from entering. The cat-like fan’s \"hands\" and \"feet\" are designed to latch onto stroller handles. Parents can angle Baby FuFu to aim airflow at the child's face (or anywhere else). It has three airflow settings, adjustable with a single button. It charges via USB-C.Baby FuFuImage by Mat Smith for EngadgetYukai Engineering plans to launch Baby FuFu in mid-2026 for somewhere between $50 and $60.

{"id": "ai_engadget_7cf50f57f201", "title": "The best wireless chargers for 2026", "content": "Imagine never having to fumble with a charging cable again. That's the magic of a wireless charger. Not only does going wireless clear up your space and make charging as simple as setting your phone down, but it‚Äôs also surprisingly versatile. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a sleek charging pad for your nightstand, a stand that keeps your phone propped up on your desk or even a foldable charger for convenient travel, there's a wireless charger designed to fit your lifestyle. Some can even double as a car charger, keeping your phone powered up on the go without the hassle of cables to plug in. With so many convenient options, it's easy to see why more people are ditching their wired chargers and embracing the effortlessness of wireless. These are the best wireless chargers we've tested so far. Table of contents Best wireless chargers for 2026 What to look for in a wireless charger Where and how will you use your charger? Wireless charging performance Quality and box contents Wireless chargers FAQs Best wireless chargers for 2026 What to look for in a wireless charger While it‚Äôs tempting to buy a wireless charging pad optimized for the specific phone you have now, resist that urge. Instead, think about the types of devices (phones included) that you could see yourself using in the near future. If you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll use iPhones for a long time, an Apple MagSafe-compatible magnetic wireless charger will be faster and more convenient. If you use Android phones or think you might switch sides, however, you‚Äôll want a more universal design. If you have other accessories like wireless earbuds or a smartwatch that supports wireless charging, maybe you‚Äôd be better off with a 3-in-1 wireless charger or full wireless charging station. Where and how will you use your charger? Odds are that you have a specific use case in mind for your charger. You may want it by your bedside on your nightstand for a quick charge in the morning, or on your desk for at-a-glance notifications. You might even keep it in your bag for convenient travel charging instead of bulky portable chargers or power banks. Think about where you want to use this accessory and what you want to do with the device(s) it charges while it‚Äôs powering up. For example, a wireless charging pad might be better for bedside use if you just want to be able to drop your phone down at the end of a long day and know it‚Äôll be powered up in the morning. However, a stand will be better if you have an iPhone and want to make use of the Standby feature during the nighttime hours. For a desk wireless charger, a stand lets you more easily glance at phone notifications throughout the day. For traveling, undoubtedly, a puck-style charging pad is best since it will take up much less space in your bag than a stand would. Many power banks also include wireless charging pads built in, so one of those might make even more sense for those who are always on the go. Some foldable chargers are also designed for travel, collapsing flat to take up less space. Wireless charging performance Although wireless charging is usually slower than its wired equivalent, speed and wattage are still important considerations. A fast charger can supply enough power for a long night out in the time it takes to change outfits. Look for options that promise faster charging and support standards like Qi2 certified charging for the best balance of efficiency and compatibility. In general, a 15W charger is more than quick enough for most situations, and you‚Äôll need a MagSafe-compatible charger to extract that level of performance from an iPhone. With that said, even the slower 7.5W and 10W chargers are fast enough for an overnight power-up. If anything, you‚Äôll want to worry more about support for cases. While many models can deliver power through a reasonably thick case (typically 3mm to 5mm), you‚Äôll occasionally run into examples that only work with naked phones. There are some proprietary chargers that smash the 15W barrier if you have the right phone. Apple‚Äôs latest MagSafe charging pad can provide up to 25W of wireless power to compatible iPhones when paired with a 30W or 35W adapter ‚Äî the latter being another component you‚Äôll have to get right to make sure the whole equation works as fast as it possibly can. Quality and box contents Pay attention to what‚Äôs included in the box. Some wireless chargers don‚Äôt include power adapters, and others may even ask you to reuse your phone‚Äôs USB-C charging cable. What may seem to be a bargain may prove expensive if you have to buy extras just to use it properly. As mentioned above, you‚Äôll want to make sure all of the components needed to use the wireless charger can provide the level of power you need ‚Äî you‚Äôre only as strong (or in this case, fast) as your weakest link. Fit and finish is also worth considering. You‚Äôre likely going to use your wireless charger every day, so even small differences in build quality could make the difference between joy and frustration. If your charger doesn‚Äôt use MagSafe-compatible tech, textured surfaces like fabric or rubberized plastic are more likely to keep your phone in place. The base should be grippy or weighty enough that the charger won‚Äôt slide around. Also double check that the wireless charger you‚Äôre considering can support phones outfitted with cases ‚Äî the specifications are usually listed in the charger‚Äôs description or specs. You‚Äôll also want to think about the minor conveniences. Status lights are useful for indicating correct phone placement, but an overly bright light can be distracting. Ideally, the light dims or shuts off after a certain period of time. And while we caution against lips and trays that limit compatibility, you may still want some barriers to prevent your device falling off its perch on the charging station. Wireless chargers FAQs Do wireless chargers work if you have a phone case? Many wireless chargers do work if you leave the case on your phone. Generally, a case up to 3mm thick should be compatible with most wireless chargers. However, you should check the manufacturer‚Äôs guide to ensure a case is supported. How do I know if my phone supports wireless charging? Checking the phone‚Äôs specification should tell you if your phone is compatible with wireless charging. You might see words like ‚ÄúQi wireless charging‚Äù or ‚Äúwireless charging compatible.‚Äù Do cords charge your phone faster? Most often, wired charging will be faster than wireless charging. However, wired charging also depends on what the charging cable‚Äôs speed is and how much power it‚Äôs designed to carry. A quick-charging cable that can transmit up to 120W of power is going to be faster than a wireless charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-29T08:01:04", "collected_date": "2025-12-31T00:02:56.029953", "language": "en", "tags": ["consumer", "provider_name|Engadget", "language|en-US", "Consumer Discretionary", "author_name|Jon Fingas", "technology", "region|US", "headline", "gadgets", "Handheld & Connected Devices", "Telecommunication", "site|engadget", "Technology & Electronics", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 1149, "author": "Jon Fingas,Valentina Palladino", "raw_content_length": 9654, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 5.745, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "rss_original", "content_length_chars": 6900}, "content_hash": "ae572ce80e11b1cf1eafb86695222f48", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 9.0, "reasoning": "This article is a classic 'best X to buy' listicle and shopping guide.

In the zero--mass limit, we show that the minimizer of our stochastic optimal transport is tight if and only if the initial momentum of a particle converges to zero.

{"id": "ai_engadget_cfc96b6626ed", "title": "The Netflix and Warner Bros. deal might be great for shareholders, but not for anyone else", "content": "Netflix's $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. is, in many ways, the last thing a weakened Hollywood needs right now. The industry is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, where theaters were forced to close and audiences became even more comfortable with streaming films at home. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes in 2023, which were driven by legitimate concerns around studio interest in generative AI, delayed production and promotion of many film and TV projects. And the rise of streaming content pushed many media companies towards taking on debt and unwise mergers (see: Warner Bros. Discovery), which led to higher subscription costs, layoffs and production belt-tightening.How can a troubled media company survive today? The answer seems to be further consolidation. Amazon's $8.45 billion MGM takeover in 2022 heralded future deals, like Skydance's $8 billion acquisition of Paramount . But Netflix's WB deal goes even further: It could fundamentally reshape the media industry as we know it, from theatrical movie-going to the existence of physical media.What will the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal include? After next year's already-announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery, Netflix says it plans to acquire all of Warner Bros. remaining assets — including its film and TV studios, HBO Max and HBO — for $82.7 billion. According to Game Developer, representatives also say Warner Bros. Games, which includes Mortal Kombat developers NetherRealm, will also be part of the deal. Will the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal be approved by regulators?Even before the deal was formally announced, it was clear that whoever bought WB would be facing government opposition from every side. Yesterday, Paramount sent WB a letter questioning the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the acquisition bidding process (which also included Comcast as a potential buyer). Afterwards, the New York Post reported that Paramount CEO David Ellison, son of the Trump-boosting Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, met with administration officials to make his case for buying Netflix. As of this morning, the Trump administration views the Netflix/WB deal with \"heavy skepticism,\" an official tells CNBC.On the other side of the aisle, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called the Netflix/WB deal an \"anti-monopoly nightmare.\" She added, \"A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market. It could force you into higher prices, fewer choices over what and how you watch, and may put American workers at risk.\" At this point, it's too early to tell if the Netflix/WB deal will make it past regulators, but it's clear that both companies should prepare for a rocky approval process.What does the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal mean for streaming video? According to data from JustWatch, a combined Netflix and HBO would account for 33 percent of the US streaming video market, putting it ahead of Prime Video's 21 percent share. As for how the two media companies would co-exist, Netflix says it will \"maintain Warner Bros. current businesses,\" which includes HBO Max and HBO, theatrical releases for films and well as movie and TV studio operations. JustWatch streaming video market stats.JustWatch\"We think it’s too early to talk specifics about how we’re going to tailor this offering for consumers,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said in an investor call this morning, when asked if HBO would remain a separate service. \"Needless to say, we think the HBO brand is very powerful, and would constitute part of our plan for consumers. That then gives us a lot of options to figure out how to package things to offer the best options for consumers.\"At the very least, we can expect increased prices across the board for HBO and Netflix. There's also potential for the company to offer combination subscriptions, similar to how Disney juggles Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. What does the Netflix and Warner Bros. deal mean for theaters?In short, a combined Netflix/WB wouldn't be great for theaters. Previous mergers, like Disney and Fox's union, led to fewer theatrical releases, not more. Since its transformation into a streaming-first company, Netflix has also been primarily focused on increasing subscriptions and engagement, with theatrical releases of its original content treated as an afterthought. \"We’ve released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it’s not like we have opposition to theatrical release,\" Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in the investor call (without specifying how short some of those theatrical releases were). \"It’s the longer windows that aren’t consumer friendly. Life cycle that starts in the movie theater, we’ll continue that. Over time, the windows will evolve to be much more consumer friendly, to meet the audience where we are.\"He added: \"All things that are going to theaters through WB will continue to do so. Our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to consumers, and we intend to continue with that.\" In an April interview at the Time100 Summit, Sarandos also famously called the theatrical model \"outdated,\" since most people in the US can't easily walk to a multiplex. Cinema United, a trade group representing over 30,000 movie theater screens in the US, is unsurprisingly against the entire deal. “The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business. The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,” Cinema United President and CEO Michael O’Leary said in a statement. “Cinema United stands ready to support industry changes that lead to increased movie production and give consumers more opportunities to enjoy a day at the local theatre,” he added. “But Netflix’s stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.”What do artists think of the Netflix and WB deal?Writers, directors and producers are already having a tough time getting projects off the ground, so having one less place to pitch isn't going to help. There are also a handful of artists, including former WB darling Christopher Nolan, who have refused to work with Netflix entirely. \"The end goal of these consolidations is to limit choices in entertainment to a select handful of providers, so they can capture our whole attention, and thus our every available dollar,\" C. Robert Cargill, the screenwriter behind Doctor Strange and The Black Phone, said in a statement to Engadget. \"The result will be a gutting of diversity and fresh voices in the industry, sending thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people back to their home towns to start their lives over, as there simply isn't a place for them in Hollywood any more, while homogenizing film and television into the \"content\" word we all grumble about hearing.\"\"WB has made so many daring choices this year, with executives taking big risks that made real cultural and financial impacts at the box office,\" he added. \"And HBO, constant name changes be damned, is still making some of the best television there is, bar none. Will those creative environments survive the merger, or will many of those brilliant execs be sent packing along with the writers, directors, and crews?\" \"In short, it's a very scary and heartbreaking time to be a filmmaker. No shade on Netflix and the people that work there; it's just that less choice in entertainment always makes for fewer winners and more people on the outside looking in.\"What about physical media?Other than noting that Netflix used to be a DVD-by-mail company, there was no mention of physical media on the acquisition's press release or investor call. That’s not too surprising, as physical releases have always been an afterthought for Netflix. A few of its films, like Roma and Frances Ha, are available as discs through the Criterion Collection, and some shows like Stranger Things are also on DVD and Blu-ray. Netflix claims it'll continue to run WB's businesses as usual if the deal goes through, which should include physical media, but those sorts of pre-acquisition promises rarely last for long. WB's home video business isn't entirely its own, either: In 2020, it formed the joint venture Studio Distribution Services with Universal, which also handles physical media distribution for Sony Pictures, PBS and Neon.Given the slowing demand for physical media, it’s likely one of the first things a combined Netflix/WB would eventually drop. But there’s also been a resurgence of premium physical releases from distributors like Arrow Video, so there’s a chance Netflix may want to keep it around for special releases.Steve Dent contributed to this report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-netflix-and-warner-bros-deal-might-be-great-for-shareholders-but-not-for-anyone-else-183000247.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "", "published_date": "2025-12-05T18:34:37", "collected_date": "2025-12-07T16:02:51.823444", "language": "en", "tags": ["site|engadget", "Arts & Entertainment", "consumer", "language|en-US", "Movies", "author_name|Devindra Hardawar", "region|US", "Media", "headline", "provider_name|Engadget", "gadgets", "technology", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 1438, "author": "Devindra Hardawar", "raw_content_length": 15292, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 7.19, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "c92680dbd6b0d856c3e8ee5c0ec775c3", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "This article is pure journalism, reporting on a major corporate acquisition and analyzing its potential impact on the industry, consumers, and regulatory landscape.

Cat-transmitted sporotrichosis, primarily caused by S. brasiliensis in South America and to a lesser extent by S. schenckii in Southeast Asia, is emerging as a significant public health concern, due its outbreak potential. Itraconazole is the first-choice drug for treatment of human and cats, but reduced susceptibility has been reported based on previously proposed epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs). To support resistance surveillance, we aimed to establish CLSI-endorsed ECVs for these clinically relevant Sporothrix species. A total of 3,588 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for seven antifungal agents (amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, isavuconazole, olorofim, and terbinafine) were obtained from 19 international laboratories. Four of seven antifungals met the CLSI M57 guidelines criteria to determine the ECV.

{"id": "global_news_el_pais_73a9cf5e326a", "title": "Cómo funciona el Banco de Alimentos en Mercamadrid, que reparte donaciones de producto fresco y congelado", "content": "“Hoy nos han donado un palé de naranjas y las estamos clasificando, seleccionando las que son aptas para el consumo. Las que no lo son, las depositamos en una tolva, que luego Mercamadrid lleva al ecoárea [la zona destinada a la separación y reciclaje de los residuos] para producir compost”. Así relata Luis Mohedano, responsable de la delegación de la Fundación Banco de Alimentos en el mayor mercado europeo de alimentación fresca, una parte de su labor diaria. Un equipo de 32 voluntarios y tres empleados se organizan en diferentes turnos para recibir, clasificar y repartir a entidades benéficas de toda la Comunidad de Madrid los alimentos donados por los mayoristas. Estos productos se utilizarán para preparar menús solidarios o bolsas de comida que se entregarán a personas en situación de pobreza o exclusión social. “A lo largo del año repartimos del orden del millón de kilos de fruta, verdura y otros productos”, afirma.\nLo que hace especial a esta delegación es que recoge producto fresco y congelado. Cuando se trata de donar alimentos, a menudo pensamos solo en las legumbres en conserva, el aceite, la pasta o el arroz, que ofrecen un margen de tiempo más amplio desde que se entregan hasta que se reparten. Las frutas y las hortalizas, sin embargo, tienen una fecha de consumo más limitada, lo que exige que los voluntarios del Banco de Alimentos trabajen rápido. “Tratamos de repartirlas inmediatamente o, como mucho, un día o dos después de haberlas recibido y seleccionado”, explica Mohedano.\nLa labor del Banco de Alimentos es proporcionar comida a aquellas personas con menos recursos, pero también contribuir a aliviar el desperdicio alimentario, en este caso, dentro de Mercamadrid. La fundación lleva 14 años instalada en el mercado mayorista, en un espacio cedido en la calle 48. Cuentan con varias naves, donde se ubican las cámaras de conservación de fruta y verdura, la de congelados, una zona de clasificación y separación, y sus oficinas. Este verano, Mercamadrid publicó una guía práctica destinada a las empresas que operan en sus instalaciones para “facilitar su adaptación” a la Ley de Prevención de las Pérdidas y el Desperdicio Alimentario, aprobada en el mes de marzo.\nEn total, el Banco de Alimentos cuenta con cuatro delegaciones en la Comunidad de Madrid: la del Colegio San Fernando, en Fuencarral-El Pardo, donde están sus oficinas principales; dos almacenes en Alcalá de Henares y Alcorcón; y la de Mercamadrid, que aunque es la más pequeña, realiza una labor crítica para garantizar que estos alimentos esenciales se puedan emplear en la elaboración de menús nutritivos y equilibrados. Cuando el producto que reciben está en perfectas condiciones —aquellos alimentos que no se han podido vender por calibre, porque su periodo de consumo está próximo a vencer o porque el precio de mercado del producto no cubre sus costes—, se reparte tal y como viene. Cuando no es así, clasifican todo aquel que sigue siendo apto para el consumo humano y, el resto, se desecha.\nEsta selección es la que más manos requiere y los voluntarios se emplean con afán en separar los alimentos aptos de los que no lo son. Una vez hecha la clasificación, los productos se van apilando fuera, a un lado los frescos y a otro los productos elaborados —como por ejemplo, la mantequilla o el maíz envasado al vacío—, donde acuden las furgonetas a recogerlos. “Es como una donación mayorista, así que son las entidades benéficas las que vienen a recoger los productos y luego son ellas las que se encargan de distribuirlos”, cuenta Luis Mohedano.\nLas entidades que acuden al Banco de Alimentos de Mercamadrid deben contar con cámaras frigoríficas que permitan almacenar correctamente el producto fresco que recogen. Además, Luis explica que “hay una figura de voluntarios, que se llaman visitadores, que son el vínculo entre el propio banco y las entidades benéficas. Se encargan de visitar sus instalaciones para asegurarse de que cumplen todos los requisitos”. El propio banco colabora con ellas en campañas de donación de arcones de congelados para que puedan recibir este tipo de productos y almacenarlos en condiciones. También hay empresas y fundaciones que no solo contribuyen donando alimentos, sino también servicios de transporte, maquinaria, mobiliario o, incluso, patrocinando una “calle”, con su placa incluida, en las diferentes sedes del Banco de Alimentos.\nY aunque podría parecer que la Navidad es la época más ajetreada para el Banco de Alimentos, después de la célebre Gran Recogida que organizan cada noviembre para abastecer sus almacenes y así poder proporcionar alimentos durante todo el año, lo cierto es que, en esta delegación, reciben la misma cantidad de donaciones en estas fechas que el resto del año. “Aquí, en Mercamadrid, —aclara Luis— la época de más trabajo suele ser el verano, porque es cuando la campaña de frutas está más fuerte y, al ser producto perecedero, con las altas temperaturas, su período de vida útil es menor. Tenemos que ser más rápidos y coincide con que, además, tenemos menos voluntarios por las vacaciones”.\nDesde las cuatro delegaciones del Banco de Alimentos en Madrid, distribuyen a toda la comunidad. A nivel nacional, cada provincia tiene sus bancos de alimentos propios y todos forman parte de la Federación Española de Bancos de Alimentos, que es la que les representa ante la Federación Europea de Bancos de Alimentos. Gracias a este funcionamiento en red, explica Luis Mohedano, se pudo atender, por ejemplo, la necesidad alimentaria provocada por la guerra de Rusia en Ucrania, con el apoyo de los bancos de alimentos más próximos a la frontera del país, como son los de Polonia, Rumanía o Bulgaria.\nTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo\n¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?\nSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.\nFlechaTu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.\nSi quieres compartir tu cuenta, cambia tu suscripción a la modalidad Premium, así podrás añadir otro usuario.

{"id": "science_arxiv_math_ddff40d62f88", "title": "Path Integral Derivations Of K", "content": "arXiv:2509.23042v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We consider 5d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory on $X\\times S^1$, with $X$ a closed smooth four-manifold. A partial topological twisting along $X$ renders the theory formally independent of the metric on $X$. The theory depends on the spin structure and the circumference $R$ of $S^1$. The coefficients of the $R$-expansion of the partition function are Witten indices, which are identified with $L^2$-indices of Dirac operators on moduli spaces of instantons. The partition function encodes BPS indices for instanton particles on a spatial manifold $X$, and these indices are special cases of K-theoretic Donaldson invariants. When the 't Hooft flux of the gauge theory is nonzero and $X$ is not spin, the 5d theory can be anomalous, but this anomaly can be canceled by coupling to a line bundle with connection for the global $U(1)$ ``instanton number symmetry''. For $b_2^+(X)>0$ we can derive the partition function from integration over the Coulomb branch of the effective 4d low-energy theory. When $X$ is toric we can also use equivariant localization with respect to the $\\mathbb{C}^* \\times \\mathbb{C}^*$ symmetry. The two methods lead to the same results for the wall-crossing formula. We also determine path integrals for four-manifolds with $b_2^+(X)>1$. Our results agree with those for algebraic surfaces by G\\\"ottsche, Kool, Nakajima, Yoshioka, and Williams, but apply to a larger class of manifolds.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_2ef8fb224bd7", "title": "Monoid Structures on Indexed Containers", "content": "arXiv:2509.25879v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets. We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad.

When he took power in September, he said he would dissolve parliament by the end of January.\nHowever, now facing an imminent vote of no confidence, Anutin brought the election forward.\nAnutin and his Bhumjaithai party were heavily criticised for their handling of serious flooding in southern Thailand last month, which left at least 176 people dead.\nThe house's dissolution comes during renewed fighting with Cambodia, which has killed at least 20 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.\n\"The government had executed every means in public administration to quickly resolve the urgent issues overwhelming the country… but running the country requires stability,\" Anutin wrote in the decree endorsed by Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn.\n\"As a minority government, together with troubling domestic political circumstances, it has been unable to carry out public administration continuously, effectively and with stability,\" he wrote.\nThe dissolution order comes after the prime minister lost the support of the youthful, progressive People's Party - also the largest party in parliament - which had previously backed his premiership.\nThe People's Party and the pragmatic, conservative Bhumjaithai are ideological opposites.\nThe opposition bloc's support, however, came with strings attached. It wanted Anutin to start reforms of Thailand's military-drafted constitution and to dissolve the house within four months, among other things.\nThe People's Party has now accused Bhumjaithai of failing to honour that deal. It had planned to submit a no-confidence motion against the government on Friday, according to Thai media - having already called on the prime minister on Thursday to disband parliament to \"show responsibility towards the people\".\n\"See you at the polling stations,\" the party said in statement on Facebook.\nThailand has been in political turmoil over the past year, with two prime ministers dismissed by the courts.\nAnutin's predecessor Paetongtarn Shinawatra was removed for violating ethics, after she was heard calling Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen \"uncle\" and criticising the Thai army in a leaked phone call.\nSrettha Thavisin, the leader before her, was also dismissed for violating ethics, by appointing to his cabinet a former lawyer who was once jailed.\nAdditional reporting by Jonathan Head in Bangkok", "source": "global_news_BBC_world", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v11rd200yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-12T02:06:39", "collected_date": "2025-12-12T16:05:10.245366", "language": "en", "tags": ["current_events", "news", "international", "politics", "global", "global_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "BBC News", "source_category": "global_news", "word_count": 15, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 102, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 2, "reading_time_minutes": 0.075, "robust_parsing_used": true, "content_source": "fetched", "original_content_length": 102, "fetched_content_length": 2969, "content_improvement_ratio": 29.11}, "content_hash": "fbaf7d373b428de040c2aab5d1d06013", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The article is a pure news report detailing a significant political event in Thailand – the dissolution of parliament.

The smart alarm clock remains the smallest Echo device with a display, but it's one that's really best just for showing the time, weather and other quick bits of information. You can grab one now for only $45 thanks to Prime Day deals; that's 44 percent off its usual price. The latest incarnation of the diminutive Spot was introduced in July 2024, and this matches its record-low price. For that you get a comfortably bedside-sized device with a sharper display than its predecessor, as well as superior sound. The front face is divided into two halves, with a speaker positioned below the hemispherical display. What screen you do have is more than enough to display the time and weather information, plus it can show you the song or album title and accompanying artwork when you’re listening to music on those improved speakers. It can naturally be used to boss around your other connected smart devices, too. Alexa might be baked in, but the Echo Spot is intended to be a fairly bare-bones smart alarm clock, so don’t expect as many features as you’ll find on something like the Echo Show 5. But a lot of people just want a modern alarm clock, and arguably the biggest selling point for the Echo Spot is its total lack of a camera. While that means it can do less than the original 2017 Echo Spot, which Amazon did put a camera in, the decision to remove it from a device that lives right next to your bed was probably for the best. Amazon’s Prime Day sale returns on October 7, so you can expect a range of deals on its various Echo devices.

Existing approaches come with restrictions -- they require access to template-based shape priors or artist-designed deformation rigs, suffer from limited generalization to unseen motion and/or shapes, or exhibit motion jitter. We propose Self-supervised Motion Fields (SMF), a self-supervised framework that is trained with only sparse motion representations, without requiring dataset-specific annotations, templates, or rigs. At the heart of our method are Kinetic Codes, a novel autoencoder-based sparse motion encoding, that exposes a semantically rich latent space, simplifying large-scale training. Our architecture comprises dedicated spatial and temporal gradient predictors, which are jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. The combined network, regularized by the Kinetic Codes' latent space, has good generalization across both unseen shapes and new motions. We evaluated our method on unseen motion sampled from AMASS, D4D, Mixamo, and raw monocular video for animation transfer on various characters with varying shapes and topology. We report a new SoTA on the AMASS dataset in the context of generalization to unseen motion.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_1f7f860e2c09", "title": "Federated Causal Inference from Multi", "content": "arXiv:2505.17961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Causal inference typically assumes centralized access to individual-level data. Yet, in practice, data are often decentralized across multiple sites, making centralization infeasible due to privacy, logistical, or legal constraints. We address this problem by estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from decentralized observational data via a Federated Learning (FL) approach, allowing inference through the exchange of aggregate statistics rather than individual-level data. We propose a novel method to estimate propensity scores by computing a federated weighted average of local scores with Membership Weights (MW)--probabilities of site membership conditional on covariates--which can be flexibly estimated using parametric or non-parametric classification models. Unlike density ratio weights (DW) from the transportability and generalization literature, which either rely on strong modeling assumptions or cannot be implemented in FL, MW can be estimated using standard FL algorithms and are more robust, as they support flexible, non-parametric models--making them the preferred choice in multi-site settings with strict data-sharing constraints. The resulting propensity scores are used to construct Federated Inverse Propensity Weighting (Fed-IPW) and Augmented IPW (Fed-AIPW) estimators. Unlike meta-analysis methods, which fail when any site violates positivity, our approach leverages heterogeneity in treatment assignment across sites to improve overlap. We show that Fed-IPW and Fed-AIPW perform well under site-level heterogeneity in sample sizes, treatment mechanisms, and covariate distributions. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on simulated and real-world data highlight their advantages over meta-analysis and related methods.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17961", "published_date": "2025-10-02T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-02T06:38:44.689494", "language": "en", "tags": ["mathst", "computer-science", "research", "statap", "statth", "csai", "preprints", "statme", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 235, "author": "Khellaf R\\'emi, Bellet Aur\\'elien, Josse Julie", "raw_content_length": 1822, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.175, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["the Average Treatment Effect (ATE", "Multi arXiv:2505.17961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross", "Federated Causal Inference", "Membership Weights ("], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1821, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Federated Causal Inference", "Multi", "replace-cross Abstract", "Causal inference", "centralized access", "individual-level data", "practice", "data", "multiple sites", "centralization"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["data"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Federated Causal Inference": 2.0, "Multi": 2.0, "replace-cross Abstract": 1.0, "Causal inference": 1.0, "centralized access": 1.0, "individual-level data": 1.0, "practice": 1.0, "data": 1.0, "multiple sites": 1.0, "centralization": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.8159397883333335, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 3.0655, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.3869, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is a scientific abstract from arXiv, detailing a novel research method in federated causal inference.

The cars, alongside other Porsche models, are gaining support for Samsung Wallet's Digital Key feature, which lets users wirelessly control their car over a secure UWB or NFC connection.Digital Key support will be available in Europe in December, before rolling out globally, \"aligned with the launch timeline of Porsche vehicles,\" Samsung says. Samsung Wallet is available on Samsung devices as old as the Galaxy S20, Note 20, Galaxy Z Fold 2 and Galaxy Flip 5G, and is included on the majority of the company's new phones. Like similar features on Google's Pixels and Apple's iPhones, Digital Key allows Porsche owners with a supported Galaxy phone to unlock, lock and start their car directly from their phone. If your phone is ever taken, you can also remotely lock or delete a Digital Key to keep your car safe.Samsung added Digital Key support to select Volvo and Polestar EVs in February 2025. The feature first became available in 2021, and is one of several ways the phone maker imagines people will use Samsung Wallet. Beyond digital car keys, the app can also store credit and debit cards and be used to transfer money with a tap.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-wallet-to-gain-support-for-digital-porsche-keys-193000085.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-wallet-to-gain-support-for-digital-porsche-keys-193000085.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-09T19:30:58", "collected_date": "2025-12-10T00:04:50.322618", "language": "en", "tags": ["author_name|Ian Carlos Campbell", "Technology & Electronics", "headline", "gadgets", "provider_name|Engadget", "Handheld & Connected Devices", "region|US", "Smart Phones", "technology", "consumer", "language|en-US", "site|engadget", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 227, "author": "Ian Carlos Campbell", "raw_content_length": 2492, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.135, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "0fc3c6c8c5edddb8c458998e45cf0c16", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "This article reports on a new feature for Samsung Wallet, specifically its integration with Porsche digital car keys.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_0260d6360d30", "title": "Climate Driven Interactions Between Malaria Transmission and Diabetes Prevalence", "content": "arXiv:2511.08562v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Climate change is intensifying infectious and chronic diseases like malaria and diabetes, respectively, especially among the vulnerable populations. Global temperatures have risen by approximately $0.6^\\circ$C since 1950, extending the window of transmission for mosquito-borne infections and worsening outcomes in diabetes due to metabolic stress caused by heat. People living with diabetes have already weakened immune defenses and, therefore, are at an alarmingly increased risk of contraction of malaria. However, most models rarely include both ways of interaction in changing climate conditions. In the paper, we introduce a new compartmental epidemiological model based on synthetic data fitted to disease patterns of India from 2019 to 2021. The framework captures temperature-dependent transmission parameters, seasonal variability, and different disease dynamics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups within the three-compartment system. Model calibration using Multi-Start optimization combined with Sequential Quadratic Programming allows us to find outstanding differences between populations. The odds of malaria infection in diabetic individuals were found to be 1.8--4.0 times higher, with peak infection levels in 35--36\\%, as compared to 20--21\\% in the non-diabetic ones. The fitted model was able to capture well the epidemiological patterns observed, while the basic reproduction number averaged around 2.3, ranging from 0.31 to 2.75 in different seasons. Given that India's diabetic population is set to rise to about 157 million people by 2050, these findings point to a pressing need for concerted efforts toward climate-informed health strategies and monitoring systems that address both malaria and diabetes jointly.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08562", "published_date": "2025-12-16T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-12-17T04:04:32.572296", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "cs.MA", "computer-science", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 246, "author": "Shivank, Anurag Singh, Fakhteh Ghanbarnejad, Ajay K Sharma", "raw_content_length": 1798, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.23, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "b269e7e4eae074d0d7dcb48fe230ad73", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract for a scientific research paper, detailing a new epidemiological model and its findings regarding the interaction between malaria and diabetes under climate change.

Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K.

However, recent visuomotor policies often focus solely on learning position or force control, overlooking their co-learning. In this work, we propose the first unified policy for legged robots that jointly models force and position control learned without reliance on force sensors. By simulating diverse combinations of position and force commands alongside external disturbance forces, we use reinforcement learning to learn a policy that estimates forces from historical robot states and compensates for them through position and velocity adjustments. This policy enables a wide range of manipulation behaviors under varying force and position inputs, including position tracking, force application, force tracking, and compliant interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned policy enhances trajectory-based imitation learning pipelines by incorporating essential contact information through its force estimation module, achieving approximately 39.5% higher success rates across four challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks compared to position-control policies. Extensive experiments on both a quadrupedal manipulator and a humanoid robot validate the versatility and robustness of the proposed policy across diverse scenarios.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20829", "published_date": "2025-10-07T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-07T06:39:29.225639", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "research", "csro", "computer-science", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 189, "author": "Peiyuan Zhi, Peiyang Li, Jianqin Yin, Baoxiong Jia, Siyuan Huang", "raw_content_length": 1462, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.945, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1461, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["a Unified Policy", "Position and Force Control", "Legged Loco", "arXiv250520829v2 Announce Type", "Abstract", "Robotic loco-manipulation tasks", "contact-rich interactions", "the environment", "the joint modeling", "contact force"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"a Unified Policy": 2.0, "Position and Force Control": 2.0, "Legged Loco": 2.0, "arXiv250520829v2 Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Robotic loco-manipulation tasks": 1.0, "contact-rich interactions": 1.0, "the environment": 1.0, "the joint modeling": 1.0, "contact force": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7546074772222227, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 8.1845, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.6369, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.93, "joy": 0.0102, "surprise": 0.0267, "sadness": 0.005, "fear": 0.0062, "anger": 0.0146, "disgust": 0.0074}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract for a scientific research paper published on arXiv.

{"id": "ai_engadget_d65e7fde1bfe", "title": "Get 75 percent off Proton VPN two", "content": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed ‚Äî Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android ‚Äî and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

{"id": "ai_engadget_8a1b4ca0c1f3", "title": "Apple's Cyber Monday sale includes the MacBook Air M4 for $250 off", "content": "Cyber Monday is here with a special gift: 25 percent off Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4. The 13-inch model is down to $749, from $999 — as low as we've seen it. The MacBook Air M4 garnered a 92 in our review thanks to features like its sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

An open question is whether their predictions are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this direction.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00628", "published_date": "2025-10-02T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-02T06:38:44.379370", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "cscl", "preprints", "computer-science", "cssd", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 151, "author": "Yu-Xiang Lin, Chen-An Li, Sheng-Lun Wei, Po-Chun Chen, Hsin-Hsi Chen, Hung-yi Lee", "raw_content_length": 995, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.755, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 994, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["the Order", "Selection Bias", "Large Audio", "LALMs", "arXiv251000628v1 Announce Type", "new Abstract", "Large audio-language models", "tasks", "reasoning", "ordered options"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"the Order": 2.0, "Selection Bias": 2.0, "Large Audio": 2.0, "LALMs": 2.0, "arXiv251000628v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "Large audio-language models": 1.0, "tasks": 1.0, "reasoning": 1.0, "ordered options": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.804725533888889, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 1.2014999999999998, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.7597, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "This content is a scientific research paper, clearly falling under 'Journalism/Editorial Content' as per the definition.

This is made all the more true when they're on sale. Take the Bose QuietComfort Headphones, which are down to $170 from $359. The 53 percent discount brings these headphones to a new record-low price — even better than their Black Friday deal. Bose released its new QuietComfort Headphones in October and they're an incredible option, especially for the sale price. It offers ANC with two modes: Quiet and Aware. It also has up to 24 hours of battery life and should give you two and a half hours of juice after just 15 minutes of charging. Looking for something a bit more high-tech? The second-generation Bose QuietComfort Ultra Bluetooth Headphones have also been on sale for some time now. An 11 percent discount brings them down to $399, from $449 — an all-time low price since they came out in September. We gave the second-gen Quiet Comfort Ultras a 90 in our review, thanks to incredible active noise cancelation and upgraded sound quality. They also overtook Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones (also great and 12 percent off) for the top spot in our best noise-canceling headphones for 2025 list.

{"id": "ai_engadget_365c981f4637", "title": "CloverPit, a Balatro", "content": "CloverPit is one of my favorite games of the year so far. Developer Panik Arcade took the formula that helped make Balatro so successful — using various tools to bend the rules of the game to help you rack up obscenely high scores — and based it around a slot machine rather than poker. It’s been a hit so far on PC, where it has sold more than a million copies since September, and on Xbox. CloverPit has been among the top 20 most-played titles on Game Pass since its surprise debut there last month. Now, the horror-tinged roguelite is venturing into new territory, as it’s coming to iOS and Android on December 17.The mobile versions of the game are said to have a fully-optimized interface, as well as all of the post-launch updates, such as the Hard Mode that Panik Arcade recently added. CloverPit will cost $5 on mobile and it will have no microtransactions or “predatory mechanics.” That might seem surprising for a game centered around a slot machine, but CloverPit isn’t really about gambling (which the developers say they don’t like anyway). It’s about breaking the rules to tilt the odds in your favor.The setup is pretty straightforward. You’re imprisoned in a rusty cell and you have a rapidly increasing debt to pay off. The only way to do that, and hopefully leave through the door, is to earn enough coins from the slot machine to pay what you owe. There are more than 150 items (which are called charms here) to experiment with that affect things like the number of spins, how much each symbol or pattern is worth and how many tickets you earn. Tickets are what you need to buy more charms.Figuring out combinations of items that work well together is key to quickly scaling up the number of coins and tickets you can earn from each visit to the slot machine. Fail to pay off your debt by a deadline (i.e. after a certain number of spins) and it’s game over, as you plunge into the titular pit. CloverPit is strange and beguiling and heaps of fun. I’ve plowed around 39 hours into it on Steam, and I’m sure it’ll take up much of my attention on my phone after it hits mobile next week. Doomspinning seems slightly healthier for my brain than doomscrolling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cloverpit-a-balatro-style-game-with-a-grungy-slot-machine-hits-ios-and-android-on-december-17-154500028.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cloverpit-a-balatro-style-game-with-a-grungy-slot-machine-hits-ios-and-android-on-december-17-154500028.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-10T15:45:25", "collected_date": "2025-12-11T20:05:19.301407", "language": "en", "tags": ["technology", "consumer", "region|US", "language|en-US", "headline", "site|engadget", "Video Games", "gadgets", "author_name|Kris Holt", "provider_name|Engadget", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 398, "author": "Kris Holt", "raw_content_length": 4419, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.99, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "7aa514cdf7041e7c59c1e0aff295e13c", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.5, "reasoning": "The article is a positive review of the game CloverPit, but its primary focus is announcing the game's upcoming release on iOS and Android, explicitly stating the mobile price ($5) and release date (December 17).

However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile, we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively. Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of the model.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs",

{"id": "ai_engadget_803be66f180a", "title": "Our favorite budgeting app has 50 percent off subscriptions right now for Black Friday", "content": "Now's the time of year you might be reconsidering how you budget your finances, or establishing a plan if you don't have one already. While it's possible to do it all yourself, budgeting apps can automate some processes and make it easier to see where your money is going and patterns, both good and bad, that might be occurring. For Black Friday, you can get 50 percent off our favorite budgeting app, Quicken Simplifi. The Quicken Simplifi app is down to $3 monthly from $6 monthly, adding up to $36 for the year. Quicken Classic, the company's \"original desktop software\" for \"experienced investors\" is also half off at $6 monthly, down from $12 monthly. The sale starts today and is available until Wednesday, December 3. One of the many things that sets Quicken Simplifi apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account. It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn't offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it's not for you.

Apple Music is holding one heck of a sale right now. You can get three months of use for just $1. There are some caveats, as this is only for new users on the individual plan. Students and family plans don't count for this. Also, this has to be redeemed on iPhone, iPad or Mac. When you click the link it'll open up the Apple Music app, so click it from an Apple product to get the deal. Finally, it auto-renews after 90 days at $11 per month. Make sure to cancel ahead of time if you aren't enjoying the service. As for Apple Music, it's one of the best music streaming platforms out there and certainly a perfect choice for those already tied to the Apple ecosystem. It lets you import your own files, which is great for anyone still hanging on to an iTunes library. Otherwise, it offers streaming access to millions upon millions songs like all the rest. It does, however, include some live radio stations staffed by actual people, which is cool. The app works with Android devices, but it's really designed for Apple products. We also found the spatial audio to sound unnatural at times, but that's partly a limitation of the tech.

In order to align compression models to human perception, prior work has employed differentiable perceptual losses consisting of neural networks calibrated on large-scale datasets of human psycho-visual judgments. We show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can replicate binary human two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) judgments zero-shot when asked to reason about the differences between pairs of images. Motivated to exploit the powerful zero-shot visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we propose Vision-Language Models for Image Compression (VLIC), a diffusion-based image compression system designed to be post-trained with binary VLM judgments. VLIC leverages existing techniques for diffusion model post-training with preferences, rather than distilling the VLM judgments into a separate perceptual loss network. We show that calibrating this system on VLM judgments produces competitive or state-of-the-art performance on human-aligned visual compression depending on the dataset, according to perceptual metrics and large-scale user studies. We additionally conduct an extensive analysis of the VLM-based reward design and training procedure and share important insights.

This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20679", "published_date": "2025-12-25T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-12-26T04:04:32.894616", "language": "en", "tags": ["cs.HC", "preprints", "cs.SI", "computer-science", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 199, "author": "Kijung Lee", "raw_content_length": 1558, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.995, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "b0a632a7a3d9af8f27ff9ff3de8d76bd", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "This content is an abstract for a scientific research paper.

{"id": "global_news_spiegel_42cb08eba032", "title": "Ägypten: Archäologen finden 2000 Jahre altes Partyboot vor der Küste Alexandrias", "content": "Dieser Artikel gehört zum Angebot von SPIEGEL+. Sie können ihn auch ohne Abonnement lesen, weil er Ihnen geschenkt wurde.\nDer Leuchtturm von Alexandria zählt zu den sieben Weltwundern der Antike. Mehr Spaß als dort haben die Menschen rund um die Insel Pharos aber wahrscheinlich auf Vergnügungsbooten gehabt. Nun haben Forscher des Europäischen Instituts für Unterwasserarchäologie (IEASM) offenbar ein solches Gefährt vor der Küste Alexandrias entdeckt. Zuvor hatte unter anderem der »Guardian« berichtet.\nDas 35 Meter lange Boot wurde vor der versunkenen Insel Antirhodos gefunden, die Teil des großen Hafens von Alexandria war. Es stammt laut den Forschern aus der ersten Hälfte des ersten Jahrhunderts. Nach den Beschreibungen des griechischen Historikers Strabon aus dem ersten Jahrhundert waren diese Schiffe »luxuriös ausgestattet und werden vom Königshof für Ausflüge genutzt; und von den Feiernden, die von Alexandria aus den Kanal hinunter zu den öffentlichen Festen fahren; denn Tag und Nacht sind die Boote voller Menschen, die Flöte spielen und ohne Hemmungen und mit äußerster Zügellosigkeit tanzen.«\nEine andere Theorie besagt, dass das Boot eine heilige Barke gewesen sein könnte, die zu einem Tempel für die ägyptische Göttin Isis gehörte. Es könnte laut Goddio Teil einer »Seezeremonie zu Ehren der Göttin« gewesen sein.\nObwohl die Erforschung des Wracks noch in den Anfängen steckt, verspricht sie neue Einblicke in »Leben, Religion, Luxus und Vergnügen auf den Wasserstraßen des frühen römischen Ägyptens«, sagte Goddio. Auf dem Boot wurden Graffitis in griechischer Sprache gefunden, die noch nicht entschlüsselt worden sind.\nRömisches Mosaik um 100 vor Christus, das den Nil zeigen soll\nFoto: 140_1705991 / GRANGER Historical Picture Archive / IMAGOGoddio vermutet, dass das Boot im Zuge einer Reihe von Erdbeben und Flutwellen versunken sein könnte, denen auch der Große Hafen und Paläste Alexandrias zu Opfer fielen.\nDas Wrack wird allerdings nicht vom Meeresgrund geborgen.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_4d01f373a854", "title": "Machine Learning", "content": "arXiv:2510.23908v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane, divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors, including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy. The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS assisted 6G networks.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908", "published_date": "2025-10-29T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-29T06:41:13.533796", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "cset", "preprints", "computer-science", "eesssp", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 241, "author": "M.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_fa5c114846d7", "title": "Intelligence per Watt: Measuring Intelligence Efficiency of Local AI", "content": "arXiv:2511.07885v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (<=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization.

Badiale and I. Cravero, under submission), providing full details of the computations developed in Section 4.2. The purpose of this supplement is to derive explicitly the first Lyapunov coefficient associated with a Hopf bifurcation, following the framework of Yu. A. Kuznetsov (Elements of Applied Bifurcation Theory, Springer, 4th ed., 2023). We compute the multilinear forms $B$ and $C$, the right and left eigenvectors and their normalization, and the resolvents $A^{-1}$ and $(2i\\omega_0 I - A)^{-1}$.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_afc3e508d838", "title": "Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium", "content": "arXiv:2509.26234v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234", "published_date": "2025-10-13T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T06:41:04.932711", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "preprints", "eesssy", "cssy", "cslg", "computer-science", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 220, "author": "Ayush Patnaik, Jackson Fogelquist, Adam B Zufall, Stephen K Robinson, Xinfan Lin", "raw_content_length": 1651, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.1, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1650, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Lithium", "Machine Learning Detection", "Lithium Plating", "arXiv250926234v3 Announce Type", "Abstract", "fast charging", "a critical degradation mechanism", "capacity fade", "catastrophic safety failures", "Recent work"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Machine Learning Detection"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Lithium": 3.0, "Machine Learning Detection": 2.0, "Lithium Plating": 2.0, "arXiv250926234v3 Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "fast charging": 1.0, "a critical degradation mechanism": 1.0, "capacity fade": 1.0, "catastrophic safety failures": 1.0, "Recent work": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7737945655555554, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 0.7045000000000001, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.8591, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.4167, "joy": 0.0033, "surprise": 0.0207, "sadness": 0.0204, "fear": 0.4174, "anger": 0.0686, "disgust": 0.0529}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "This content is a scientific abstract from arXiv, detailing a machine learning method for detecting lithium plating in batteries.

To address these challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying, malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign queries.

{"id": "ai_engadget_a45b0549f75b", "title": "The best SSDs in 2026", "content": "Upgrading to a good SSD can make your computer feel brand new again. Apps open faster, files move in a blink and even older machines start to feel a lot more responsive. It is one of the easiest ways to breathe life into a laptop or desktop without replacing the whole system, and the performance boost is something you notice right away.There are plenty of SSDs to choose from, though, and the naming alone can be confusing if you are not already familiar with the specs. Some drives are built for simple upgrades, while others offer speeds that benefit creators or gamers. To help you sort through it, we tested a wide mix of options and pulled together the best SSDs you can buy right now. Table of contents Best SSDs in 2026 How we test SSDs What to look for in a PC SSD What to look for in portable and USB flash drives A note on console storage SSD FAQs Best SSDs in 2026 How we test SSDs I’ve either tested or personally use daily every storage drive recommended on this list. Out of our top picks, I bought four with my own money after doing about a dozen hours of research. Separately, Engadget Senior Reporter Jeff Dunn has also tested a handful of our recommendations, including the Crucial X9 Pro listed above. What to look for in a PC SSD The most affordable way to add fast storage space to a computer is with a 2.5-inch SATA drive. It’s also one of the easiest if you don’t want to worry about compatibility since almost every computer made in the last two decades will include a motherboard with Serial ATA connections. For that reason, the best SATA SSDs are an excellent choice if you want to extend the life of an older PC build. Installation is straightforward, too. Once you’ve secured the internal SSD in a drive cage, all you need to do is to connect it to your motherboard and power supply. The one downside of SATA drives is that, in terms of responsiveness, they’re slower than their high-performance NVMe counterparts, with SATA III limiting data transfers to 600MB/s. But even the slowest SSD will be significantly faster than the best mechanical drives. And with high-capacity, 1TB SATA SSDs costing about $100, they’re a good bulk-storage option. If your PC is newer, there’s a good chance it includes space for one or more M.2 SSDs. The form factor represents your ticket to the fastest SSDs on the market, but the tricky part is navigating all the different standards and specs involved. M.2 drives can feature either a SATA or PCIe connection. SSDs with the latter are known as Non-Volatile Memory or NVMe drives and are significantly faster than their SATA counterparts, with Gen3 models offering sequential write speeds of up to 3,000MB/s. These drives rely on NVMe NAND technology for their superior performance and durability. You can get twice the performance with a Gen4 SSD, but you’ll need a motherboard and processor that supports the standard. If you’re running an AMD system, that means at least a Ryzen 3000 or 5000 CPU and an X570 or B550 motherboard. With Intel, meanwhile, you’ll need at least an 11th or 12th Gen processor and a Z490, Z590 or Z690 motherboard. Keep in mind that Gen4 SSDs typically cost more than their Gen3 counterparts as well. More expensive still are the latest Gen5 models, which offer sequential read speeds of up to 16,000MB/s. However, even if your computer supports the standard, you’re better off buying a more affordable Gen4 or Gen3 drive. At the moment, very few games and applications can take advantage of Gen3 NVMe speeds, let alone Gen4 and Gen5 speeds. What’s more, Gen5 NVMe drives can run hot, which can lead to performance and longevity issues. Your money is better spent on other components, like upgrading your GPU, for now. As for why you would buy an M.2 SATA drive over a similarly specced 2.5-inch drive, it comes down to ease of installation. You add M.2 storage to your computer by installing the SSD directly onto the motherboard. That may sound intimidating, but in practice the process involves a single screw that you first remove to connect the drive to your computer and then retighten to secure the SSD in place. As an added bonus, there aren’t any wires involved, making cable management easier. Note that you can install a SATA M.2 SSD into an M.2 slot with a PCIe connection, but you can’t insert an NVMe M.2 SSD into a M.2 slot with a SATA connection. Unless you want to continue using an old M.2 drive, there’s little reason to take advantage of that feature. Speaking of backward compatibility, it’s also possible to use a Gen4 drive through a PCIe 3 connection, but you won’t get any of the speed benefits of the faster NVMe. One last thing to consider is that M.2 drives come in different physical sizes. From shortest to longest, the common options are 2230, 2242, 2260, 2280 and 22110. (The first two numbers represent width in millimeters and the latter denote the length.) For the most part, you don’t have to worry about that since 2280 is the default for many motherboards and manufacturers. Some boards can accommodate more than one size of NVMe SSD thanks to multiple standoffs. That said, check your computer’s documentation or firmware before buying a drive to ensure you’re picking up a compatible size. If you’re buying a replacement SSD for the Steam Deck or Steam Deck OLED, things are less complicated. For Valve’s handheld, you will need a 2230 size NVMe. Simple. If you don’t want to open your Steam Deck, it’s also possible to expand its storage by installing a microSD card. Engadget has a separate guide dedicated to SD card storage, so check that out for additional buying advice. I alluded to this earlier, but the best buying advice I can offer is don’t get too caught up about being on the bleeding edge of storage tech. The sequential read and write speeds you see manufacturers list on their drives are theoretical and real-world performance benchmark tests vary less than you think. If your budget forces you to choose between a 1TB Gen3 NVMe and a 512GB Gen4 model, go for the higher-capacity one. From a practical standpoint, the worst thing you can do is buy a type of SSD that’s too small for needs. Drives can slow dramatically as they approach capacity, and you will probably end up purchasing one with a higher gigabyte capacity in the future. What to look for in portable and USB flash drives Portable SSDs are a somewhat different beast to their internal siblings. While read and write speeds are important, they are almost secondary to how an external drive connects to your PC. You won’t get the most out of a model like the SanDisk Extreme Pro V2 without a USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2 connection. Even among newer PCs, that’s something of a premium feature. For that reason, most people are best off buying a portable drive with a USB 3.2 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt connection. The former offers transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. The best external hard drives also allow you to transfer data from your Windows PC to a Mac, or other device, if compatible. Be sure to consider this beforehand if you plan to use your portable drive across multiple devices. Additionally, if you plan to take your drive on trips and commutes, it’s worthwhile to buy a model with IP-certified water and dust proofing. Some companies like Samsung offer rugged versions of their most popular drives, including the Samsung SSD T7 Shield, with a high endurance rating. For additional peace of mind, 256-bit AES hardware encryption will help prevent someone from accessing your data if you ever lose or misplace your external SSD. Some of the same features contribute to a great thumbstick drive. Our favorite picks for best budget external SSD models feature USB 3.0 connections and some form of hardware encryption. A note on console storage Seagate If PC gaming isn’t your thing and you own an Xbox Series X|S or PS5, outfitting your fancy new console with the fastest possible storage is far more straightforward than doing the same on PC. With a Series X or Series S, your options are limited to options from Seagate and Western Digital. The former offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB models, with the most affordable starting at a not-so-trivial $90. Western Digital’s Expansion Cards are less expensive, with pricing starting at $80 for the 512GB model. The good news is that both options are frequently on sale. Your best bet is to set an alert for the model you want by using a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel. With Sony’s PlayStation 5, upgrading the console’s internal storage is slightly more involved. Instead of employing a proprietary solution, the PS5 uses NVMe storage. Thankfully, there aren’t as many potential configurations as you would find on a PC. Engadget maintains a comprehensive guide to the best SSDs for PS5; in short, your best bet is a high-capacity Gen4 drive with a built-in heatsink. Check out that guide for a full list of gaming SSD recommendations, but for a quick go-to, consider the Corsair MP600 Pro LPX I recommend above. It meets all the memory specifications for Sony’s latest console and you won’t run into any clearance issues with the heatsink. Corsair offers 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB and 8TB versions of the drive. Expect to pay about $110 for the 1TB variant and about $200 for 2TB. For those still playing on a previous generation console, you can get slightly faster game load times from a PlayStation 4 by swapping the included hard drive to a 2.5-inch SSD, but going out of your way to do so probably isn’t worth it at this point and you’re better off saving your money for one of the new consoles and updating your operating system instead. SSD FAQs What size SSD is best? There is no one size fits all rule for SSDs, but we generally recommend getting at least a 1TB SSD if you’re looking to upgrade PC or game console storage, or looking to add an external drive to your toolkit. A 1TB drive will be plenty for most people who need extra storage space for photos, documents and programs. If you’re a hardcore gamer, you may want to invest in even more storage considering many high-profile titles today can take up a ton of space. Is a 256GB SSD better than a 1TB hard drive? The short answer is that it depends on what you need your drive for. In general, SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs, but HDDs are usually cheaper. We recommend springing for an SSD for most use cases today — upgrading a PC, saving important photos and documents, storing games long term, etc. But if you’re focused on getting the most amount of extra space possible (and sticking to a budget), an HDD could be a good option for you. Does bigger SSD mean faster? Getting a bigger SSD doesn’t always translate into a faster drive overall. A bigger SSD will provide a higher storage capacity, which means more space for storing digital files and programs. To understand how fast an SSD will be, you’ll want to look at its read/write speeds: read speeds measure how fast a drive can access information, while write speeds measure how fast the drive can save information. Most SSDs list their approximate read/write speeds in their specs, so be sure to check out those numbers before you make a purchase.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ssds-140014262.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-12-23T10:01:02", "collected_date": "2025-12-24T00:04:33.368008", "language": "en", "tags": ["Technology & Electronics", "gadgets", "provider_name|Engadget", "site|engadget", "region|US", "consumer", "author_name|Igor Bonifacic", "headline", "technology", "Computing", "language|en-US", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 1964, "author": "Igor Bonifacic", "raw_content_length": 14397, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 9.82, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "a96d6ba5b6df15dce962898f71215520", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 8.5, "reasoning": "The article is a definitive 'Best X to buy' listicle, explicitly guiding readers on purchasing SSDs.

We argue that superior finite-horizon performance requires \\emph{rapid convergence} to a \\emph{high-quality} policy. Thus motivated, we introduce a reformulation of online RBs as a \\emph{budgeted thresholding contextual bandit}, which simplifies the learning problem by encoding long-term state transitions into a scalar reward. We prove the first non-asymptotic optimality of an oracle policy for a simplified finite-horizon setting. We propose a practical learning policy under a heterogeneous-agent, multi-state setting, and show that it achieves a sublinear regret, achieving \\emph{faster convergence} than existing methods. This directly translates to higher cumulative reward, as empirically validated by significant gains over state-of-the-art algorithms in large-scale heterogeneous environments. Our work provides a new pathway for achieving practical, sample-efficient learning in finite-horizon RBs.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05145", "published_date": "2025-10-07T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-07T06:39:29.165307", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "research", "cslg", "computer-science", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 153, "author": "Jiamin Xu, Ivan Nazarov, Aditya Rastogi, \\'Africa Peri\\'a\\~nez, Kyra Gan", "raw_content_length": 1202, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.765, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["MDP"], "persons": ["\\emph{faster"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1201, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Restless", "Contextual", "A Thresholding Bandit Reformulation", "Finite", "Announce Type", "Abstract", "This paper", "the poor finite-horizon performance", "existing online emphrestless bandit", "algorithms"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["algorithms"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Restless": 2.0, "Contextual": 2.0, "A Thresholding Bandit Reformulation": 2.0, "Finite": 2.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "This paper": 1.0, "the poor finite-horizon performance": 1.0, "existing online emphrestless bandit": 1.0, "algorithms": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.752516415277778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 4.8709999999999996, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.0258, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.883, "joy": 0.0098, "surprise": 0.0202, "sadness": 0.0133, "fear": 0.0216, "anger": 0.0352, "disgust": 0.0169}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract from a scientific research paper hosted on arXiv.

This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15937", "published_date": "2025-12-19T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-12-19T16:04:35.031213", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "math-ph", "preprints", "math.MP", "mathematics", "math.AP", "math.CV", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 207, "author": "Andreas Chatziafratis", "raw_content_length": 1658, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.035, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "731e6215adb28587cb0e98943ddb6204", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract for a scientific paper on mathematics, published on arXiv.

{"id": "ai_engadget_a9dddecb2f00", "title": "The best earbuds for Android devices in 2025", "content": "Justified or not, Apple‚Äôs AirPods have become the default choice for most iPhone owners in the market for new wireless earbuds. If you‚Äôre shopping for an Android phone, however, the top picks aren‚Äôt so obvious. That‚Äôs where we can help: We‚Äôve tested dozens of wireless earbuds over the years, so we‚Äôve broken down our top recommendations for Android users below. Whether you want powerful noise cancellation, a pair that‚Äôll survive in the gym or just something that works particularly well with a Galaxy or Pixel phone, here are our favorite AirPods alternatives for Android. Table of contents The best Android earbuds for 2025 What to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices How we test Android earbuds Recent updates Best Android earbuds for 2025 What to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget For the most part, the features you want from a set of ‚ÄúAndroid earbuds‚Äù are the same as what you want from any headphones. Great sound quality, a comfortable fit and sufficient battery life are still the foundations. Adequate water resistance is good for workouts, and nobody wants a crummy mic for making calls. Once you approach the $100 range, features like active noise cancellation (ANC), wireless charging, an ambient sound mode (which lets you better hear outside noise without turning off your music) and multipoint connectivity (the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously) should be expected. For Android devices specifically, there are a few extras to consider. A dedicated app that makes it easy to switch sound modes, customize the audio profile, locate your earbuds if they ever get misplaced or adjust other settings is strongly preferred. Features like Google Fast Pair or NFC-based pairing, which can help you avoid having to dig through your Bluetooth menu to connect your earbuds for the first time, are also nice perks. Some Android devices can also utilize higher-quality Bluetooth codecs such as aptX Adaptive or Sony‚Äôs LDAC ‚Äî these aren‚Äôt nearly as important to audio quality as the actual architecture of your earbuds, but they can help wring out a little more detail if the buds are capable enough and you‚Äôre streaming lossless files. AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming. Diversity is Android‚Äôs greatest strength, but it also means that some wireless earbuds play nicer with certain devices, typically those made by the same company. Recent Samsung earbuds, for instance, come with a few perks that are only available if you use a Galaxy phone. We have a couple of recommendations related to this idea above. How we test Android earbuds Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget The best way to test earphones is simply to wear them as much as possible, so that‚Äôs what we do. We typically do this over a one- to two-week period, though embargo times occasionally force us to finish our review process a bit faster. We listen to a test playlist that includes several musical genres and podcasts, paying close attention to how each pair approaches the bass, mid and treble frequencies to get an accurate sense of its sound profile. We also test at high and low volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. We do not have access to a dummy head to take more objective measurements, but we‚Äôll sometimes look to sites like Rtings, SoundGuys and others that do just to ensure our impressions are not wildly off-base. If a model supports custom EQ, we‚Äôll tinker with that and use the available EQ presets to see if one sounds dramatically better than the others ‚Äî though in general we base most of our impressions on the stock tuning each pair uses by default. To assess microphone quality, we record our own audio samples and take multiple calls with a partner both indoors and outside. For battery life, we play our test playlist on a loop with the volume around 75 percent and measure how long it takes for each set to drain. Where applicable, we do a thorough review of a pair‚Äôs companion app and test each available feature. While comfort is ultimately subjective, we take note of how secure each pair feels while we‚Äôre on the move. We also use certain pairs in especially crowded public spaces to get a better sense of their passive and active noise cancellation, as well as their ability to maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection. Recent updates November 2025: The lightly updated Beats Powerbeats Fit replace the older Beats Fit Pro as our top pick for working out. We‚Äôve also noted the new Google Pixel Buds 2a as a cheaper alternative to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which remain our recommendation for Pixel phone users. August 2025: We‚Äôve taken another sweep to ensure our advice is still up-to-date. May 2025: We‚Äôve checked this guide to ensure our top picks still stand and noted a couple alternatives to the Noble Fokus Rex5, since that pair has had stock issues of late. We‚Äôre also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration‚Äôs tariff policy affects the pricing and stock of our recommendations (and the consumer tech industry as a whole). All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we‚Äôll update this guide if that changes. February 2025: The Noble FoKus Rex5 is our new \"best for sound quality\" pick, replacing the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4. Our other recommendations remain unchanged. December 2024: We‚Äôve lightly edited this guide for clarity and ensured that our current picks are still accurate.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

These substrates must operate reliably in heterogeneous and permissionless environments, where Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls impose significant constraints. Existing solutions, however, are either designed for controlled data center deployments or implemented as monolithic systems that tightly couple machine learning logic with networking code. To address these limitations, we present Lattica, a decentralized cross-NAT communication framework designed to support distributed AI systems. Lattica integrates three core components. First, it employs a robust suite of NAT traversal mechanisms to establish a globally addressable peer-to-peer mesh. Second, it provides a decentralized data store based on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring verifiable and eventually consistent state replication. Third, it incorporates a content discovery layer that leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) together with an optimized RPC protocol for efficient model synchronization. By integrating these components, Lattica delivers a complete protocol stack for sovereign, resilient, and scalable AI systems that operate independently of centralized intermediaries. It is directly applicable to edge intelligence, collaborative reinforcement learning, and other large-scale distributed machine learning scenarios.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00183", "published_date": "2025-10-02T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-02T06:38:44.245830", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "research", "computer-science", "csdc", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 194, "author": "Ween Yang, Jason Liu, Suli Wang, Xinyuan Song, Lynn Ai, Eric Yang, Tianyu Shi", "raw_content_length": 1543, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.97, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Artificial Intelligence (AI", "Network Address Translators", "CRD", "NAT"], "persons": ["Lattica", "Announce Type"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1542, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["A Decentralized Cross", "arXiv251000183v1 Announce Type", "new Abstract", "The rapid expansion", "distributed Artificial Intelligence", "centralized data centers", "a demand", "new communication substrates", "These substrates", "heterogeneous and permissionless environments"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["distributed Artificial Intelligence"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"A Decentralized Cross": 2.0, "arXiv251000183v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "The rapid expansion": 1.0, "distributed Artificial Intelligence": 1.0, "centralized data centers": 1.0, "a demand": 1.0, "new communication substrates": 1.0, "These substrates": 1.0, "heterogeneous and permissionless environments": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.8011697013888885, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.062000000000001, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.6124, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an abstract for a scientific paper published on arXiv, detailing a new technical framework ('Lattica') for decentralized AI communication.

This study conceptualizes ionization dose to water, which is the absorbed dose to water expended on ionization, to represent biologically more relevant doses. Based on the international code of practice for ionization chamber dosimetry with cobalt calibration, the procedures to measure ionization dose were formulated for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. Nitrogen-based water-equivalent gas (WEG) mixtures were designed for proton and ion beams. The proposed procedures were theoretically simulated for test beams of respective types. The calibrated ionization dose virtually measured with a common ionization chamber was identical to the absorbed dose for high-energy photon and electron beams, and was reasonably compatible with uncertainty reduced from 1.4% to 1.3% for a proton beam and from 2.4% to 1.9% for an ion beam. With an WEG ionization chamber, the uncertainty was further reduced to 0.7% for the proton beam and 1.0% for the ion beam. The new dose concept, calibrated ionization dose to water, may be used directly in current radiotherapy practice with reduced uncertainty. Its minimized beam-quality correction will be advantageous for complex clinical beams of various types and in non-reference conditions not covered by the standard dosimetry protocols. It is also less affected by nuclear energies, which have been overlooked in the long-established dosimetric concepts including absorbed dose.", "source": "science_arxiv_physics", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21948", "published_date": "2025-10-16T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T06:40:39.871967", "language": "en", "tags": ["physics", "preprints", "research", "physicsmed-ph", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "physics updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 232, "author": "Nobuyuki Kanematsu", "raw_content_length": 1597, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.16, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Nitrogen", "WEG"], "persons": ["Announce Type"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1596, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["water", "ionization", "Conceptualization", "dosimetry", "external beam radiotherapy", "ionization dose", "arXiv241021948v5 Announce Type", "Abstract", "Absorbed dose", "temperature rise"], "filter_categories": {"engineering": ["external beam radiotherapy"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"water": 4.0, "ionization": 3.0, "Conceptualization": 2.0, "dosimetry": 2.0, "external beam radiotherapy": 2.0, "ionization dose": 2.0, "arXiv241021948v5 Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Absorbed dose": 1.0, "temperature rise": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.781044217777778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 3.8685, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.2263, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8257, "joy": 0.012, "surprise": 0.0526, "sadness": 0.0119, "fear": 0.0371, "anger": 0.0284, "disgust": 0.0324}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "This content is an abstract from a scientific research paper published on arXiv.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_7c4e187d395f", "title": "Efficient Distributed Training via Dual Batch Sizes and Cyclic Progressive Learning", "content": "arXiv:2509.26092v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Distributed machine learning is critical for training deep learning models on large datasets and with numerous parameters. Current research primarily focuses on leveraging additional hardware resources and powerful computing units to accelerate the training process. As a result, larger batch sizes are often employed to speed up training. However, training with large batch sizes can lead to lower accuracy due to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose the dual batch size learning scheme, a distributed training method built on the parameter server framework. This approach maximizes training efficiency by utilizing the largest batch size that the hardware can support while incorporating a smaller batch size to enhance model generalization. By using two different batch sizes simultaneously, this method reduces testing loss and enhances generalization, with minimal extra training time. Additionally, to mitigate the time overhead caused by dual batch size learning, we propose the cyclic progressive learning scheme. This technique gradually adjusts image resolution from low to high during training, significantly boosting training speed. By combining cyclic progressive learning with dual batch size learning, our hybrid approach improves both model generalization and training efficiency. Experimental results using ResNet-18 show that, compared to conventional training methods, our method can improve accuracy by 3.3% while reducing training time by 10.6% on CIFAR-100, and improve accuracy by 0.1% while reducing training time by 35.7% on ImageNet.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26092", "published_date": "2025-10-01T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-01T06:39:42.286448", "language": "en", "tags": ["csdc", "research", "preprints", "computer-science", "cslg", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 230, "author": "Kuan-Wei Lu, Ding-Yong Hong, Pangfeng Liu, Jan-Jan Wu", "raw_content_length": 1626, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.15, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Cyclic Progressive Learning arXiv:2509.26092v1"], "persons": ["Dual Batch Sizes"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1625, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Efficient", "Training", "Dual Batch Sizes", "Cyclic Progressive Learning", "training", "Announce Type", "new Abstract", "Distributed machine learning", "deep learning models", "large datasets"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Training", "Distributed machine learning", "deep learning models"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Efficient": 2.0, "Training": 2.0, "Dual Batch Sizes": 2.0, "Cyclic Progressive Learning": 2.0, "training": 2.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "Distributed machine learning": 1.0, "deep learning models": 1.0, "large datasets": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.746147605, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.553000000000001, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.5106, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "This content is a scientific research paper from arXiv, detailing a new method in distributed machine learning.

{"id": "ai_engadget_75d1669602ff", "title": "What's next for Vision Pro? Apple should take a cue from Xreal's smart glasses", "content": "Forget Samsung's $1,800 Galaxy XR, the Android XR device I'm actually intrigued to see is Xreal's Project Aura, an evolution of the company's existing smart glasses. Instead of being an expensive and bulky headset like the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro, Xreal's devices are like over-sized sunglasses that project a virtual display atop transparent lenses. I genuinely loved Xreal's $649 One Pro for its comfort, screen size and relative affordability. Now that I'm testing the M5-equipped Vision Pro (full review to come soon!), it's clearer than ever that Apple should replicate Xreal's winning formula. It'll be a long while before we'll ever see a smaller Vision Pro-like device under $1,000, but Apple could easily build a similar set of comfortable smart glasses that more people could actually afford. And if they worked like Xreal's glasses, they'd also be far more useful than something like Meta's $800 Ray-Ban Display, which only has a small screen for notifications and quick tasks like video chats. Xreal One Pro smart glassesDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhile we don't have any pricing details for Project Aura yet, given Xreal's history of delivering devices between $200 and $649, I'd bet they'll come in cheaper than the Galaxy XR. Xreal's existing hardware is less complex than the Vision Pro and Galaxy XR, with smaller displays, a more limited field of view and no built-in battery. Project Aura differs a bit with its tethered computing puck, which will be used to power Android XR and presumably hold a battery. That component alone could drive its price up to $1,000 — but hey, that's better than $1,800.During my time with the M5 Vision Pro, I couldn't help but imagine how Apple could bring visionOS to its own Xreal-like hardware, which I'll call the \"Vision Air\" for this thought experiment. The basic sunglasses design is easy enough to replicate, and I could see Apple leaning into lighter and more premium materials to make wearing the Vision Air even more comfortable than Xreal's devices. There's no doubt it would be lighter than the 1.6-pound Vision Pro, and since you'd still be seeing the real world, it also avoids the sense of being trapped in a dark VR headset. To power the Vision Air, Apple could repurpose the Vision Pro's battery pack and turn it into a computing puck like Project Aura's. It wouldn't need the full capabilities of the M5 chip, it would just have to be smart enough to juggle virtual windows, map objects in 3D space and run most visionOS apps. The Vision Air also wouldn't need the full array of cameras and sensors from the Vision Pro, just enough track your fingers and eyes. I could also see Apple matching, or even surpassing, Project Aura's 70-degree field of view, which is already a huge leap beyond the Xreal One Pro's 57-degree FOV. Xreal's earlier devices were severely limited by a small FOV, which meant that you could only see virtual screens through a tiny sliver. (That's a problem that also plagued early AR headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens.) While wearing the Xreal One Pro, though, I could see a huge 222-inch virtual display within my view. Pushing the FOV even higher would be even more immersive.In my review of the original Vision Pro, I wrote, \"If Apple just sold a headset that virtualized your Mac's screen for $1,000 this well, I'd imagine creative professionals and power users would be all over it.\" That may be an achievable goal for the Vision Air, especially if it's not chasing total XR immersion. And even if the Apple tax pushed the price up to $1,500, it would still be more sensible than the Vision Pro’s $3,500 cost. While I don’t have high hopes for Android XR, its mere existence should be enough to push Apple to double-down on visionOS and deliver something people can actually afford. If Xreal can design comfortable and functional smart glasses for a fraction of the Vision Pro’s cost, why can't Apple?

{"id": "ai_engadget_8dca70a599db", "title": "Apple's AirPods Pro 3 drop to $230 on Amazon", "content": "If you haven't yet upgraded to Apple's AirPods Pro 3, you can pick up the company's latest model at a discount through a deal on Amazon right now. The AirPods Pro 3, which came out in September, are currently $20 off, bringing their price down to $230. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple made some big improvements, including better battery life and sound quality, and introduced useful new features, such as Live Translation. The AirPods Pro 3 are the best AirPods available today, with Apple's H2 chip, and earned a score of 90 out of 100 in Engadget's review this fall. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is one of the biggest selling points of the AirPods Pro, and Apple has made the experience even better with the AirPods Pro 3. They sport new foam-infused ear tips that create a better seal to improve passive noise isolation, and as Engadget's Billy Steele wrote in his review, \"Ultra-low-noise microphones combine with advanced computational audio to silence even more background noise.\" In testing, they had no problem blocking out the chatter of people nearby or otherwise noisy environments. With the AirPods Pro 3, Apple introduced heart-rate sensing, so you'll be able to see your heart rate data from the earbuds in the Fitness app and other workout apps. The AirPods Pro 3 also boast Live Translation, which you can activate via controls on the earbuds themselves. As long as you have an Apple Intelligence-capable device, you'll be able to translate in-person conversations in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese (Mandarin).

{"id": "ai_engadget_497e33b8df2e", "title": "iOS 26.1 could arrive this week with a toggle to reduce the Liquid Glass effect", "content": "All the complaining about the Liquid Glass redesign may have amounted to some real change, since Apple could be offering a compromise with its forthcoming iOS update. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is getting ready to release iOS 26.1, which will have a toggle to reduce the Liquid Glass effect. Gurman said the iOS 26.1 update could roll out to users as early as Monday, while the first beta version of iOS 26.2 should arrive for developers the day after. Liquid Glass was introduced at WWDC 2025 as Apple's next big visual overhaul. It didn't take long for users to test it out and offer up criticisms about the readability and lag caused by the animations. To address these grievances, Apple introduced an option to apply a tinted setting to its transparent redesign in iOS 26.1's fourth beta. While the upcoming iOS update won't introduce anything groundbreaking, Gurman said that the latest update will be \"more reliable, with fewer bugs.\" Besides the toggle option, iOS 26.1 will have an updated Apple TV icon and other bug fixes, according to Gurman. Looking ahead, Apple is likely to follow the same update pattern as usual, meaning macOS 26.1 and the first beta of watchOS 26.2 should follow.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

{"id": "ai_engadget_612c92c2b0ac", "title": "Black Friday Apple deals include $100 off the Mac mini M4", "content": "While there are lots of great Black Friday sales on cheaper devices, it's the big ticket items that really make a world of difference. Take Apple's 2024 Mac mini M4, which has dropped to $499 from $599 as part of early Black Friday deals. The 17 percent discount brings Apple's mini desktop computer with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD to only $30 more than its all-time low. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

{"id": "ai_engadget_8bcba21bc36d", "title": "Survival climbing game Cairn has been delayed until 2026", "content": "The survival climbing game Cairn has been delayed until the first quarter of 2026. Development studio The Game Bakers had previously announced a release date for November 5 of this year. The delay is so the team can spend more time on \"optimization, debug and polish.\" Creative director Emeric Thoa said that \"after 5 years of work, it makes no sense to rush it\" as \"we want to be proud of the game we launch.\" Delays are never fun, but they are a whole lot better than buying a broken game at launch. We don't have an actual release date yet, but the game's still coming to both PC and PS5. There is a demo available, which has racked up 600,000 players on both platforms. The Game Bakers are beefing up that demo on October 13, adding ghost recordings of speedrunners and staffers. The company says these ghosts can be followed to \"check new techniques or discover new routes and hidden areas.\" Mario Kart and other racing games have been doing something similar for years. For the uninitiated, Cairn is a tough-as-nails rock-climbing game with a free solo mode for added difficulty. There's no UI feedback, so players have to pay attention to the avatar's breathing and body language. It feels like a more intense cousin of the peaceful Jusant, which is another rock-climbing sim.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/survival-climbing-game-cairn-has-been-delayed-until-2026-171512591.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/survival-climbing-game-cairn-has-been-delayed-until-2026-171512591.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-09-30T17:04:26", "collected_date": "2025-09-30T18:37:28.356076", "language": "en", "tags": ["siteengadget", "technology", "consumer", "gadgets", "sports_recreation", "media", "headline", "video_games", "regionus", "languageen-us"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 232, "author": "Lawrence Bonk", "raw_content_length": 2094, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.16, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["The Game Bakers", "Cairn"], "persons": ["Emeric Thoa", "Mario Kart"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1442, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["game", "The survival climbing game Cairn", "the first quarter", "The Game Bakers", "a release date", "November", "this year", "The delay", "the team", "more time"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["The survival climbing game Cairn"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"game": 2.0, "The survival climbing game Cairn": 1.0, "the first quarter": 1.0, "The Game Bakers": 1.0, "a release date": 1.0, "November": 1.0, "this year": 1.0, "The delay": 1.0, "the team": 1.0, "more time": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 1.7727215463888888, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 5.1045, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.0209, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 2.5, "reasoning": "The article is primarily news reporting about a video game's development delay.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_f78ff72d0ca4", "title": "Real-World Usability of Vulnerability Proof", "content": "arXiv:2510.18448v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability, completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of 470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method, which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in strengthening software security.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type":

{"id": "ai_engadget_20da32c6c572", "title": "Black Friday 2025 deals from Amazon, Apple, Lego, Ninja and more are ready to shop now ahead of the year's biggest sale", "content": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier ‚Äî to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pok√©mon fans should consider the Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Ring Video Doorbell for $50 (50 percent off): This is the most affordable Ring doorbell and it includes a battery that's rechargeable via USB-C. Once installed, it will send you alerts when motion is detected near your door, and you can use the Live View and two-way talk features to interact with visitors without opening your door. Blink Mini 2 (2 pack) for $28 (60 percent off): if you want to keep an eye on your home when you're away, it'll be hard to find a security camera as convenient and as affordable as a Blink Mini 2. Yes, the company just came out the with 2K+ version, but that will be overkill for most people. The Blink Mini 2 gets the job done by recording 1080p video, sending you motion alerts and supporting two-way talk in case you want to chat with your pets while you're out. Note that these are wired cameras, so they're more conveniently used indoors ‚Äî unless you pick up the necessary weather-resistant adapter for outdoor use. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $40 ($10 off): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. PowerA Mario Joy wireless controller for $27 (46 percent off): This controller would make an excellent gift for any Nintendo fan, even those who already have a Switch 2 since it's compatible with the new console. It runs on two AA batteries, which should last for 40 hours of playtime before they need to be replaced. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. More Black Friday tech deals GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. EcoFlow Black Friday deals ‚Äî get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599.

However, their performance on high-resolution images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize small objects, leading them to use \"zoom in\" strategies for better detail, our analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze this \"zoom in\" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free approach.

Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy. As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.", "source": "science_arxiv_physics", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21295", "published_date": "2025-12-12T05:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-12-12T20:02:57.458925", "language": "en", "tags": ["physics", "preprints", "physics.app-ph", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "physics updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 209, "author": "Wenbo Fan, Weihua Gu", "raw_content_length": 1534, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.045, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "b636b509a2b52aceb061e17e1210ec9b", "_sample_bucket": "journalism", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The content is an academic research paper (from arXiv) introducing a novel mobility system concept.

Rather than focusing on classification accuracy, we study how each method characterizes intrinsic dimensionality, shared variation, and nonlinear geometry. PCA reveals dominant global variance directions and enables high-fidelity reconstructions using a small number of components. FA decomposes digits into interpretable latent handwriting primitives corresponding to strokes, loops, and symmetry. UMAP uncovers nonlinear manifolds that reflect smooth stylistic transitions between digit classes.

{"id": "ai_engadget_bb60e01fe44b", "title": "How to use a VPN on iPhone", "content": "Installing a virtual private network (VPN) on an iPhone or iPad is easy. The days are gone when Apple users had to be content with the leavings from the Windows ecosystem ‚Äî in 2026, all the best VPN services have secure, user-friendly iOS apps on par with every other platform. If you've decided to add a VPN to your iPhone to stay anonymous online and change your virtual location, you've got plenty of great choices.Since you're here, chances are you're familiar with the benefits of using a VPN, including security on public Wi-Fi and the ability to explore streaming libraries in other countries. But you may still be daunted by the process of actually choosing, installing and configuring a VPN on your iPhone.In this article, I'll walk you through the steps, including how to configure a VPN manually without going through a service. Check out my how to use a VPN piece for more general information.How to choose an iPhone VPNOne of the trickiest parts of installing an iPhone VPN is picking the right service. That brings us to our first pro tip: Don‚Äôt just go to the App Store and search on ‚ÄúVPN.‚Äù That will simply front-load whichever vendor(s) are paying for top placement (note the little ‚ÄúAd‚Äù icon) as well as a laundry list of free services that come with big caveats. There are dozens of mobile VPNs out there, and many of them don't put the user first (for example, I reported last year on popular VPNs that failed to disclose shared security flaws). Choosing hastily can leave you stuck with an iOS VPN that's either mediocre or actively harmful.Before downloading an iPhone VPN, do some research into the provider's background. A dependable VPN should have a well-written customer support page, a clear timeline of its history and a way to tell at a glance who actually owns and operates it. Check the reviews on the app store ‚Äî it should have at least several hundred, almost all 4s and 5s.iPhone users have a particular advantage here: several VPNs let you download their iOS app and start using it without paying. You can use this free trial period to put the VPN through its paces. Start by testing its speed using Ookla speedtest or a similar app. You should also use an IP address checker to make sure it isn't leaking; to confirm this, just check your phone's IP address before and after connecting to the VPN and make sure it's different the second time.To keep things simple, my top recommendation for all platforms is Proton VPN. Out of all VPNs, it strikes the best balance of solid security, fast performance, useful features and a commitment to user privacy. Other iPhone VPNs I love include ExpressVPN, Surfshark and NordVPN.How to install a VPN on your iPhoneInstalling an iPhone VPN is like installing any other app. Just go to the App Store, find the VPN you've chosen and download it onto your phone. When it finishes downloading, open the app to grant permissions and finish setup. However, since there are a couple of potential sticking points, I'll run through the steps in more detail.Proton VPN on the iOS app store.Sam Chapman for EngadgetOpen the App Store.Tap the search bar and type in the name of your chosen VPN. Hit Search and look through the list of results. Be careful to pick the right one ‚Äî there are some \"mockbuster\" VPNs that try to snare people looking for well-known names. As a rule, the one with the most reviews is the service worth using.On the page for the VPN app, tap Get. Enter your Apple ID and password to begin the installation.Once installation is complete, either tap Open in the App Store or find the new VPN icon on your home screen.Create a VPN account with a username and password. Most services let you do this within the app, but you may have to shift temporarily to a browser, so make sure you've got internet access.Choose a subscription. If there's a free trial, grab it and use it to test the VPN. If not, or if it's already expired, choose a plan that fits your budget and needs. Longer-term plans tend to save you money on average, but cost more at the start.On the VPN app, log in with your new credentials. You're now ready to get started.If you aren't interested in paying for software right now, you can still get an iOS VPN. Check out my list of the best free VPNs, which all have iPhone apps. We also constantly update a curated list of the best VPN deals for bargain hunters.How to configure and use a VPN on your iPhoneAn iOS VPN is generally usable with the default settings. Even so, it's a good idea to look through the options ‚Äî you may not end up using all of them, but many of them are vital security checks or important quality-of-life boosters.Proton VPN's NetShield content blocker on iOS.Sam Chapman for EngadgetHere are some quick steps to make sure you're getting the best performance. These settings are in different places on each VPN, but most can be found by clicking a button with a gear icon, or any page labeled \"settings\" or \"preferences.\"Turn on the kill switch. This will protect you from broadcasting any data the VPN hasn't encrypted. In the event the VPN suddenly disconnects, the kill switch also cuts off your internet connection.Set the VPN to always reconnect automatically if it disconnects. The method for doing this varies between services, so check the VPN's help page. Some (like Proton VPN) have an always-on VPN setting in the app itself, while others (like ExpressVPN) handle it through iOS settings.Configure split tunneling. Not many iPhone VPNs have this option, but if yours does, you can use it to let certain apps or websites skip the VPN tunnel. Make sure to only bypass the VPN on sites and apps that share no sensitive information, or that refuse to work with a VPN active (some banks are like this).If your VPN has a feature for blocking ads and malware domains, I recommend using it ‚Äî the worst it can do is not work. Some also include parental controls, in case you're setting up the VPN on your child's phone.Create shortcuts. Sometimes called Profiles, this relatively common feature lets you connect to the VPN and open a certain website with one tap.Decide when and how you want the VPN to send you notifications.Check available protocols. It's almost always best to let the VPN pick for you, but if you want to choose for yourself, IKEv2 is generally the fastest.Look over the server list to see what choices are available.When choosing a VPN server, think about what you need the VPN for. If you're just using it for privacy, pick the fastest server (or let the VPN app choose it for you). On the other hand, if you want to watch a movie or TV show that's only on streaming in another country, choose the fastest server in that country. If you're on a good VPN, it still shouldn't slow you down too much.If you have the address of a VPN server and the necessary credentials, iOS lets you set up your own VPN and connect directly. This is less convenient than using a provider app, since you need to know the details about every server you connect to, but it's nice if you're worried about trusting your privacy to a third party. It can also be convenient for quickly accessing a work or school VPN from your phone. Here's how to do it.Manually setting up a VPN connection on iOS.Sam Chapman for EngadgetOpen the Settings app. Scroll down and tap General.Scroll down again and tap VPN & Device Management. Tap the word VPN on the new page, then tap Add VPN Configuration. You should reach the screen shown above.Make sure Type is set to IKEv2, then enter the Description, Server and Remote ID for the server you're connecting to (plus the Local ID if there is one).Your source for the server information should also have told you if it authenticates access with a username/password or certificate. Pick the correct option, then enter the credentials required.Tap the Done button or the blue checkmark at the top-right of the screen.You'll arrive back on the previous menu with your new VPN option available. Toggle it on to connect. To turn it off, return to the same menu and deactivate the switch.Do you need an iPhone VPN?Whenever you get online, your internet service provider (ISP) assigns an IP address to your device ‚Äî a unique fingerprint that follows you throughout the session. Your ISP may sell this knowledge to marketers to target ads at you, or in worse cases, collaborate with governments willing to violate their citizens' rights to privacy.When you use a VPN, though, your real IP address is hidden behind that of the VPN server, so nothing you do on the internet connects back to you. That's why I always advise using a VPN on any device, including iPhones, that connects to the internet. It's even more important on the unprotected public networks you sometimes find in cafes and hotels. On the fun side, you can also use a VPN to change your virtual location to show you different content libraries on Netflix and other streaming platforms.One more thing: I often hear iPhone users ask whether they need a VPN, since iCloud Private Relay comes standard on iOS devices. Just to clear this up, iCloud Private Relay is not a VPN. As you can see from this support page, your ISP can still see your real IP address when it‚Äôs active.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-iphone-201743118.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2026-01-07T20:17:48", "collected_date": "2026-01-08T20:04:19.640912", "language": "en", "tags": ["Software", "gadgets", "region|US", "provider_name|Engadget", "Technology & Electronics", "language|en-US", "consumer", "headline", "technology", "author_name|Sam Chapman", "site|engadget", "ai"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 1625, "author": "Sam Chapman", "raw_content_length": 12687, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 8.125, "robust_parsing_used": true}, "content_hash": "b12fcc1e1a6ad7d5aaa60bf5aa3ce9f4", "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 7.0, "reasoning": "The article provides an educational 'how-to' guide for using a VPN on an iPhone.

Earlier this week, US District Court Judge Pamela Chen wrote in a decision that Shkreli has to face a lawsuit that accuses him of improperly saving copies and playing the one-of-a-kind album for followers, which reduced its value and exclusivity. The lawsuit was filed by PleasrDAO — which, according to its own website, is a collective of people involved with cryptocurrency, NFTs and digital art. Once Upon a Time in Shaolin has a strange ownership history, starting with Shkreli purchasing the one-of-one studio album in 2015 for $2 million. After a fraud conviction, Shkreli had to forfeit his assets, including the album, leading to PleasrDAO acquiring it in a government auction for $4 million. On top of the album's highly exclusive nature, it has a condition where it can't be \"commercially exploited for 88 years\" by any subsequent owners. The collective's argument stems from claims that Shkreli admitted in livestreams that he made copies of the album and played it for his followers, even allegedly posting \"LOL i have the mp3s you moron\" in response to a member of PleasrDAO posting a photo of the album. If PleasrDAO wins the case, Shkreli will have to give up any copies of the album, as well as provide info on all copies, who they were distributed to and what profits he made from it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/martin-shkreli-has-to-face-claims-of-copying-one-of-a-kind-wu-tang-clan-album-174730388.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/martin-shkreli-has-to-face-claims-of-copying-one-of-a-kind-wu-tang-clan-album-174730388.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-09-28T17:47:39", "collected_date": "2025-09-29T01:55:03.693691", "language": "en", "tags": ["consumer", "regionus", "arts_entertainment", "music", "technology", "languageen-us", "siteengadget", "gadgets", "headline", "media"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 268, "author": "Jackson Chen", "raw_content_length": 2222, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.34, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["PleasrDAO", "District Court", "Shkreli", "Daraprim"], "persons": ["Wu-Tang Clan", "Martin Shkreli", "Pamela Chen", "Pharma Bro"], "locations": ["Shaolin"], "monetary": ["$4 million", "$2 million"]}, "char_count": 1738, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Martin Shkreli", "claims", "Pharma Bro", "his price-gouging antics", "AIDS medication Daraprim", "trade secrets", "the unique Wu-Tang Clan album", "a Time", "Shaolin", "US District Court Judge Pamela Chen"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["claims"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Martin Shkreli": 3.0, "claims": 3.0, "Pharma Bro": 1.0, "his price-gouging antics": 1.0, "AIDS medication Daraprim": 1.0, "trade secrets": 1.0, "the unique Wu-Tang Clan album": 1.0, "a Time": 1.0, "Shaolin": 1.0, "US District Court Judge Pamela Chen": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 8.541074094722223, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 5.5135000000000005, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.1027, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}, "_sample_bucket": "commerce_source", "commerce_score": 1.0, "reasoning": "The article is a pure news report detailing a legal dispute involving Martin Shkreli and the Wu-Tang Clan album.
