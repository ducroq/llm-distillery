The construction of cascaded dams on the main stem of the Yangtze River has altered the natural water temperature regime, impacting the hydrothermal status of the water. Utilizing multi-source remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine to invert river surface water temperatures, a parameter-optimized CNN-LSTM-Attention hybrid interpretable water temperature prediction model was constructed. The model demonstrated credible accuracy. Based on the inversion results, the study revealed the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of water temperature in the main stem of the Yangtze River before and after cascaded dam construction in the lower Jinsha River region and the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The results found that after the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the annual average water temperature increased significantly by 0.813 °C. The “cold water stagnation effect” induced by cascaded development caused the water temperature amplitude to increase from 8.96 °C to 10.6 °C. Furthermore, the regulating effect of tributary confluence exhibited significant differences. For instance, colder tributaries like the Yalong River reduced the main stem water temperature, while warmer tributaries like the Jialing River, conversely, increased the main stem temperature. The construction of cascaded dams led to distinct variation characteristics in the areas downstream of the dams within the reservoir regions, where tributary inflows caused corresponding changes in the main stem water temperature. This study elucidates the long-term spatiotemporal variation characteristics of water temperature in the main stem of the Yangtze River. The model prediction results can assist in constructing an early warning indicator system for water temperature changes, providing reliable data support for promoting water environment sustainability and ecological civilization construction in the river basin.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9046","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.802099","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":289,"author":"Yang Zhou","raw_content_length":2132,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.445,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Google Earth Engine","the Spatiotemporal Effects of Water Temperature","CNN","the Construction of Cascade Dams"],"persons":[],"locations":["the Yangtze River"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2088,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Research","the Spatiotemporal Effects","Water Temperature","the Construction","Cascade Dams","the Yangtze River Main Stream","Optimized CNN","Hydrothermal conditions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"healthcare_tech":["Research"],"research_academic":["Research"],"engineering":["the Spatiotemporal Effects"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Research":2.0,"the Spatiotemporal Effects":2.0,"Water Temperature":2.0,"the Construction":2.0,"Cascade Dams":2.0,"the Yangtze River Main Stream":2.0,"Optimized CNN":2.0,"Hydrothermal conditions":1.0}},"age_hours":12.991559561944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7533,"joy":0.0172,"surprise":0.0386,"sadness":0.0218,"fear":0.0296,"anger":0.0594,"disgust":0.08},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research develops a model to predict water temperature changes due to dam construction, providing a tool for assessing environmental impacts.

This study addresses that gap by designing and simulating a zero-emission propulsion system for a 12.5 m sailing yacht based on integrated renewable energy. The retrofit replaces the diesel engine with an electric drivetrain supported by static solar panels and wind turbines, as well as dynamic sources, including hydro-generators and a regenerative propeller. In addition to performance under typical weather profiles, we conducted a lifecycle environmental impact estimation and evaluated system resilience under low renewable input. Simulations used real mid-latitude meteorological data to assess operational and environmental sustainability. The results show that during two representative 24 h voyages, propulsion and hotel loads were sustained solely by onboard renewables, with battery state of charge remaining above 28–46%. In an emergency calm scenario, the yacht motored for four hours at 5–6 knots using only stored energy, with solar input extending range. The findings demonstrate that integrated multi-source renewables can provide complete energy autonomy for sailing yachts. The approach illustrates practical feasibility under real conditions, scalability to eco-tour boats and ferries, and alignment with international decarbonization targets.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9050","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.802445","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"İsmail Çiçek","raw_content_length":1464,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hydro"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1444,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","a Sailboat","Solar Panels","Wind Turbines","Hydro","The decarbonization","maritime transport","large vessels","small craft"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"renewable_energy":["Wind Turbines"],"hydrogen_energy":["Hydro"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"a Sailboat":2.0,"Solar Panels":2.0,"Wind Turbines":2.0,"Hydro":2.0,"The decarbonization":1.0,"maritime transport":1.0,"large vessels":1.0,"small craft":1.0}},"age_hours":12.991574994166665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8892,"joy":0.016,"surprise":0.03,"sadness":0.0103,"fear":0.0087,"anger":0.02,"disgust":0.0256},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study simulates a zero-emission propulsion system for a sailing yacht using renewable energy sources.

Quinoa (a climate-resilient crop) offers potential for sustainable food production under these harsh conditions; however, its growth and yield are often constrained by salt and water stress. This study evaluated the role of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in enhancing Chenopodium quinoa Willd performance under deficit irrigation (DI) with saline water. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted with four irrigation levels (40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the growth water requirement, GWR) and two water qualities (fresh water, EC = 0.8 dS m−1; and saline water, EC = 6.0 dS m−1), each tested with and without PGPR inoculation. The results showed that PGPR application significantly (p < 0.05) improved quinoa tolerance to salinity, leading to higher biomass, yield, and crop water productivity (CWP) under saline irrigation. Yield reductions were most severe at 40% GWR (53.9% and 82.6% under saline and fresh water, respectively), but PGPR inoculation mitigated yield losses, with increases of 83.3% and 130.8% under 40% and 100% GWR saline irrigation, respectively. Notably, PGPR did not show a clear effect with freshwater irrigation. In addition, inoculated plants exhibited improved nutrient uptake and reduced heavy metal accumulation. Overall, PGPR demonstrated strong potential to enhance salinity resilience and water-use efficiency in quinoa. Future studies should extend these findings under field conditions and investigate the long-term impacts of PGPR on sustainable crop production in saline- and water-limited environments.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9048","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.802975","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Abdulaziz G.

Archival weekly-integrated samples from the summer season were collected at eight industrially influenced sites in southern Poland. Sequential extraction (F1–F2) and ICP-MS were applied to quantify concentrations of cadmium, cobalt, chromium, nickel, and lead in PM2.5 and PM10. Aggregated hazard values were then derived with TOPSIS, and site similarity was explored using Czekanowski’s reordered distance matrices. Regulatory targets for cadmium and nickel, and the limit for lead in PM10 were not exceeded, but F1/F2 profiles revealed pronounced site-to-site differences in potential mobility that were not evident from total concentrations. Rankings were consistent across size fractions, with site P1 exhibiting the lowest hazard indices and P8 the highest, while mid-rank sites formed reproducible similarity clusters. The proposed chemical-fractionation and multivariate framework provides a reproducible screening tool for multi-element exposure, complementing compliance checks and supporting prioritisation of sites for targeted investigation and environmental management.

However, it remains unclear how these perceptions become specific livelihood strategies through internal psychological processes. To address this, this study constructs an analytical framework. It integrates multidimensional environmental perceptions, risk aversion, and livelihood strategies. Particular focus is given to the mediating role of risk aversion in the link between perception of environmental change and livelihood strategy. The proposed mechanism is tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings indicate that farmers pursue both adaptive and defensive livelihood strategies. They balance security with development opportunities. Perceptions of ecological transition and market volatility significantly affect both adaptive and defensive strategies. Perception of social dynamics mainly influences adaptive strategies. The perception of policy adjustment has no significant effect. Risk aversion mediates these relationships.

Evidence from China","content":"Corporate carbon information disclosure (CID) is gradually transitioning from being voluntary to mandatory, consistent with the global consensus on addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development. CID reflects corporate environmental performance and is a crucial source for the market to comprehend corporate environmental risks and assess their long-term value. However, corporate operations are often influenced by managers’ behavioral preferences when formulating disclosure strategies, as managerial cognitive vision and values directly affect strategic decisions. This study used a sample of Chinese A-share-listed companies for 2010 to 2023 to investigate the relationship between managerial myopia and CID. The findings indicate that managerial myopia significantly inhibits CID by reducing executive environmental awareness and corporate green innovation capabilities. A heterogeneity analysis shows that managerial myopia has a stronger inhibitory effect on CID in companies with weak governance structures and those that are not technology-intensive, providing valuable references for environmental performance and CID practice in emerging countries.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9042","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.804557","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Yunjian Yang","raw_content_length":1186,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CID","China Corporate","Managerial Myopia Affect Corporate Carbon Information"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1176,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Managerial Myopia","Corporate Carbon Information Disclosure","Evidence","China","CID","Corporate carbon information disclosure","the global consensus","climate change"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Managerial Myopia":2.0,"Corporate Carbon Information Disclosure":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"China":2.0,"CID":2.0,"Corporate carbon information disclosure":1.0,"the global consensus":1.0,"climate change":1.0}},"age_hours":12.991667408055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8798,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0175,"sadness":0.0112,"fear":0.0441,"anger":0.0145,"disgust":0.0257},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the impact of managerial myopia on corporate carbon information disclosure (CID) in Chinese A-share-listed companies from 2010 to 2023.

Using a panel dataset of 2319 firm-year observations from 13 countries between 2013 and 2024, the analysis applies fixed-effects regression and robustness checks using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The findings show that environmental innovation significantly improves emissions performance, confirming its strategic role in achieving sustainability goals. Board gender diversity has a positive direct impact on emissions outcomes, suggesting that diverse boards enhance sustainability-oriented governance. However, the interaction term has a negative and significant effect, indicating that gender diversity, while beneficial overall, can weaken the link between environmental innovation and emission performance, possibly because of complex decision-making processes. This study contributes theoretically by extending the Resource-Based View and Porter Hypothesis to an under-researched context, while emphasizing the need for governance mechanisms that leverage diversity without slowing innovation implementation.

Furthermore, to address the operation optimization problem of the HCEH-IES, a deep reinforcement learning method based on Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) is proposed. This method can adaptively learn control strategies through interactions between the intelligent agent and the energy system, enabling continuous action control of the multi-energy flow system while solving the uncertainties associated with source-load fluctuations from wind power, photovoltaics, and multi-energy loads. Finally, historical data are used to train the intelligent body and compare the scheduling strategies obtained by SAC and DDPG algorithms. The results show that the SAC-based algorithm has better economics, is close to the CPLEX day-ahead optimal scheduling method, and is more suitable for solving the dynamic optimal scheduling problem of integrated energy systems in real scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9040","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:53:55.805214","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Xiaoying Yu","raw_content_length":1612,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Soft Actor–Critic"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1532,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Low","the background","dual-carbon","the development","energy internet","an inevitable trend","Chinas low-carbon energy transition","This paper"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["the development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Low":2.0,"the background":1.0,"dual-carbon":1.0,"the development":1.0,"energy internet":1.0,"an inevitable trend":1.0,"Chinas low-carbon energy transition":1.0,"This paper":1.0}},"age_hours":12.991698627777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.36,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.872,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9052,"joy":0.0526,"surprise":0.0181,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.003,"anger":0.0075,"disgust":0.0089},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a hydrogen-coupled electrothermal integrated energy system (HCEH-IES) and optimizes its source-side structure using carbon trading policy and low-carbon technology.

We found that, when averaged across all neurons, persistent delay activity was observable throughout the duration of single trials in populations of prefrontal neurons with silent periods that did not deviate significantly from chance. However, temporal fluctuations in activity-dependent mnemonic information were present and weakly correlated between the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting at least partial, long-distance synchronization of off-states. Decoding accuracy of neurons recorded simultaneously was also reduced relatively to pseudo-populations constructed by splicing different trials together.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6752d3e96030","title":"Role of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system in susceptibility and resilience following early life stress in male and female mice","content":"Background: Child adversity (CA), encompassing emotional, physical, and sexual maltreatment or abuse, affects a substantial number of children worldwide. Moreover, it is the leading predictor of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and suicidal behavior. Despite the robust link between CA and psychopathology, individual outcomes vary significantly, with some children demonstrating resilience. Resilience is an adaptive and dynamic process, which mitigates the long-term effects of CA, suggesting potential protective mechanisms that remain underexplored. This study investigates the role of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a critical modulator of stress, cognition, and emotion, in mediating resilience and susceptibility following early life stress (ELS). Methods: Using a maternal deprivation model combined with limited nesting and bedding, we examined behavioral, physiological, and neurobiological markers associated with ELS outcomes in mice of both sex. Results: Behavioral clustering revealed distinct phenotypes: resilient, anxious, and depressive-like with sex-specific differences in distribution. Early markers, including body weight and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) patterns, predicted long-term susceptibility. Neuroanatomical analyses identified sex-specific LC-NE activation patterns associated with resilience and susceptibility, highlighting the caudal-dorsal LC as a critical region in males and females in different phenotypes, anxious in males and resilient in females.

Poor theoretical and experimental control of variables that drive metaphor activation (particularly the constructs of novelty and familiarity) may be the reason for past discrepancies between studies. To address this issue, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and a carefully designed paradigm modified from Cardillo et al. (2012) to investigate how neural activation varies by sentence type (metaphorical versus literal sentences) and novelty (completely novel versus familiarized phrases). Activity was significantly greater for metaphorical over literal sentences in the left inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis (LIFGtri), left inferior parietal cortex, right IFG, pars opercularis (RIFGop), and right angular gyrus (RAG). Novel metaphors to which participants had no prior exposure had significantly higher (albeit weak) effects within RIFGop, RAG, and right middle temporal gyrus (RMTG) compared to novel metaphors to which participants were exposed just prior to the fNIRS experiment. Pre-exposed, more familiar metaphors significantly activated a wider network of regions compared to novel metaphors, including bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral IFGtri, and LMTG. A greater response time difference between conditions was associated with less LMFG activity for metaphors over literal sentences but higher LMTG activity for novel over more familiar metaphors. Taken together, these findings suggest that metaphors - particularly novel metaphors - do engage right hemisphere cortex more than other phrase types (literal sentences, more familiar metaphors) but that the effects are weaker than condition differences within canonical left language network and domain-general multiple demand network regions.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681881v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:54:49.485859","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Schwartz, A., Gilmore, N., Meier, E.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_5a952f842a3a","title":"A comprehensive characterization of the phospholipid and cholesterol composition of the uncinate fasciculus in the human brain: evidence of age","content":"The uncinate fasciculus (UF) is a long-range association fiber tract that serves to connect the anterior temporal lobe with the orbitofrontal cortex. The UF has been implicated via neuroimaging studies in the neurobiological vulnerability to psychiatric disorders posed by a history of childhood abuse (CA), as well as in the psychopathology underlying depressive disorders. Since the myelin sheath is highly enriched in lipids, white matter (WM) dysfunction may reflect alterations in the myelin lipid profile. In fact, our previous work showed that in the anterior cingulate cortex WM, there was a specific effect of CA in the choline glycerophospholipid fatty acids (FA) involved in the synthesis of arachidonic acid. Given that the UF does not exist in rodents, its molecular properties are highly understudied and its lipid composition is virtually unknown. As such, we sought to quantify the phospholipid FA and cholesterol quantities of the human postmortem UF and measure whether we could detect lipid-related or myelin-constituent gene/protein changes associated with CA and/or depression. Fresh-frozen left hemisphere UF samples were analyzed from individuals with depression who died by suicide with a history of severe CA (DS-CA), individuals with depression who died by suicide without a history of CA (DS), and non-psychiatric control subjects who died naturally or accidentally (CTRL). Phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography. FA and non-derivatized cholesterol were quantified using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Relative expression of myelin-constituent genes (PLP1, MAG, CNP, MOG, PLLP, MBP, and MOBP) was measured by RT-qPCR, and levels of myelin-constituent proteins (MAG, MOG, MBP, and PLP) were measured by immunoblotting. We found no robust relationships between depression or CA and any lipid measures, nor in myelin-constituent gene and protein levels. However, in the phospholipids, we observed striking age relationships that varied across fractions, with an overall pattern of increases in monounsaturates and decreases in long chain omega-6 polyunsaturates with age. In tandem, we observed that most myelin-constituent genes and proteins showed decreasing trends with age, with PLP1 and MAG showing significantly decreasing relationships. We hypothesize that the changes in lipid composition and lipid-protein interactions contribute to age-related myelin deficits and declines in cognition. The absence of group differences highlights the importance of regional specificity in molecular studies assessing neurobiological correlates of psychiatric disorders.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681536v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:54:49.486226","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":370,"author":"Perlman, K., Chen, C., Smith, M., Kim, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c1a21fc850bd","title":"A compressed code for memory discrimination","content":"The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli has been used as an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for the similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or \"separated.\" An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows the individual to efficiently retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation---a process linked to higher-order visual processing---without hindering discrimination. Under the compression hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserving more information about distinct stimulus dimensions. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. First, we train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, and measure lossiness of those representations using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, we find that greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, particularly in later layers of convolutional neural networks shown to predict brain activity in the higher-order visual stream. We then empirically confirm these predictions across two sets of images, four behavioral datasets, and alternative metrics of lossiness. Finally, using task fMRI data, we identify signatures of lossy compression---neural dimensionality reduction and information loss---in the higher-order visual stream regions V4 and IT as well as hippocampal subregions dentate gyrus/CA3 and CA1 associated with lure discrimination performance. These results suggest lossy compression may support mnemonic discrimination behavior by discarding redundant and overlapping information.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681901v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:54:49.486792","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":280,"author":"Zhou, D., Noh, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ae2062890a69","title":"Cell cycle oscillations in a polarity network facilitate state switching by morphogenetic cues","content":"The proper establishment of cell form, fate, and function during morphogenesis requires precise coordination between cell polarity and developmental cues. To achieve this, cells must establish polarity domains that are stable yet sensitive to guiding cues. Here we show that C. elegans germline blastomeres resolve this trade-off by creating a time-varying polarization landscape. Specifically, coupling the PAR polarity network to the cell-cycle kinase CDK-1 ensures that newborn cells operate in a low-feedback regime that lowers barriers to polarity state switching, allowing spatial cues to induce and orient PAR protein asymmetries. As CDK-1 activity rises at mitotic entry, increasing molecular feedback reinforces cue-induced asymmetries to yield robust and stable patterning of PAR domains. Consistent with this model, optogenetic and chemical perturbations show that low-CDK/low-feedback regimes destabilize PAR domains but are required for both de novo polarization and the reorientation of polarity in response to inductive cues. We propose that mitotic oscillations in cell polarity circuits dynamically optimize the polarization landscape to enable coordination of polarity with morphogenesis. Such temporal control of developmental networks is likely a general mechanism to balance robustness of cellular states with sensitivity to signal-induced state switching.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681824v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:54:49.487071","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Ng, K., Sebaa, H., Hirani, N., Chizh, A., Messi, Z., Bland, T., Sugioka, K., Goehring, N.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_189fedfc749d","title":"Tachykinin 1","content":"Evaluating outcomes to accurately predict which actions lead to reward is crucial for survival. Discrepancies between expected and realized outcomes, termed reward prediction errors, serve as a teaching signal to update subsequent predictions and promote adaptive behavior. Neural correlates of prediction errors have been identified in several brain regions, including the lateral habenula (LHb), which contains a subpopulation of neurons encoding negative RPEs (nRPEs) that are excited by worse-than-expected outcomes and inhibited by better-than-expected outcomes. LHb projections to the midbrain shape firing in dopaminergic neurons and play a well-established role in reward learning and decision-making. However, the LHb engages in a wide variety of behaviors beyond reward processing, and it remains unclear whether these distinct functions are mediated by specific transcriptionally defined cell types. Little is known about the transcriptomic identity of nRPE-encoding neurons, limiting our understanding of the specific role of these signals in outcome valuation. Using cell type-specific recording in mice performing reward-guided tasks, we demonstrate neurons expressing the neuropeptide gene Tachykinin-1 (Tac1) represent a subpopulation of LHb neurons encoding reward prediction errors. We found LHbTac1 reward outcome responses are sensitive to changes in both the expected value and realized value of rewards, and their activity scales with the magnitude of the difference. Further, LHbTac1 neurons show little modulation to other task-related events, or to innately aversive stimuli that engage a broader population of LHb cell types. Together, these data demonstrate that Tac1 marks a subpopulation of LHb neurons that preferentially encodes nRPE. Our results provide insight into cell type-specific contributions of habenular neurons in RPE signaling and open avenues for more targeted manipulations of nRPE-encoding neurons to understand their role in reward-guided behavior.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.680558v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:54:49.487390","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","life-sciences","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":276,"author":"Suzuki, K.

Despite its significant role in disease transmission, genomic data for this species remain limited. Here, we present the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of D. reticulatus, constructed using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data. Methods High molecular weight DNA was extracted from a female Dermacentor reticulatus collected in Devon, UK, and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore long-read technology. Genome assemblies were generated using both guided and unguided approaches, followed by repeat masking, gene prediction, and functional annotation. Genome completeness was assessed using BUSCO, and comparative, phylogenetic, and functional analyses were performed against other Dermacentor and tick species. Results This chromosome-scale genome assembly revealed a repeat-rich genome, with approximately 61.9% of the total sequence consisting of repetitive elements. Benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO) analysis demonstrated strong genome completeness, with guided assembly (chromosome) achieving a score of 97.1%, closely matching those of related Dermacentor species. For comparison, unguided assembly (scaffold) yielded a BUSCO score of 96.7%. Gene annotation following repeat masking resulted in BUSCO completeness scores of 95.1% (guided) and 95.0% (unguided). Functional characterisation included Pfam domain assignment and Gene Ontology analysis. Additionally, we assembled the mitochondrial genome (15,103 bp), comprising 38 genes, providing further insight into D. reticulatus phylogenetic placement.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_09f60e3b72c5","title":"We launched an AI agent and it flopped. Here’s what we learned—and why we’re trying again","content":"In September 2023, we thought we had done something revolutionary. Helios AI became the first company in our industry to launch a generative AI agent. We called her Cersi. She was designed to help food companies understand the climate risks threatening their agricultural supply chains. She was powerful, intuitive, years ahead of the curve—and almost completely ignored. At the time, ChatGPT had just exploded onto the scene, and the hype around AI was deafening. Headlines promised that AI would transform every corner of business. Venture capital poured into the sector. But hype doesn’t always translate into real-world use—especially in industries that aren’t built to adopt change quickly. Food procurement, where billion-dollar decisions hinge on weather patterns and multiyear contracts, not to mention generational relationships and personal rolodexes, is one of those industries. In a space where legacy companies tout decades of experience, newness isn’t always a boon. We assumed that if we built something technically advanced, adoption would follow. We were wrong. Why our first AI agent failed Cersi was conceived as a conversational assistant. Type a question about your supply chain into a chat box, and she would pull from Helios’s massive dataset to provide a rich, insightful answer. It sounded futuristic, and on technical merit, it worked. But the glaring problem was, it didn’t fit the way our customers actually worked. First, they didn’t want to “chat.” Procurement executives, commodity traders, and risk managers wanted structured, decision-ready insights. They wanted something they could paste into a slide deck for the CFO, or drop into an email to their sourcing team. A conversational AI, however clever or time-saving, wasn’t the format they needed. Second, most users kept asking the same five questions again and again. That told us something important: their needs weren’t open-ended. They wanted repeatable analysis, standardized for their business, not a new way to brainstorm with an algorithm. Finally, and perhaps most critically, Cersi sometimes produced answers that were technically correct but felt superficial. In an industry where credibility and precision matter, “close enough” wasn’t good enough. What we learned The biggest lesson was simple but humbling: AI itself isn’t the product—the outcome is. In other words, customers don’t care how elegant your models are. They care if your product saves them time, reduces their risk, or helps them make a better decision in a high-stakes environment. We had fallen into the classic founder trap of building something because we could, not because our customers had asked for it. But we had still built something exceptional and groundbreaking in its industry, beyond what the standard benchmarks in the field were capable of. So a few months after Cersi’s underwhelming debut, we reimagined her role. Instead of a front-end chatbot, she became a behind-the-scenes analyst. Rather than flowing conversation, she was rebuilt to generate thousands of custom agricultural reports every month—each tailored to a customer’s commodities, sourcing regions, and climate risks. These reports would land directly in a customer’s inbox or workflow, in the format they need, where they can actually use them. In shifting Cersi from a “face” to a “function,” adoption skyrocketed. The AI didn’t become less powerful, it just became better integrated. In making our AI less visible, it became much more useful. As the saying goes, good design should be invisible. Building on that success, last month, almost two years after Cersi’s flop, we launched Helios Horizon, the first multi-agent platform in our industry. It’s designed to handle complex, interconnected tasks that a single agent couldn’t. Instead of one assistant, Horizon uses a coordinated set of AI agents that monitor risks, flag disruptions, and deliver analysis specific to each customer’s supply chain. This level of advanced AI would’ve been hard to imagine back in 2023, but we’d taken our lessons from Cersi to heart.The next wave of AI adoption will look different from the hype cycle of 2023. Enterprises aren’t asking whether AI is possible anymore. They’re asking if it’s practical, trustworthy, and built to fit their workflows. And those are harder questions to answer. 3 takeaways for Founders 1. Great AI isn’t enough The technology has to map directly to real workflows and be right-sized for the industry it serves. In 2023, most of our customers had barely used a chatbot, and they weren’t ready to experiment with one in their jobs. Today, after nearly two years of ChatGPT in the mainstream, familiarity is higher. We no longer have to teach people what a natural-language interface is—but we still have to prove why it matters in their world. 2. Users don’t want AI—they want its benefits Our customers don’t wake up excited to “use AI.” They wake up trying to secure coffee from Brazil or wheat from Kansas before climate shocks, trade restrictions, or shipping delays throw their budgets into chaos. What matters most is the outcome: did the system save them hours of manual analysis? Did it prevent a costly mistake? That’s why one of Horizon’s most popular features is simple: it shows customers how many hours we’ve saved them. Time is a currency they value even more than insights. 3. The best AI isn’t visible The future of AI in the enterprise isn’t necessarily chatbots or flashy dashboards. Often, the most valuable AI disappears into the background, quietly doing the work and surfacing results at the right time, in the right format. Cersi failing taught us that “quieter AI” can be more powerful than any buzzy avatar, co-pilot, or assistant. Horizon was built with that in mind. For founders building in this space, the lesson we learned is clear: resist the temptation to build AI for the hype cycle. In fact, do the very opposite—build your AI not to be the flashy new thing, but to be so good that it becomes invisible.","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91414267/we-launched-an-ai-agent-and-it-flopped-heres-why-were-trying-again-and-what-we-learned_ai-agent-failure-lessons-learned","published_date":"2025-10-13T10:28:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T12:56:33.318011","language":"en","tags":["technology","leadership","innovation","business"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":963,"author":"Francisco Martin-Rayo","raw_content_length":6564,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":4.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["billion-dollar"]},"char_count":6001,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["an AI agent","what","She","September","something","Helios AI","the first company","our industry","a generative AI agent","her Cersi"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["an AI agent"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"an AI agent":2.0,"what":2.0,"She":2.0,"September":1.0,"something":1.0,"Helios AI":1.0,"the first company":1.0,"our industry":1.0,"a generative AI agent":1.0,"her Cersi":1.0}},"age_hours":2.5337789483333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.971,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2058,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.176,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.528,"sadness":0.0156,"fear":0.1025,"anger":0.1351,"disgust":0.0374},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the deployment of an AI agent (Cersi) to help food companies understand climate risks in their supply chains.
