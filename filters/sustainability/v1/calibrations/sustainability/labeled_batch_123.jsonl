This limits higher-resolution transient climate simulations with current computational resources. ESMs like NASA GISS-ModelE3 (ModelE) often use pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition concentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs. While NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time feedback between aerosols and other climate processes by relying on pre-calculated fields. We extended the ModelE NINT version using machine learning (ML) to create Smart NINT, which emulates interactive emissions. Smart NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions and meteorological data as inputs, avoiding full physics parameterizations. Our approach utilizes a spatiotemporal architecture that possesses a well-matched inductive bias to effectively capture the spatial and temporal dependencies in tracer evolution. Input data processed through the first 20 vertical levels (from the surface up to 656 hPa) using the ModelE OMA scheme. This vertical range covers nearly the entire BCB concentration distribution in the troposphere, where significant variation on short time horizons due to surface-level emissions is observed. Our evaluation shows excellent model performance with R-squared values of 0.92 and Pearson-r of 0.96 at the first pressure level. This high performance continues through level 15 (808.5 hPa), then gradually decreases as BCB concentrations drop significantly. The model maintains acceptable performance even when tested on data from entirely different periods outside the training domain, which is a crucial capability for climate modeling applications requiring reliable long-term projections.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10654","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.045673","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","physicsao-ph","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Seyed Mohammad Hassan Erfani, Kara Lamb, Susanne Bauer, Kostas Tsigaridis, Marcus van Lier-Walqui, Gavin Schmidt","raw_content_length":1930,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NASA","NINT","Smart NINT","Interactive Atmospheric Composition Emulation","Earth System Models","Non-Interactive Tracers"],"persons":["Smart NINT"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1929,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Interactive Atmospheric Composition Emulation","ESMs","arXiv251010654v1","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Interactive composition simulations","Earth System Models","tracers","each timestep"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Interactive Atmospheric Composition Emulation":2.0,"ESMs":2.0,"arXiv251010654v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Interactive composition simulations":1.0,"Earth System Models":1.0,"tracers":1.0,"each timestep":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761667581111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8564,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0425,"sadness":0.035,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0286,"disgust":0.0242},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a machine learning approach (Smart NINT) to emulate interactive emissions in Earth System Models, aiming to reduce computational costs and improve the accuracy of climate simulations.

While second-order methods can significantly accelerate convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and Hessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\\in (1,2]$, and establish tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed regimes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10690","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.046064","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","mathoc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Abdurakhmon Sadiev, Peter Richt\\'arik, Ilyas Fatkhullin","raw_content_length":1418,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["some $p\\in"]},"char_count":1417,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Heavy-tailed noise","modern machine learning applications","data heterogeneity","outliers","non-stationary stochastic environments","second-order methods","convergence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Heavy-tailed noise","modern machine learning applications"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Heavy-tailed noise":1.0,"modern machine learning applications":1.0,"data heterogeneity":1.0,"outliers":1.0,"non-stationary stochastic environments":1.0,"second-order methods":1.0,"convergence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761682613611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.008,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5984,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5957,"joy":0.0075,"surprise":0.0186,"sadness":0.0209,"fear":0.2266,"anger":0.065,"disgust":0.0657},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical advancements in second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise, which is relevant to machine learning applications.

As a particular case, our results transfer previous work by P. Bianchi on that method in Hilbert spaces for the first time to Hadamard manifolds. Moreover, our convergence proof is fully effective and allows for the construction of explicit rates of convergence for the iteration towards the (unique) solution both in mean and almost surely. These rates are moreover highly uniform, being independent of most data surrounding the iteration, space or distribution. In that generality, these rates are novel already in the context of Hilbert spaces.

We introduce HYPERDOA, a novel estimator leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). The framework introduces two distinct feature extraction strategies -- Mean Spatial-Lag Autocorrelation and Spatial Smoothing -- for its HDC pipeline, and then reframes DoA estimation as a pattern recognition problem. This approach leverages HDC's inherent robustness to noise and its transparent algebraic operations to bypass the expensive matrix decompositions and ``black-box'' nature of classical and deep learning methods, respectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that HYPERDOA achieves ~35.39% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in low-SNR, coherent-source scenarios. Crucially, it also consumes ~93% less energy than competing neural baselines on an embedded NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX platform.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2117d539000a","title":"How Patterns Dictate Learnability in Sequential Data","content":"arXiv:2510.10744v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language - has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the data.

We present an optimization model that computes bids for both arbitrage and frequency regulation and ensures that storage operators can honor their market commitments at all times for all fluctuation signals in an uncertainty set inspired by market rules. This requirement, initially expressed by an infinite number of nonconvex functional constraints, is shown to be equivalent to a finite number of deterministic constraints. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer bilinear program that admits mixed-integer linear relaxations and restrictions. Empirical tests on European electricity markets show a negligible optimality gap between the relaxation and the restriction. The model can account for intraday trading and, with a solution time of under 5 seconds, may serve as a building block for more complex trading strategies. Such strategies become necessary as battery capacity exceeds the demand for ancillary services.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_15b43b81e2b7","title":"Quantifying Dataset Similarity to Guide Transfer Learning","content":"arXiv:2510.10866v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Transfer learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, as it can empower models by leveraging knowledge from related domains to improve learning effectiveness. However, transferring from poorly aligned data can harm rather than help performance, making it crucial to determine whether the transfer will be beneficial before implementation. This work aims to address this challenge by proposing an innovative metric to measure dataset similarity and provide quantitative guidance on transferability. In the literature, existing methods largely focus on feature distributions while overlooking label information and predictive relationships, potentially missing critical transferability insights. In contrast, our proposed metric, the Cross-Learning Score (CLS), measures dataset similarity through bidirectional generalization performance between domains. We provide a theoretical justification for CLS by establishing its connection to the cosine similarity between the decision boundaries for the target and source datasets. Computationally, CLS is efficient and fast to compute as it bypasses the problem of expensive distribution estimation for high-dimensional problems. We further introduce a general framework that categorizes source datasets into positive, ambiguous, or negative transfer zones based on their CLS relative to the baseline error, enabling informed decisions. Additionally, we extend this approach to encoder-head architectures in deep learning to better reflect modern transfer pipelines. Extensive experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world tasks demonstrate that CLS can reliably predict whether transfer will improve or degrade performance, offering a principled tool for guiding data selection in transfer learning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10866","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.050179","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Shudong Sun, Hao Helen Zhang","raw_content_length":1814,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Cross-Learning Score"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1813,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantifying Dataset Similarity","Transfer Learning","arXiv251010866v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Transfer learning","a cornerstone","modern machine learning","models","knowledge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["modern machine learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantifying Dataset Similarity":2.0,"Transfer Learning":2.0,"arXiv251010866v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Transfer learning":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0,"modern machine learning":1.0,"models":1.0,"knowledge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7618289580555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.285,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.657,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8667,"joy":0.0223,"surprise":0.0089,"sadness":0.0183,"fear":0.0458,"anger":0.0219,"disgust":0.0161},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a metric (CLS) to improve transfer learning, potentially reducing the computational resources needed for machine learning tasks.

We propose a method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF. Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance of RF in some situations.

We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors.

Even for the classic $GI/GI/n$ queue with homogeneous servers, it is highly non-trivial to derive a simple and accurate bound for the steady-state queue length that holds across all scaling regimes. A recent breakthrough by Li and Goldberg (2025) establishes bounds that scale as $1/(1-\\rho)$ for any load $\\rho < 1$ and number of servers $n$, which is the correct scaling in many well-known scaling regimes, including classic heavy-traffic, Halfin-Whitt and Nondegenerate-Slowdown. However, their bounds entail large constant factors and a highly intricate proof, suggesting room for further improvement. In this paper, we present a new $1/(1-\\rho)$-scaling bound for the $GI/GI/n$ queue.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0ac0782e5c69","title":"Assessing the Role of Communication in Modular Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.11053v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The scalability of quantum computing is constrained by the physical and architectural limitations of monolithic quantum processors. Modular multi-core quantum architectures, which interconnect multiple quantum cores (QCs) via classical and quantum-coherent links, offer a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, transitioning to a modular architecture introduces communication overhead, where classical communication plays a crucial role in executing quantum algorithms by transmitting measurement outcomes and synchronizing operations across QCs. Understanding the impact of classical communication on execution time is therefore essential for optimizing system performance. In this work, we introduce \\qcomm, an open-source simulator designed to evaluate the role of classical communication in modular quantum computing architectures. \\qcomm{} provides a high-level execution and timing model that captures the interplay between quantum gate execution, entanglement distribution, teleportation protocols, and classical communication latency. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis to quantify the impact of classical communication bandwidth, interconnect types, and quantum circuit mapping strategies on overall execution time. Furthermore, we assess classical communication overhead when executing real quantum benchmarks mapped onto a cryogenically-controlled multi-core quantum system. Our results show that, while classical communication is generally not the dominant contributor to execution time, its impact becomes increasingly relevant in optimized scenarios -- such as improved quantum technology, large-scale interconnects, or communication-aware circuit mappings. These findings provide useful insights for the design of scalable modular quantum architectures and highlight the importance of evaluating classical communication as a performance-limiting factor in future systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11053","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.053928","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","cset","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Maurizio Palesi, Enrico Russo, Giuseppe Ascia, Hamaad Rafique, Davide Patti, Vincenzo Catania, Sergi Abadal, Abhijit Das, Pau Escofet, Eduard Alarcon, Carmen G.

Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first, sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the M\\\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG MLPs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11148","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.054744","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","physicscomp-ph","preprints","physicschem-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Weilong Chen, Franz G\\\"orlich, Paul Fuchs, Julija Zavadlav","raw_content_length":1427,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PMF","Efficient Learning of"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1426,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Enhanced Sampling","Efficient Learning","Coarse","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Coarse-graining CG","molecular dynamics MD simulations","larger systems","longer timescales"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Coarse-graining CG"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Enhanced Sampling":2.0,"Efficient Learning":2.0,"Coarse":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Coarse-graining CG":1.0,"molecular dynamics MD simulations":1.0,"larger systems":1.0,"longer timescales":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761996946388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9431,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0291,"sadness":0.0026,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.0077,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel method for improving the efficiency of molecular dynamics simulations, which could potentially lead to better design of materials with climate-relevant properties.

The convolutional neural network applies energy conservation through physics-based loss functions, which operate on normalized fields per channel. Monte Carlo dropout provides uncertainty measurement. The hybrid model produces precise predictions with coefficient of determination (R^2) values above 0.95 and mean squared errors below 10^-4 for all field components.

CSI prediction, which forecasts future CSI from historical observations, offers a promising solution. Recent deep learning approaches, including recurrent neural networks and Transformers, have achieved notable success but typically learn deterministic mappings, limiting their ability to capture the stochastic and multimodal nature of wireless channels. In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for CSI prediction based on diffusion models, offering a flexible design that supports integration of diverse prediction schemes. We decompose the CSI prediction task into two components: a temporal encoder, which extracts channel dynamics, and a diffusion-based generator, which produces future CSI samples.

This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds, planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m, while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in mega-constellations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11242","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.057580","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","astro-phep","preprints","research","astro-phim","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Katarina Dyreby, Francisco Caldas, Cl\\'audia Soares","raw_content_length":1709,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Starlink","LEO","Analyzing Data Quality"],"persons":["Decay"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1708,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Data Quality","Decay","Mega","arXiv251011242v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","the era","mega","constellations","the need"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Data Quality":2.0,"Decay":2.0,"Mega":2.0,"arXiv251011242v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the era":1.0,"mega":1.0,"constellations":1.0,"the need":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7621006625,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8654,"joy":0.0213,"surprise":0.0334,"sadness":0.0092,"fear":0.0154,"anger":0.0336,"disgust":0.0218},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the accuracy of publicly available data on Starlink satellites, focusing on deorbiting behavior.

In this work, we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development, assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms. The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling, calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that could affect the comparability of different approaches. As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation, and gather feedback.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6508e3cb007d","title":"CIRSense: Rethinking WiFi Sensing with Channel Impulse Response","content":"arXiv:2510.11374v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: WiFi sensing based on channel state information (CSI) collected from commodity WiFi devices has shown great potential across a wide range of applications, including vital sign monitoring and indoor localization. Existing WiFi sensing approaches typically estimate motion information directly from CSI. However, they often overlook the inherent advantages of channel impulse response (CIR), a delay-domain representation that enables more intuitive and principled motion sensing by naturally concentrating motion energy and separating multipath components. Motivated by this, we revisit WiFi sensing and introduce CIRSense, a new framework that enhances the performance and interpretability of WiFi sensing with CIR. CIRSense is built upon a new motion model that characterizes fractional delay effects, a fundamental challenge in CIR-based sensing. This theoretical model underpins technical advances for the three challenges in WiFi sensing: hardware distortion compensation, high-resolution distance estimation, and subcarrier aggregation for extended range sensing. CIRSense, operating with a 160 MHz channel bandwidth, demonstrates versatile sensing capabilities through its dual-mode design, achieving a mean error of approximately 0.25 bpm in respiration monitoring and 0.09 m in distance estimation. Comprehensive evaluations across residential spaces, far-range scenarios, and multi-target settings demonstrate CIRSense's superior performance over state-of-the-art CSI-based baselines. Notably, at a challenging sensing distance of 20 m, CIRSense achieves at least 3x higher average accuracy with more than 4.5x higher computational efficiency.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11374","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.059569","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","csni","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Ruiqi Kong, He Chen","raw_content_length":1703,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Channel Impulse Response arXiv:2510.11374v1 Announce Type:","CIR","CIRSense","CSI"],"persons":["Rethinking WiFi","WiFi"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1702,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CIRSense","Channel Impulse Response","CSI","arXiv251011374v1","Announce Type","Abstract","WiFi sensing","channel state information","commodity WiFi devices","great potential"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CIRSense":2.0,"Channel Impulse Response":2.0,"CSI":2.0,"arXiv251011374v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"WiFi sensing":1.0,"channel state information":1.0,"commodity WiFi devices":1.0,"great potential":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7621706436111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9242,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.044,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0104,"disgust":0.0033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new WiFi sensing framework (CIRSense) that improves accuracy and efficiency in motion sensing.

But real life also pushes human intelligence along a different frontier, requiring people to flexibly navigate decision-making problems that they have never thought about before. Here, we use novice gameplay to study how people make decisions and form judgments in new problem settings. We show that people are systematic and adaptively rational in how they play a game for the first time, or evaluate a game (e.g., how fair or how fun it is likely to be) before they have played it even once. We explain these capacities via a computational cognitive model that we call the \"Intuitive Gamer\". The model is based on mechanisms of fast and flat (depth-limited) goal-directed probabilistic simulation--analogous to those used in Monte Carlo tree-search models of expert game-play, but scaled down to use very few stochastic samples, simple goal heuristics for evaluating actions, and no deep search. In a series of large-scale behavioral studies with over 1000 participants and 121 two-player strategic board games (almost all novel to our participants), our model quantitatively captures human judgments and decisions varying the amount and kind of experience people have with a game--from no experience at all (\"just thinking\"), to a single round of play, to indirect experience watching another person and predicting how they should play--and does so significantly better than much more compute-intensive expert-level models. More broadly, our work offers new insights into how people rapidly evaluate, act, and make suggestions when encountering novel problems, and could inform the design of more flexible and human-like AI systems that can determine not just how to solve new tasks, but whether a task is worth thinking about at all.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11503","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.060422","language":"en","tags":["csai","preprints","csgt","q-bionc","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":304,"author":"Katherine M.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a6dc43c0112a","title":"Toward Efficient and Privacy","content":"arXiv:2510.11514v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Real-time and contactless monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heartbeat, alongside reliable communication, is essential for modern healthcare systems, especially in remote and privacy-sensitive environments. Traditional wireless communication and sensing networks fall short in meeting all the stringent demands of eHealth, including accurate sensing, high data efficiency, and privacy preservation. To overcome the challenges, we propose a novel integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) framework. In the proposed system, a service robot utilises radar to detect patient positions and monitor their vital signs, while sending updates to the medical devices. Instead of transmitting raw physiological information, the robot computes and communicates semantically extracted health features to medical devices. This semantic processing improves data throughput and preserves the clinical relevance of the messages, while enhancing data privacy by avoiding the transmission of sensitive data. Leveraging the estimated patient locations, the robot employs an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter to actively track patient motion, thereby enabling robust beam steering for continuous and reliable monitoring. We then propose a joint optimisation of the beamforming matrices and the semantic extraction ratio, subject to computing capability and power budget constraints, with the objective of maximising both the semantic secrecy rate and sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate that the ISCSC framework achieves superior sensing accuracy, improved semantic transmission efficiency, and enhanced privacy preservation compared to conventional joint sensing and communication methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11514","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.060905","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","research","mathit","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Yinchao Yang, Yahao Ding, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Mohammad Shikh-Bahaei","raw_content_length":1777,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.165,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ISCSC","eHealth"],"persons":["Toward Efficient"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1776,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Efficient","Privacy","arXiv251011514v1","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Real-time","contactless monitoring","vital signs","respiration"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Efficient":2.0,"Privacy":2.0,"arXiv251011514v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Real-time":1.0,"contactless monitoring":1.0,"vital signs":1.0,"respiration":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7622171633333332,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.864,"joy":0.0211,"surprise":0.0134,"sadness":0.0112,"fear":0.048,"anger":0.0314,"disgust":0.011},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel ISCSC framework for remote patient monitoring.

Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically, especially when simple beamforming strategies are employed. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11582","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.062457","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","research","mathit","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Renato Luis Garrido Cavalcante, Noor Ul Ain, Lorenzo Miretti, Slawomir Stanczak","raw_content_length":1208,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CSI"],"persons":["max","MIMO"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1207,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Use","arXiv251011582v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","mathematical tools","fixed point algorithms","optimal statistical max-min power control","cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems","previous studies","the use-and-then-forget UatF"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["fixed point algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Use":2.0,"arXiv251011582v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"mathematical tools":1.0,"fixed point algorithms":1.0,"optimal statistical max-min power control":1.0,"cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems":1.0,"previous studies":1.0,"the use-and-then-forget UatF":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762277679166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.062000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6124,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9077,"joy":0.0187,"surprise":0.0529,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0093,"disgust":0.0028},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a mathematical framework for optimizing power control in cellular systems, potentially leading to more efficient use of energy in wireless communication.

Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based decoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of QEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and general decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of stabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our architecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of stabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations to build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves substantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a dedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across various code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural network-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline.

Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute and chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we establish a hybrid G&R framework in which we integrate a mixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This multi-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype of eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left ventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&R.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11670","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.063293","language":"en","tags":["preprints","q-bioto","physicsmed-ph","csna","research","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Ludovica Maga, Mathias Peirlinck, Lise No\\\"el","raw_content_length":1628,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["G&R"],"persons":["Collagen","myocyte growth alone","Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1615,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the interplay","collagen","myocyte adaptation","cardiac volume overload","a multi","Announce Type","cross","Hearts","volume overload","detrimental anatomical and functional changes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the interplay":2.0,"collagen":2.0,"myocyte adaptation":2.0,"cardiac volume overload":2.0,"a multi":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Hearts":1.0,"volume overload":1.0,"detrimental anatomical and functional changes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7623079049999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4797,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0922,"sadness":0.1984,"fear":0.1646,"anger":0.0207,"disgust":0.0349},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical framework for understanding cardiac remodeling.

Attacks are more effective when the disinformation is spread across several agents than when the disinformation is concentrated with more intensity on fewer agents.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_bcd41782ad72","title":"Learning to Be Cautious","content":"arXiv:2110.15907v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A key challenge in the field of reinforcement learning is to develop agents that behave cautiously in novel situations. It is generally impossible to anticipate all situations that an autonomous system may face or what behavior would best avoid bad outcomes. An agent that can learn to be cautious would overcome this challenge by discovering for itself when and how to behave cautiously. In contrast, current approaches typically embed task-specific safety information or explicit cautious behaviors into the system, which is error-prone and imposes extra burdens on practitioners. In this paper, we present both a sequence of tasks where cautious behavior becomes increasingly non-obvious, as well as an algorithm to demonstrate that it is possible for a system to learn to be cautious. The essential features of our algorithm are that it characterizes reward function uncertainty without task-specific safety information and uses this uncertainty to construct a robust policy. Specifically, we construct robust policies with a k-of-N counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) subroutine given learned reward function uncertainty represented by a neural network ensemble. These policies exhibit caution in each of our tasks without any task-specific safety tuning.

Analogously to memory protection, Ge et al. have proposed time protection for preventing information leakage via timing channels. They also showed that time protection calls for hardware support. This work leverages the open and extensible RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) to introduce the temporal fence instruction fence.t, which provides the required mechanisms by clearing vulnerable microarchitectural state and guaranteeing a history-independent context-switch latency. We propose and discuss three different implementations of fence.t and implement them on an experimental version of the seL4 microkernel and CVA6, an open-source, in-order, application class, 64-bit RISC-V core.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d0b0ad3d6182","title":"Invariant Feature Learning for Generalized Long","content":"arXiv:2207.09504v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Existing long-tailed classification (LT) methods only focus on tackling the class-wise imbalance that head classes have more samples than tail classes, but overlook the attribute-wise imbalance. In fact, even if the class is balanced, samples within each class may still be long-tailed due to the varying attributes. Note that the latter is fundamentally more ubiquitous and challenging than the former because attributes are not just implicit for most datasets, but also combinatorially complex, thus prohibitively expensive to be balanced. Therefore, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Long-Tailed classification (GLT), to jointly consider both kinds of imbalances. By \"generalized\", we mean that a GLT method should naturally solve the traditional LT, but not vice versa. Not surprisingly, we find that most class-wise LT methods degenerate in our proposed two benchmarks: ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT. We argue that it is because they over-emphasize the adjustment of class distribution while neglecting to learn attribute-invariant features. To this end, we propose an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) method as the first strong baseline for GLT. IFL first discovers environments with divergent intra-class distributions from the imperfect predictions and then learns invariant features across them. Promisingly, as an improved feature backbone, IFL boosts all the LT line-up: one/two-stage re-balance, augmentation, and ensemble.

If the context in every class is evenly distributed, OOD would be trivial because the context can be easily removed due to an underlying principle: class is invariant to context. However, collecting such a balanced dataset is impractical. Learning on imbalanced data makes the model bias to context and thus hurts OOD. Therefore, the key to OOD is context balance. We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context bias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction, renders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled) as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels). We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes. On benchmarks with various context biases and domain gaps, we show that a simple re-weighting based classifier equipped with our context estimation achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Algebraically, closure is the cancellation of boundaries ($\\partial^2=0$), which converts transient histories into stable invariants. Building on this, we derive the \\emph{Structure-Before-Specificity} (SbS) principle: stable information resides in nontrivial homology classes that persist under perturbations, while high-entropy contextual details act as scaffolds. The \\emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP) quantifies this balance by decomposing uncertainty into contextual spread and content precision, showing why prediction requires invariance for generalization. Measure concentration onto residual invariant manifolds explains \\emph{order invariance}: when mass collapses to a narrow tube around a closed cycle, reparameterizations of micro-steps leave predictive functionals unchanged. We then define \\emph{homological capacity}, the topological dual of Shannon capacity, as the sustainable number of independent informational cycles supported by a system. This capacity links dynamical (KS) entropy to structural (homological) capacity and refines Euler characteristics from a ``net'' summary to a ``gross'' count of persistent invariants. Finally, we illustrate the theory across three domains where \\emph{more is different}: \\textbf{visual binding}, \\textbf{working memory}, and \\textbf{access consciousness}.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_540c6586be14","title":"Meta","content":"arXiv:2301.13247v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Loss function learning is a new meta-learning paradigm that aims to automate the essential task of designing a loss function for a machine learning model. Existing techniques for loss function learning have shown promising results, often improving a model's training dynamics and final inference performance. However, a significant limitation of these techniques is that the loss functions are meta-learned in an offline fashion, where the meta-objective only considers the very first few steps of training, which is a significantly shorter time horizon than the one typically used for training deep neural networks.

To address this issue we propose a new loss function learning technique for adaptively updating the loss function online after each update to the base model parameters.

Nevertheless, the recent development of wireless technologies and the spurt of deep learning (DL) techniques allow us to reclaim the meaning/usefulness aspect in the design of future 6G communication paradigms, where goal-oriented communication is becoming a trend. Age of Information (AoI), a well-known metric that captures the importance of information by recording the time elapsed from the generation time slot, has been extended to various variants, such as Value of Information (VoI), Urgency of Information (UoI), Age of Incorrect Information (AoII), and etc. While each of them proposes novel ways to measure the meaning/usefulness aspect of information, there is not yet an integrated framework encompassing all of them. To this end, we propose a novel tensor-based approach, the Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT), to unify them, which also allows more flexible and fine-grained goal characterizations. Following the proposed GoT, we architect a holistic goal-oriented framework to enable goal-oriented semantic communications, in which information perception, dissemination, and control-plane decisions are implemented in accordance with specific goals. Finally, we outline several open challenges to fulfill the vision of the GoT framework.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00848","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.068195","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","mathit","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Aimin Li, Shaohua Wu, Siqi Meng, Rongxing Lu, Sumei Sun, Qinyu Zhang","raw_content_length":1592,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.09,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AoI","Urgency of Information (UoI","Value of Information"],"persons":["Goal arXiv:2304.00848v3"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1591,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Goal","which","Announce Type","Shannons pioneering masterpiece","the prototype","modern information theory","the goal","communications","accurate message reconstruction","bit"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Goal":2.0,"which":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Shannons pioneering masterpiece":1.0,"the prototype":1.0,"modern information theory":1.0,"the goal":1.0,"communications":1.0,"accurate message reconstruction":1.0,"bit":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762482721944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8721,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0074,"sadness":0.0072,"fear":0.0342,"anger":0.0341,"disgust":0.0348},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a theoretical framework (GoT) for goal-oriented semantic communications in 6G, aiming to improve information efficiency.

However, Java applications running in untrusted clouds are vulnerable to various forms of privileged attacks. The emergence of trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX mitigates this problem. TEEs protect code and data in secure enclaves inaccessible to untrusted software, including the kernel and hypervisors. To efficiently use TEEs, developers must manually partition their applications into trusted and untrusted parts, in order to reduce the size of the trusted computing base (TCB) and minimise the risks of security vulnerabilities. However, partitioning applications poses two important challenges: (i) ensuring efficient object communication between the partitioned components, and (ii) ensuring the consistency of garbage collection between the parts, especially with memory-managed languages such as Java. We present Montsalvat, a tool which provides a practical and intuitive annotation-based partitioning approach for Java applications destined for secure enclaves. Montsalvat provides an RMI-like mechanism to ensure inter-object communication, as well as consistent garbage collection across the partitioned components. We implement Montsalvat with GraalVM native-image, a tool for compiling Java applications ahead-of-time into standalone native executables that do not require a JVM at runtime.

But the context-free matching process and the limited coverage of knowledge bases introduce inaccurate and incomplete annotation noise respectively. Previous studies either considered only incomplete annotation noise or indiscriminately handle two types of noise with the same strategy. In this paper, we argue that the different causes of two types of noise bring up the requirement of different strategies in model architecture. Therefore, we propose the SANTA to handle these two types of noise separately with (1) Memory-smoothed Focal Loss and Entity-aware KNN to relieve the entity ambiguity problem caused by inaccurate annotation, and (2) Boundary Mixup to alleviate decision boundary shifting problem caused by incomplete annotation and a noise-tolerant loss to improve the robustness.

The primary existing defense against these attacks is to preprocess potentially malicious text inputs using optical character recognition (OCR). In theory, OCR models will ignore any malicious Unicode characters and will extract the visually correct input to be fed to the model. In this work, we show that these visual defenses fail to prevent this type of attack. We use a genetic algorithm to generate visual adversarial examples (i.e., OCR outputs) in a black-box setting, demonstrating a highly effective novel attack that substantially reduces the accuracy of OCR and other visual models. Specifically, we use the Unicode functionality of combining characters (e.g., \\~n which combines the characters n and ~) to manipulate text inputs so that small visual perturbations appear when the text is displayed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks in the real world by creating adversarial examples against production models published by Meta, Microsoft, IBM, and Google. We additionally conduct a user study to establish that the model-fooling adversarial examples do not affect human comprehension of the text, showing that language models are uniquely vulnerable to this type of text attack.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07033","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.070198","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Nicholas Boucher, Jenny Blessing, Ilia Shumailov, Ross Anderson, Nicolas Papernot","raw_content_length":1456,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Unicode","OCR","ViT","OCR arXiv:2306.07033v2 Announce Type:"],"persons":[],"locations":["Unicode"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1455,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["OCR","Vision","ViT","Announce Type","Abstract","Text-based machine learning models","an emerging class","Unicode-based adversarial examples","a model","misreading text"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Vision","Text-based machine learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"OCR":3.0,"Vision":2.0,"ViT":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Text-based machine learning models":1.0,"an emerging class":1.0,"Unicode-based adversarial examples":1.0,"a model":1.0,"misreading text":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7625572925,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.3915000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9217,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1559,"joy":0.0031,"surprise":0.0033,"sadness":0.0345,"fear":0.5044,"anger":0.1922,"disgust":0.1066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies vulnerabilities in OCR systems used to defend against adversarial text attacks.

We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes.

Specifically, we use a camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06701","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.071381","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Haichao Zhang, Can Qin, Yu Yin, Yun Fu","raw_content_length":1254,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1253,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Camouflaged Image Synthesis","All","You","Camouflaged Detection","natural scenes","Announce Type","Abstract","that blend","significant challenges","deep-learning models"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Camouflaged Image Synthesis":2.0,"All":2.0,"You":2.0,"Camouflaged Detection":2.0,"natural scenes":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"that blend":1.0,"significant challenges":1.0,"deep-learning models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7626029605555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9096,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0184,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.0329,"anger":0.0143,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to improve camouflaged object detection.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_47f11d1a7119","title":"HAMUR: Hyper Adapter for Multi","content":"arXiv:2309.06217v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Multi-Domain Recommendation (MDR) has gained significant attention in recent years, which leverages data from multiple domains to enhance their performance concurrently.However, current MDR models are confronted with two limitations. Firstly, the majority of these models adopt an approach that explicitly shares parameters between domains, leading to mutual interference among them. Secondly, due to the distribution differences among domains, the utilization of static parameters in existing methods limits their flexibility to adapt to diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model Hyper Adapter for Multi-Domain Recommendation (HAMUR). Specifically, HAMUR consists of two components: (1). Domain-specific adapter, designed as a pluggable module that can be seamlessly integrated into various existing multi-domain backbone models, and (2). Domain-shared hyper-network, which implicitly captures shared information among domains and dynamically generates the parameters for the adapter. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets using various backbone networks. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed model.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06217","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.071784","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Xiaopeng Li, Fan Yan, Xiangyu Zhao, Yichao Wang, Bo Chen, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang","raw_content_length":1247,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multi-Domain Recommendation","MDR"],"persons":["Hyper Adapter"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1246,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HAMUR","Hyper Adapter","Multi","domains","arXiv230906217v2 Announce Type","Multi-Domain Recommendation","MDR","significant attention","recent years","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["domains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HAMUR":2.0,"Hyper Adapter":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"domains":2.0,"arXiv230906217v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Multi-Domain Recommendation":1.0,"MDR":1.0,"significant attention":1.0,"recent years":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762618497777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9137,"joy":0.0031,"surprise":0.0383,"sadness":0.0114,"fear":0.0057,"anger":0.0125,"disgust":0.0153},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new model for multi-domain recommendation.

Furthermore, the lack of uncertainty quantification in most CD methods hinders users from diagnosing and refining results. To address these issues, we introduce Ancestral GFlowNets (AGFNs). AGFN samples ancestral graphs (AGs) proportionally to a score-based belief distribution representing our epistemic uncertainty over the causal relationships. Building upon this distribution, we propose an elicitation framework for expert-driven assessment. This framework comprises an optimal experimental design to probe the expert and a scheme to incorporate the obtained feedback into AGFN. Our experiments show that: i) AGFN is competitive against other methods that address latent confounding on both synthetic and real-world datasets; and ii) our design for incorporating feedback from a (simulated) human expert or a Large Language Model (LLM) improves inference quality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12032","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.072158","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Tiago da Silva, Bruna Bazaluk, Eliezer de Souza da Silva, Ant\\'onio G\\'ois, Dominik Heider, Samuel Kaski, Diego Mesquita, Ad\\`ele Helena Ribeiro","raw_content_length":1119,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ancestral"],"persons":[],"locations":["AGFN"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1118,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Expert","arXiv230912032v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Causal discovery","algorithms","data","unreliable causal relations","expert knowledge","latent confounders","the lack"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Causal discovery"],"ai_ml":["algorithms","data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Expert":2.0,"arXiv230912032v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Causal discovery":1.0,"algorithms":1.0,"data":1.0,"unreliable causal relations":1.0,"expert knowledge":1.0,"latent confounders":1.0,"the lack":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7626333094444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.408,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7184,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3644,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0323,"sadness":0.1043,"fear":0.2882,"anger":0.1423,"disgust":0.063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new causal discovery algorithm, Ancestral GFlowNets (AGFNs), and demonstrates improved inference quality on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Both semitopologies and semiframes are relatively recent developments, arising from a novel application of topological ideas to study decentralised computing systems. Semitopologies generalise topology by removing the condition that intersections of open sets are necessarily open. The motivation comes from identifying the notion of an actionable coalition in a distributed system -- a set of participants with sufficient resources for its members to collaborate to take some action -- with open set; since just because two sets are actionable (have the resources to act) does not necessarily mean that their intersection is. We define notions of category and morphism and prove a categorical duality between (sober) semiframes and (spatial) semitopologies, and we investigate how key well-behavedness properties that are relevant to understanding decentralised systems, transfer (or do not transfer) across the duality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00956","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.072553","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","mathgn","mathct","preprints","cslo","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Murdoch J.
