However, a unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We define representation efficiency $\\eta$ as the ratio between the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\\eta = 1$) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10980","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.847151","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","mathst","preprints","cscv","research","mathit","statth","csit","computer-science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Di Zhang","raw_content_length":1243,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SSL","the Fisher Information Matrix","the Optimal Representation Efficiency","FIM"],"persons":["Barlow Twins"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1242,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Optimal Representation Efficiency","Barlow Twins","representation efficiency","arXiv251010980v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Self-supervised learning","SSL","remarkable success","meaningful representations","labeled data"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Optimal Representation Efficiency":2.0,"Barlow Twins":2.0,"representation efficiency":2.0,"arXiv251010980v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Self-supervised learning":1.0,"SSL":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"meaningful representations":1.0,"labeled data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7554220847222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.850999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9702,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8346,"joy":0.0327,"surprise":0.0872,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0132,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical analysis of a self-supervised learning method (Barlow Twins) and its representation efficiency.

However, existing research remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles. To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST (Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates, highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains like hiring.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10998","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.852143","language":"en","tags":["cslg","cscy","csai","preprints","research","cscl","cshc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Mahika Phutane, Hayoung Jung, Matthew Kim, Tanushree Mitra, Aditya Vashistha","raw_content_length":1280,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PwD"],"persons":[],"locations":["the Global South"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1279,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Intersectional Disability Bias","LLM","PwD","arXiv251010998v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language models","LLMs","scrutiny","identity-based discrimination","high-stakes domains"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM","Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Intersectional Disability Bias":2.0,"LLM":2.0,"PwD":2.0,"arXiv251010998v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"scrutiny":1.0,"identity-based discrimination":1.0,"high-stakes domains":1.0}},"age_hours":2.755582205,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8634,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.0267,"sadness":0.0096,"fear":0.036,"anger":0.0283,"disgust":0.0318},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":10,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies and quantifies intersectional biases in LLMs related to hiring, specifically focusing on disability.

Our approach integrates two key technical contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA), an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.

In knowledge-based failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2) contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire engineering chain in the future.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11003","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.853347","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csir","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Takuma Fujiu, Sho Okazaki, Kohei Kaminishi, Yuji Nakata, Shota Hamamoto, Kenshin Yokose, Tatsunori Hara, Yasushi Umeda, Jun Ota","raw_content_length":1339,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FBS","FBS Model arXiv:2510.11003v1 Announce Type","Function-Behavior-Structure"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1338,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["failures","FBS Model","arXiv251011003v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","manufacturing systems","the causes","production efficiency","knowledge-based failure-cause inference","the knowledge base","knowledge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["failures"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"failures":3.0,"FBS Model":2.0,"arXiv251011003v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"manufacturing systems":1.0,"the causes":1.0,"production efficiency":1.0,"knowledge-based failure-cause inference":1.0,"the knowledge base":1.0,"knowledge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7556280719444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9307,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.0101,"anger":0.0107,"disgust":0.0088},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a method for failure-cause inference in manufacturing systems using a knowledge ontology.

Although foundation models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas. Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform, extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11005","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.854156","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Kai Han, Siqi Ma, Chengxuan Qian, Jun Chen, Chongwen Lyu, Yuqing Song, Zhe Liu","raw_content_length":1422,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1421,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Frequency Domain","New Perspectives","Abdominal Medical Image Segmentation","arXiv251011005v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Accurate segmentation","tumors","normal tissues","medical images","surgical planning"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Frequency Domain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Frequency Domain":2.0,"New Perspectives":2.0,"Abdominal Medical Image Segmentation":2.0,"arXiv251011005v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Accurate segmentation":1.0,"tumors":1.0,"normal tissues":1.0,"medical images":1.0,"surgical planning":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7556574955555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9079,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0245,"sadness":0.0089,"fear":0.0163,"anger":0.0135,"disgust":0.0198},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new medical image segmentation framework (FASS) that enhances the accuracy of tumor detection.

While traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning. Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets, necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for both analytical and transactional workloads. GrASP enhances prefetching accuracy and scalability by leveraging logical block address deltas and combining query representations with result encodings. It frames prefetching as a context-aware multi-label classification task, using multi-layer LSTMs to predict delta patterns from embedded context.

Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM predictions.

While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its \\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm (AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \\textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN) are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary. Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method for improving adversarial robustness.

Our main contribution is the first rigorous convergence proof for the parareal-L1 scheme in this nonlinear subdiffusive setting. By constructing suitable energy norms and exploiting the orthogonality of the spectral basis, we establish that the parareal iterations converge exactly to the fully serial L1-spectral solution in a finite number of steps, with rates independent of the fractional exponent. The spectral spatial discretization yields exponential accuracy in space, while the parareal structure induces a clock speedup proportional to the number of processors, making the overall method highly efficient. Numerical experiments for both subdiffusive and classical diffusion problems confirm our theoretical estimates and demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in computational time compared to the conventional sequential solver. We observe that the speedup of the parareal method increases linearly with the fine integrator degrees of freedom.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11023","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.858355","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Josefa Caballero, {\\L}ukasz P{\\l}ociniczak, Kishin Sadarangani","raw_content_length":1308,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Galerkin","Announce Type","Caputo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1307,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["time","space","Parareal","new Abstract","the initial-boundary value problem","a quasilinear time-fractional diffusion equation","a fully discrete solver","the parareal algorithm","a L1 finite-difference approximation","the Caputo derivative"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the parareal algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"time":3.0,"space":3.0,"Parareal":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the initial-boundary value problem":1.0,"a quasilinear time-fractional diffusion equation":1.0,"a fully discrete solver":1.0,"the parareal algorithm":1.0,"a L1 finite-difference approximation":1.0,"the Caputo derivative":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7558048494444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7078,"joy":0.1548,"surprise":0.0993,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0116,"anger":0.0162,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm for solving time-fractional diffusion equations, achieving up to an order of magnitude reduction in computational time compared to conventional solvers.

However, the community still lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \\textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset, we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation.

However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results.

We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations. The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP) identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning fundamental grasping characteristics.

Existing repository summarization techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree, which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore, it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from 29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by existing approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11039","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.861307","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Yifeng Zhu, Xianlin Zhao, Xutian Li, Yanzhen Zou, Haizhuo Yuan, Yue Wang, Bing Xie","raw_content_length":1281,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RepoSummary","HGEN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1280,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["RepoSummary Feature","arXiv251011039v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Repository summarization","a crucial research question","development","maintenance","software engineering","Existing repository summarization techniques","code"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["a crucial research question"],"engineering":["development","software engineering"],"ai_ml":["maintenance"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"RepoSummary Feature":2.0,"arXiv251011039v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Repository summarization":1.0,"a crucial research question":1.0,"development":1.0,"maintenance":1.0,"software engineering":1.0,"Existing repository summarization techniques":1.0,"code":1.0}},"age_hours":2.755906928888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9101,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0355,"sadness":0.0119,"fear":0.0121,"anger":0.0126,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new approach to repository summarization, RepoSummary, and compares it to an existing baseline.

However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous gateway, achieving > 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33% higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross (SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant cloud gateways.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11043","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.862717","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csni","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Yuemeng Xu, Haoran Chen, Jiarui Guo, Mingwei Cui, Qiuheng Yin, Cheng Dong, Daxiang Kang, Xian Wu, Chenmin Sun, Peng He, Yang Gao, Lirong Lai, Kai Wang, Hongyu Wu, Tong Yang, Xiyun Xu","raw_content_length":1911,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ByteDance","DPU"],"persons":["Zephyrus"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1910,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Zephyrus","Gateways","the Petabit-Era","DPU","Announce Type","new Abstract","petabit-scale","ByteDances cloud gateways","critical aggregation points","a wide array"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Zephyrus":2.0,"Gateways":2.0,"the Petabit-Era":2.0,"DPU":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"petabit-scale":1.0,"ByteDances cloud gateways":1.0,"critical aggregation points":1.0,"a wide array":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7559514819444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6008,"joy":0.0152,"surprise":0.015,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.2544,"anger":0.0663,"disgust":0.0409},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"Zephyrus is a production-scale gateway that integrates DPUs with Tofino-based gateways, leading to 21% lower power consumption and 14% lower hardware cost compared to previous generation.

Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream, mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding (HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11052","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.864299","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Qinglin Zhu, Yizhen Yao, Runcong Zhao, Yanzheng Xiang, Amrutha Saseendran, Chen Jin, Philip Alexander Teare, Bin Liang, Yulan He, Lin Gui","raw_content_length":1310,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LRD","Latent Refinement"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1309,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Latent Refinement Decoding","Enhancing Diffusion","arXiv251011052v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Autoregressive AR models","the standard","natural language generation","high latency","strictly sequential decoding","Recent diffusion-inspired approaches"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Latent Refinement Decoding":2.0,"Enhancing Diffusion":2.0,"arXiv251011052v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Autoregressive AR models":1.0,"the standard":1.0,"natural language generation":1.0,"high latency":1.0,"strictly sequential decoding":1.0,"Recent diffusion-inspired approaches":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7560115838888892,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.38449999999999984,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9231,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8405,"joy":0.0036,"surprise":0.0306,"sadness":0.0594,"fear":0.0118,"anger":0.0197,"disgust":0.0344},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm (LRD) that improves the speed and accuracy of parallel sequence generation.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d82dab70e5cc","title":"From Reasoning LLMs to BERT: A Two","content":"arXiv:2510.11056v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process: domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same student model under \"standard\" and \"reasoning-augmented\" inputs as a teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit reasoning path at inference.

This paper presents a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy, highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.

These resources enable rigorous evaluation of repair techniques and support the retraining of learning-based approaches for enhanced performance. Using Defects4C, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the effectiveness of 24 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in repairing C/C++ faults.

MAS improves task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However, applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and multi-policy models. We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single- and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks, AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5 percent.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3bc857ae976e","title":"Detecting Gender Stereotypes in Scratch Programming Tutorials","content":"arXiv:2510.11064v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Gender stereotypes in introductory programming courses often go unnoticed, yet they can negatively influence young learners' interest and learning, particularly under-represented groups such as girls. Popular tutorials on block-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases through character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators currently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large language models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this problem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However, LLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in Scratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content. We develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters, content, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis tools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this framework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype smells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational platforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice. LLMs are not effective at detecting them, but our gender bias evaluation framework can guide LLMs in generating tutorials with fewer stereotype smells.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11064","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.867781","language":"en","tags":["cscy","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Isabella Gra{\\ss}l, Benedikt Fein, Gordon Fraser","raw_content_length":1495,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Scratch","Scratch Programming Tutorials arXiv:2510.11064v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["Gender Stereotypes"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1494,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gender Stereotypes","Scratch Programming Tutorials","arXiv251011064v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Gender stereotypes","introductory programming courses","young learners interest","learning","particularly under-represented groups","girls"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Scratch Programming Tutorials","introductory programming courses"],"ai_ml":["learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gender Stereotypes":2.0,"Scratch Programming Tutorials":2.0,"arXiv251011064v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Gender stereotypes":1.0,"introductory programming courses":1.0,"young learners interest":1.0,"learning":1.0,"particularly under-represented groups":1.0,"girls":1.0}},"age_hours":2.756121366111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5835,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0334,"sadness":0.0622,"fear":0.0426,"anger":0.0618,"disgust":0.2107},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on identifying and mitigating gender stereotypes in educational programming materials using LLMs. While it doesn't directly impact climate change, it addresses equity in STEM education, which can indirectly contribute to a more diverse and inclusive workforce tackling climate challenges.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_753f89fa3594","title":"Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click","content":"arXiv:2510.11066v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8991ac71357f","title":"Efficient Edge Test","content":"arXiv:2510.11068v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while $\\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_4338c75395fd","title":"DebugTA: An LLM","content":"arXiv:2510.11076v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.870251","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":266,"author":"Lingyue Fu, Haowei Yuan, Datong Chen, Xinyi Dai, Qingyao Li, Weinan Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Yong Yu","raw_content_length":1937,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.33,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","Debugging and Teaching"],"persons":["DebugTA"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1936,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DebugTA An LLM","arXiv251011076v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","programming education","Debugging","Teaching DT task","a common scenario","students","assistance","their erroneous code"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["DebugTA An LLM"],"engineering":["programming education"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DebugTA An LLM":2.0,"arXiv251011076v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"programming education":1.0,"Debugging":1.0,"Teaching DT task":1.0,"a common scenario":1.0,"students":1.0,"assistance":1.0,"their erroneous code":1.0}},"age_hours":2.756208061666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7790000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8442,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6243,"joy":0.0177,"surprise":0.0567,"sadness":0.1574,"fear":0.0509,"anger":0.0566,"disgust":0.0363},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent (DebugTA) that reduces computational costs.

Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding.

In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to infer the corresponding causal factors.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3c0df008f521","title":"UXer","content":"arXiv:2510.11087v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In recent years, discussions on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into UX design have intensified. However, the practical application of AI tools in design is limited by their operation within overly simplified scenarios, inherent complexity and unpredictability, and a general lack of relevant education. This study proposes an effective UXer-AI collaboration process to address these issues and seeks to identify efficient AI collaboration strategies through a series of user studies. In a preliminary study, two participatory design workshops identified major barriers to UXer-AI collaboration, including unfamiliarity with AI, inadequate internal support, and trust issues. To address the particularly critical issue of diminished trust, this study developed a new AI prototype model, TW-AI, that incorporates verification and decision-making processes to enhance trust and operational efficiency in UX design tasks. Task performance experiments and in-depth interviews evaluated the TW-AI model, revealing significant improvements in practitioners' trust, work efficiency, understanding of usage timing, and controllability. The \"Source\" function, based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, notably enhanced the reliability of the AI tool. Participants noted improved communication efficiency and reduced decision-making time, attributing these outcomes to the model's comprehensive verification features and streamlined approach to complex verification tasks. This study advances UXer-AI collaboration by providing key insights, bridging research and practice with actionable strategies, and establishing guidelines for AI tool designs tailored to UX. It contributes to the HCI community by outlining a scalable UXer-AI collaboration framework that addresses immediate operational challenges and lays the foundation for future advancements in AI-driven UX methodologies.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11087","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.873344","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cshc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Harin Yoon, Dongwhan Kim, Changhoon Oh, Soojin Jun","raw_content_length":1947,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Artificial Intelligence (AI","TW-AI","UXer arXiv:2510.11087v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1946,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251011087v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","recent years","discussions","Artificial Intelligence","UX design","the practical application","AI tools","design","their operation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Artificial Intelligence"],"engineering":["design"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251011087v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"recent years":1.0,"discussions":1.0,"Artificial Intelligence":1.0,"UX design":1.0,"the practical application":1.0,"AI tools":1.0,"design":1.0,"their operation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7563064444444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8661,"joy":0.0173,"surprise":0.0549,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0315,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0044},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a prototype AI tool (TW-AI) designed to improve UX design processes.

Modular Function Deployment (MFD) is a widely adopted method for defining modular product architectures, yet it lacks systematic support for assembly considerations during early concept and system-level development. This limitation increases the risk of delayed production ramp-up and lifecycle inefficiencies. This paper proposes a set of enhancements to MFD that integrate Design for Assembly (DFA) logic into architectural synthesis. The extended method introduces structured heuristics, assembly-oriented module drivers, a coded interface taxonomy, and quantitative metrics for assessing assembly feasibility and automation readiness. These additions preserve compatibility with standard MFD workflows while enriching decision-making with traceable, production-informed reasoning. An illustrative case study involving a handheld leaf blower demonstrates the method's usability and effectiveness. The redesigned architecture shows reduced assembly effort, simplified interfaces, and increased automation potential.

Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e5a2b80faf4d","title":"Future-Aware End","content":"arXiv:2510.11092v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11092","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.874997","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Bozhou Zhang, Nan Song, Jingyu Li, Xiatian Zhu, Jiankang Deng, Li Zhang","raw_content_length":1628,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Future-Aware End arXiv:2510.11092v1 Announce Type","SeerDrive"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1627,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Future-Aware End","arXiv251011092v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","end","future driving actions","planned trajectories","traditional modular pipelines","these approaches","promise","a one-shot paradigm"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Future-Aware End":2.0,"arXiv251011092v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"end":1.0,"future driving actions":1.0,"planned trajectories":1.0,"traditional modular pipelines":1.0,"these approaches":1.0,"promise":1.0,"a one-shot paradigm":1.0}},"age_hours":2.756363671111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8883,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0232,"sadness":0.0119,"fear":0.0256,"anger":0.0237,"disgust":0.0239},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel end-to-end framework (SeerDrive) for autonomous driving that aims to improve decision-making in complex scenarios.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0f58a5ee822e","title":"Design and Koopman Model Predictive Control of A Soft Exoskeleton Based on Origami","content":"arXiv:2510.11094v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on. Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to great extent.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0ce3eab66792","title":"CoDefend: Cross","content":"arXiv:2510.11096v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies. Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11096","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.876360","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Fengling Zhu, Boshi Liu, Jingyu Hua, Sheng Zhong","raw_content_length":1910,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1905,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CoDefend Cross","arXiv251011096v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Multimodal Large Language Models","MLLMs","remarkable success","tasks","visual question","cross-modal reasoning","visual and textual modalities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CoDefend Cross":2.0,"arXiv251011096v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multimodal Large Language Models":1.0,"MLLMs":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"visual question":1.0,"cross-modal reasoning":1.0,"visual and textual modalities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.756406955,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.0775000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7845,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7132,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0146,"sadness":0.0106,"fear":0.1268,"anger":0.0856,"disgust":0.0428},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel defense mechanism against adversarial attacks on multimodal AI systems.

However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.877312","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csir","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Shuwei Chen, Jiajun Cui, Zhengqi Xu, Fan Zhang, Jiangke Fan, Teng Zhang, Xingxing Wang","raw_content_length":1949,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Modeling Sequential","CTR","Set arXiv:2510.11100v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1948,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HoMer","Heterogeneities","Modeling Sequential","Set","arXiv251011100v1 Announce Type","new Abstract Click-through rate CTR prediction","which","behavior sequence","non-sequential features","useritem profiles"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HoMer":2.0,"Heterogeneities":2.0,"Modeling Sequential":2.0,"Set":2.0,"arXiv251011100v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract Click-through rate CTR prediction":1.0,"which":1.0,"behavior sequence":1.0,"non-sequential features":1.0,"useritem profiles":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7564375711111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9117,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0303,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.0089,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.0166},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel recommender system (HoMer) that improves efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments.

Because SO(3) admits no global, smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles, quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across algorithms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11103","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.877744","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Martin Schuck, Sherif Samy, Angela P.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_09cc2909a8e4","title":"Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Non","content":"arXiv:2510.11104v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative, non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance. Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that, with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11104","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.878143","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Junjie Lu, Yuliang Liu, Chaofeng Qu, Wei Shen, Zhouhan Lin, Min Xu","raw_content_length":1386,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Non arXiv:2510.11104v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","Confidence-Guided Reasoning Path Preference Optimization"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1385,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLM Reasoning","Non","arXiv251011104v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Current approaches","LLM reasoning","a training bias","human-like reasoning trajectories","step-wise preference optimization","in particular dependence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Reasoning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLM Reasoning":2.0,"Non":2.0,"arXiv251011104v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Current approaches":1.0,"LLM reasoning":1.0,"a training bias":1.0,"human-like reasoning trajectories":1.0,"step-wise preference optimization":1.0,"in particular dependence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7564673947222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.1125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8225,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.85,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.0362,"sadness":0.0156,"fear":0.0164,"anger":0.0341,"disgust":0.0335},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new method (CGPO) for enhancing LLM reasoning, which could indirectly support sustainability efforts by improving the efficiency and accuracy of AI models used in climate modeling, resource management, or other sustainability-related applications.
