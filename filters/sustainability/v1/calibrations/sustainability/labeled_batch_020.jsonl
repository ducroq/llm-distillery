{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3e9d5f9dfcf2","title":"Dynamic Generation of Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.07799v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative framework called \\textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g., accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07799","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.186251","language":"en","tags":["cscl","computer-science","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Eric Hanchen Jiang, Guancheng Wan, Sophia Yin, Mengting Li, Yuchen Wu, Xiao Liang, Xinfeng Li, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang, Kai-Wei Chang, Ying Nian Wu","raw_content_length":1456,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Topology Diffusion"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1455,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dynamic Generation","Multi","arXiv251007799v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The efficiency","multi-agent systems","large language models","LLMs","their communication topology","an optimal topology"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dynamic Generation":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251007799v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The efficiency":1.0,"multi-agent systems":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"their communication topology":1.0,"an optimal topology":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7712686166666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.774,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.08,"sadness":0.0453,"fear":0.0355,"anger":0.0398,"disgust":0.0204},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework (GTD) for optimizing communication topologies in multi-agent systems using LLMs, potentially leading to more efficient resource utilization and reduced token consumption.

Coarse-grained snapshot rollbacks cause unacceptable data loss for legitimate users. Surgically removing an attack's impact is hindered by a fundamental challenge in high-concurrency environments: it is difficult to attribute resulting file and database modifications to a specific attack-related request. We present ANCORA, a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications without invasive instrumentation. ANCORA first isolates the full sequence of syscalls triggered by a single malicious request. Based on this sequence, ANCORA addresses file and database modifications separately. To trace file changes, it builds a provenance graph that reveals all modifications, including those by exploit-spawned processes. To attribute database operations, a more difficult challenge due to connection pooling, ANCORA introduces a novel spatiotemporal anchor. This anchor uses the request's network connection tuple and active time window to pinpoint exact database operations. With all malicious file and database operations precisely identified, ANCORA performs a unified rewind and selective replay recovery. It reverts the system to a clean snapshot taken before the attack, then selectively re-applies only legitimate operations to both the file system and database. This completely removes the attack's effects while preserving concurrent legitimate data. We evaluated ANCORA on 10 web applications and 20 CVE-based attack scenarios with concurrency up to 150 connections. Experiments demonstrate ANCORA achieves 99.9% recovery accuracy with manageable overhead: up to 19.8% response latency increase and 17.8% QPS decrease in worst cases, and recovery throughput of 110.7 database operations per second and 27.2 affected files per second, effectively preserving legitimate data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07806","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.186695","language":"en","tags":["research","cscr","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Yihao Peng, Biao Ma, Hai Wan, Xibin Zhao","raw_content_length":1899,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.295,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Accurate Intrusion Recovery for Web Applications arXiv:2510.07806v1 Announce"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1898,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Accurate Intrusion Recovery","Web Applications","arXiv251007806v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Modern web application recovery","a critical dilemma","Coarse-grained snapshot rollbacks","unacceptable data loss","legitimate users","an attacks impact"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Coarse-grained snapshot rollbacks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Accurate Intrusion Recovery":2.0,"Web Applications":2.0,"arXiv251007806v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Modern web application recovery":1.0,"a critical dilemma":1.0,"Coarse-grained snapshot rollbacks":1.0,"unacceptable data loss":1.0,"legitimate users":1.0,"an attacks impact":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7712831600000003,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7045000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8591,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8161,"joy":0.004,"surprise":0.0153,"sadness":0.0144,"fear":0.0707,"anger":0.0523,"disgust":0.0272},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"ANCORA is a system for precise intrusion recovery in web applications.

To our knowledge, no unified, physics-based model captures these dynamics across the full range of common MMVs and wheel layouts. We propose the \"Generalized Micro-mobility Model\" (GM3), a tire-level formulation based on the tire brush representation that supports arbitrary wheel configurations, including single/double track and multi-wheel platforms. We introduce an interactive model-agnostic simulation framework that decouples vehicle/layout specification from dynamics to compare the GM3 with the KBM and other models, consisting of fixed step RK4 integration, human-in-the-loop and scripted control, real-time trajectory traces and logging for analysis.

In this paper, we present a practical and stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections: malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1) low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3) one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot, keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters.

Despite their significance in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements. Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods, underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07810","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.188295","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Luu Tu Nguyen, Vu Tram Anh Khuong, Thi Bich Phuong Man, Thi Duyen Ngo, Thanh Ha Le","raw_content_length":1527,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow","COF"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1526,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FMANet","A Novel Dual","arXiv251007810v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Facial micro","expressions","their subtle and brief nature","valuable indicators","genuine emotions","their significance"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FMANet":2.0,"A Novel Dual":2.0,"arXiv251007810v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Facial micro":1.0,"expressions":1.0,"their subtle and brief nature":1.0,"valuable indicators":1.0,"genuine emotions":1.0,"their significance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.771344259166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1765,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6353,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9223,"joy":0.0125,"surprise":0.0364,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0105,"anger":0.0083,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel neural network architecture (FMANet) for facial micro-expression recognition.

To investigate this tension, we formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position. Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning, while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction.

However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of MLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually crafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently diverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle or deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this paper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX leverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy to encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that iteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases. Starting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and semantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX on the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a 30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple new root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it detects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2% code coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%. Ablation studies further confirm the critical role of both perturbed generation and diversity augmentation in FLEX's effectiveness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07815","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.189888","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Zeyu Sun, Jingjing Liang, Weiyi Wang, Chenyao Suo, Junjie Chen, Fanjiang Xu","raw_content_length":1544,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MLIR","FLEX","Interleaved Learning and Exploration: A Self arXiv:2510.07815v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1543,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Interleaved Learning","Exploration","A Self","MLIR","arXiv251007815v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Multi-Level Intermediate Representation","a foundational technology","modern compiler frameworks","extensibility"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MLIR"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Interleaved Learning":2.0,"Exploration":2.0,"A Self":2.0,"MLIR":2.0,"arXiv251007815v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multi-Level Intermediate Representation":1.0,"a foundational technology":1.0,"modern compiler frameworks":1.0,"extensibility":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7714077575,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.388,"joy":0.0127,"surprise":0.0253,"sadness":0.0184,"fear":0.5316,"anger":0.0191,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel fuzzing framework (FLEX) for the MLIR compiler.

However, existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

By using two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November 5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07821","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.190714","language":"en","tags":["cscl","computer-science","preprints","cssi","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Raisa M.

Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07823","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.191524","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Shohei Enomoto","raw_content_length":1744,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Color"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1743,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Expanded Transformation Space","Overfitting Mitigation","arXiv251007823v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Visual prompting","a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach","pre-trained vision models","tasks","model parameters","advantages"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["pre-trained vision models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Expanded Transformation Space":2.0,"Overfitting Mitigation":2.0,"arXiv251007823v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Visual prompting":1.0,"a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach":1.0,"pre-trained vision models":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"model parameters":1.0,"advantages":1.0}},"age_hours":2.771478846111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.086,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1828,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9021,"joy":0.0229,"surprise":0.0402,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0062,"anger":0.0156,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new visual prompting method (ACAVP) that improves the accuracy of image classification models.

At the heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction. Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to 1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e256c76d49fc","title":"PrismGS: Physically-Grounded Anti-Aliasing for High","content":"arXiv:2510.07830v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07830","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.193111","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Houqiang Zhong, Zhenglong Wu, Sihua Fu, Zihan Zheng, Xin Jin, Xiaoyun Zhang, Li Song, Qiang Hu","raw_content_length":1740,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["3DGS"],"persons":["Gaussian","Gaussian Splatting"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1739,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PrismGS Physically-Grounded Anti-Aliasing","arXiv251007830v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","3D Gaussian Splatting","3DGS","real-time photorealistic rendering","compact scenes","large urban environments","severe aliasing artifacts","optimization instability"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PrismGS Physically-Grounded Anti-Aliasing":2.0,"arXiv251007830v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"3D Gaussian Splatting":1.0,"3DGS":1.0,"real-time photorealistic rendering":1.0,"compact scenes":1.0,"large urban environments":1.0,"severe aliasing artifacts":1.0,"optimization instability":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7715411858333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8173,"joy":0.0033,"surprise":0.0314,"sadness":0.017,"fear":0.0401,"anger":0.0457,"disgust":0.0453},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel anti-aliasing technique (PrismGS) for 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving rendering quality in large urban environments.

This paper proposes a tenant budget-aware (tenant-centric) data replication framework for Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM). The proposed strategy dynamically creates data replicas based on predefined thresholds for response time, economic budget of the tenant and data popularity. TCDRM employs a heuristic replica placement algorithm that leverages the diverse pricing structures of multiple cloud providers. The TCDRM strategy aims to maintain the required performance without exceeding the tenant's budget by taking advantage of the capabilities offered by multicloud environments. The middleware considered acts as an intermediary between tenants and multiple cloud providers, facilitating intelligent replica placement decisions. To achieve this, the proposed TCDRM strategy defines strict thresholds for tenant budget and response time. A performance evaluation is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. The results show that our approach effectively meets tenant performance objectives while respecting their economic constraints. Bandwidth consumption is reduced by up to 78% compared to non-replicated approaches, and average response time for complex queries is decreased by 51%, all while adhering to tenant budget limitations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07833","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.193520","language":"en","tags":["csdb","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Santatra Hagamalala Bernardin (IRIT-PYRAMIDE, IRIT), Riad Mokadem (IRIT-PYRAMIDE, IRIT), Franck Morvan (IRIT-PYRAMIDE, IRIT), Hasinarivo Ramanana, Hasimandimby Rakotoarivelo","raw_content_length":1441,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1440,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["TCDRM","A Tenant Budget","arXiv251007833v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Multi-cloud computing systems","significant challenges","acceptable performance","tenant budget requirements","This paper","Multi-Cloud Computing"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"TCDRM":4.0,"A Tenant Budget":2.0,"arXiv251007833v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Multi-cloud computing systems":1.0,"significant challenges":1.0,"acceptable performance":1.0,"tenant budget requirements":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"Multi-Cloud Computing":1.0}},"age_hours":2.771555548055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.520999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9042,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8973,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0307,"sadness":0.0118,"fear":0.0321,"anger":0.0149,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper presents a tenant budget-aware data replication framework (TCDRM) for multi-cloud computing, aiming to reduce bandwidth consumption and response time while adhering to budget constraints.

Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by systematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler bug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach for extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is that bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler bugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated method to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into existing mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from 1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with all their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that \"bug history\" mutators are effective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler fuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed, validating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler fuzzers should leverage.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07834","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.193904","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Lingjun Liu, Feiran Qin, Owolabi Legunsen, Marcelo d'Amorim","raw_content_length":1219,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bug Histories as Sources","IssueMut","GCC","Compiler Fuzzing Mutators","LLVM"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1218,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bug Histories","Sources","Compiler Fuzzing Mutators","arXiv251007834v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Bugs","compilers","which","critical infrastructure","negative impacts"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bug Histories":2.0,"Sources":2.0,"Compiler Fuzzing Mutators":2.0,"arXiv251007834v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Bugs":1.0,"compilers":1.0,"which":1.0,"critical infrastructure":1.0,"negative impacts":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7715714491666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.9899999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.802,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8953,"joy":0.0072,"surprise":0.0137,"sadness":0.0099,"fear":0.0118,"anger":0.0258,"disgust":0.0363},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach (IssueMut) to improve compiler fuzzing, which indirectly contributes to sustainability by enhancing the reliability of software used in various sectors, including those crucial for climate modeling and energy management.

Based on these insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_7ea713cac9bb","title":"AlignGS: Aligning Geometry and Semantics for Robust Indoor Reconstruction from Sparse Views","content":"arXiv:2510.07839v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization.

To address this, we present ACMID: a dataset for MSS generated through web crawling of extensive raw data, fol- lowed by automatic cleaning via an instrument classifier built on a pre-trained audio encoder that filters and aggregates clean segments of target instruments from the crawled tracks, resulting in the refined ACMID-Cleaned dataset. Leverag- ing abundant data, we expand the conventional classifica- tion from 4-stem (Vocal/Bass/Drums/Others) to 7-stem (Pi- ano/Drums/Bass/Acoustic Guitar/Electric Guitar/Strings/Wind- Brass), enabling high granularity MSS systems. Experiments on SOTA MSS model demonstrates two key results: (i) MSS model trained with ACMID-Cleaned achieved a 2.39dB improvement in SDR performance compared to that with ACMID-Uncleaned, demostrating the effectiveness of our data cleaning procedure; (ii) incorporating ACMID-Cleaned to training enhances MSS model's average performance by 1.16dB, confirming the value of our dataset.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_cf7e89ce36c7","title":"Meta-Learning Based Few","content":"arXiv:2510.07847v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07847","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.196706","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Liting Li, Yumeng Wang, Yueheng Sun","raw_content_length":1565,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Graph Neural Networks","MA-GAD","Meta-Learning Based Few arXiv:2510.07847v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1564,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Meta-Learning Based Few","arXiv251007847v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Graph-level anomaly detection","anomalous graphs","subgraphs","graph datasets","a vital role","various fields"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Meta-Learning Based Few":2.0,"arXiv251007847v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Graph-level anomaly detection":1.0,"anomalous graphs":1.0,"subgraphs":1.0,"graph datasets":1.0,"a vital role":1.0,"various fields":1.0}},"age_hours":2.771677061388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8852,"joy":0.0026,"surprise":0.0303,"sadness":0.0103,"fear":0.0397,"anger":0.0116,"disgust":0.0202},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel meta-learning framework for graph-level anomaly detection, demonstrating improved performance on biochemical datasets.

It extends the lambda-calculus, preserving the key features of confluent reduction and typed termination, to embed computational effects, evaluation strategies, and control flow operations. The first instalment modelled sequential higher-order computation with global store, input/output, probabilities, and non-determinism, and embedded both the call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus, as well as Moggi's computational metalanguage and Levy's call-by-push-value. The present paper extends the calculus from sequential to branching and looping control flow. This allows the faithful embedding of a minimal but complete imperative language, including conditionals, exception handling, and iteration, as well as constants and algebraic data types. The calculus is defined through a simple operational semantics, extending the (simplified) Krivine machine for the lambda-calculus with multiple operand stacks to model effects and a continuation stack to model sequential, branching, and looping computation. It features a confluent reduction relation and a system of simple types that guarantees termination of the machine and strong normalization of reduction (in the absence of iteration). These properties carry over to the embedded imperative language, providing a unified functional-imperative model of computation that supports simple types, a direct and intuitive operational semantics, and a confluent reduction semantics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07851","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.197099","language":"en","tags":["cspl","cslo","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Willem Heijltjes","raw_content_length":1618,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Functional Machine Calculus III: Control arXiv:2510.07851v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","The Functional Machine Calculus"],"persons":["Levy"],"locations":["Moggi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1615,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Functional Machine Calculus III","Control","arXiv251007851v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The Functional Machine Calculus","Heijltjes","a new approach","the imperative and functional programming paradigms","the lambda-calculus","the key features"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Control","the imperative and functional programming paradigms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Functional Machine Calculus III":2.0,"Control":2.0,"arXiv251007851v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The Functional Machine Calculus":1.0,"Heijltjes":1.0,"a new approach":1.0,"the imperative and functional programming paradigms":1.0,"the lambda-calculus":1.0,"the key features":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7716928449999996,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8554,"joy":0.0396,"surprise":0.0777,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0114,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on a new approach to unifying imperative and functional programming paradigms.

However, their generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between sparse views of the $360^\\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To handle these difficulties, we propose \\textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates. Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search together with pairwise causality testing.

The goal is to open $k$ centers to minimize an aggregate of the clustering costs -- e.g., the average or maximum -- where the cost is measured via $k$-center/median/means objectives. More generally, we minimize a norm $\\Psi$ over the $T$ cost values. We show that for $T \\geq 3$, the problem is inapproximable to any finite factor in polynomial time. For $T = 2$, we give constant-factor approximations. We also show W[2]-hardness when parameterized by $k$, but obtain $f(k,T)\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-time 3-approximations when parameterized by both $k$ and $T$. When the metrics have structure, we obtain efficient parameterized approximation schemes (EPAS). If all $T$ metrics have bounded $\\varepsilon$-scatter dimension, we achieve a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation in $f(k,T,\\varepsilon)\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ time. If the metrics are induced by edge weights on a common graph $G$ of bounded treewidth $\\mathsf{tw}$, and $\\Psi$ is the sum function, we get an EPAS in $f(T,\\varepsilon,\\mathsf{tw})\\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ time.

However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights, and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12 real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research partners.

Flow-based generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods. However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers, encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07865","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.199990","language":"en","tags":["csro","computer-science","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Guowei Zou, Haitao Wang, Hejun Wu, Yukun Qian, Yuhang Wang, Weibing Li","raw_content_length":1721,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["DM1"],"locations":["MeanFlow"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1720,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DM1","MeanFlow","Dispersive Regularization","arXiv251007865v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The ability","multi-modal action distributions","robotic manipulation policies","precise and robust control","Flow-based generative models"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DM1":2.0,"MeanFlow":2.0,"Dispersive Regularization":2.0,"arXiv251007865v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The ability":1.0,"multi-modal action distributions":1.0,"robotic manipulation policies":1.0,"precise and robust control":1.0,"Flow-based generative models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.771795213611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8751,"joy":0.0315,"surprise":0.0571,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0127,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel flow matching framework (DM1) for robotic manipulation, demonstrating improved success rates (10-20 percentage points) and faster inference times (20-40 times faster) on RoboMimic benchmarks and real-robot deployment.

Traditional RRS methods, with unpredictable path counts, are fundamentally incompatible with wavefront's preallocated memory and scheduling requirements. To resolve this, we introduce a normalized RRS formulation with a bounded path count, enabling stable and memory-efficient execution. Furthermore, we pioneer the use of neural networks to learn RRS factors, presenting two models: NRRS and AID-NRRS. At a high level, both feature a carefully designed RRSNet that explicitly incorporates RRS normalization, with only subtle differences in their implementation. To balance computational cost and inference accuracy, we introduce Mix-Depth, a path-depth-aware mechanism that adaptively regulates neural evaluation, further improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional heuristics and recent RRS techniques in both rendering quality and performance across a variety of complex scenes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07868","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.200368","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csgr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Haojie Jin, Jierui Ren, Yisong Chen, Guoping Wang, Sheng Li","raw_content_length":1224,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GPU","Mix-Depth","RRS"],"persons":["Russian Roulette"],"locations":["wavefront"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1219,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Splitting","Neural Russian Roulette","arXiv251007868v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a novel framework","Russian Roulette","RRS","wavefront path tracing","a highly parallel rendering architecture","path states"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Splitting":3.0,"Neural Russian Roulette":2.0,"arXiv251007868v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a novel framework":1.0,"Russian Roulette":1.0,"RRS":1.0,"wavefront path tracing":1.0,"a highly parallel rendering architecture":1.0,"path states":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7718101249999996,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8585,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7717,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8833,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.0541,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0123,"anger":0.0266,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel neural network approach to improve the efficiency of wavefront path tracing, a rendering technique used in computer graphics.

To address these limitations, we introduce USIM, a simulation-based multi-task Vision-Language-Action (VLA) dataset for underwater robots.

Building upon this dataset, we propose U0, a VLA model for general underwater robots, which integrates binocular vision and other sensor modalities through multimodal fusion, and further incorporates a convolution-attention-based perception focus enhancement module (CAP) to improve spatial understanding and mobile manipulation. Across tasks such as inspection, obstacle avoidance, scanning, and dynamic tracking, the framework achieves a success rate of 80%, while in challenging mobile manipulation tasks, it reduces the distance to the target by 21.2% compared with baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.

The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3aa3a53399bf","title":"Do LLMs Really Need 10+ Thoughts for \"Find the Time 1000 Days Later\"? Towards Structural Understanding of LLM Overthinking","content":"arXiv:2510.07880v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs' thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled overthinking management.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07880","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.202415","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Xinliang Frederick Zhang, Anhad Mohananey, Alexandra Chronopoulou, Pinelopi Papalampidi, Somit Gupta, Tsendsuren Munkhdalai, Lu Wang, Shyam Upadhyay","raw_content_length":1743,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CoT","TRACE"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1742,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","10 Thoughts","the Time","Structural Understanding","Announce Type","new Abstract","Models","thought","reasoning","superior performance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":2.0,"10 Thoughts":2.0,"the Time":2.0,"Structural Understanding":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Models":1.0,"thought":1.0,"reasoning":1.0,"superior performance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7718854905555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6295,"joy":0.0027,"surprise":0.0673,"sadness":0.0593,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.1488,"disgust":0.0839},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the overthinking problem in LLMs, finding that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on simple tasks without accuracy gains.

However, their effectiveness, especially in long-horizon tasks involving dual-arm humanoid robots, remains limited. This limitation arises from two main challenges: (i) the absence of simulation platforms that systematically support task evaluation and data collection for humanoid robots, and (ii) the insufficient embodiment awareness of current MLLMs, which hinders reasoning about dual-arm selection logic and body positions during planning. To address these issues, we present DualTHOR, a new dual-arm humanoid simulator, with continuous transition and a contingency mechanism. Building on this platform, we propose Proprio-MLLM, a model that enhances embodiment awareness by incorporating proprioceptive information with motion-based position embedding and a cross-spatial encoder. Experiments show that, while existing MLLMs struggle in this environment, Proprio-MLLM achieves an average improvement of 19.75% in planning performance.

However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising, and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of traditional weak-to-strong methods.

However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made. Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However, transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems: transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07889","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.205177","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","cshc","preprints","cscy","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Dave Murray-Rust, Kars Alfrink, Cristina Zaga","raw_content_length":1250,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Civic AI Systems arXiv:2510.07889v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1249,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["decisions","Meaningful Transparency","Civic AI Systems","arXiv251007889v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Artificial intelligence","a part","the provision","governmental services","benefits"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Civic AI Systems","Artificial intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"decisions":3.0,"Meaningful Transparency":2.0,"Civic AI Systems":2.0,"arXiv251007889v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Artificial intelligence":1.0,"a part":1.0,"the provision":1.0,"governmental services":1.0,"benefits":1.0}},"age_hours":2.771994894444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.1125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8225,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8097,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0103,"sadness":0.0113,"fear":0.0286,"anger":0.0566,"disgust":0.0771},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a framework for meaningful transparency in civic AI systems.

However, dialects are primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like output.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07890","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.205577","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Verena Blaschke, Miriam Winkler, Barbara Plank","raw_content_length":1039,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["sys"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1038,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251007890v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Research","cross-dialectal transfer","a standard","a non-standard dialect variety","text data","dialects","non-standard spellings"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["Research"],"research_academic":["Research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251007890v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Research":1.0,"cross-dialectal transfer":1.0,"a standard":1.0,"a non-standard dialect variety":1.0,"text data":1.0,"dialects":1.0,"non-standard spellings":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7720122325000003,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8889,"joy":0.0044,"surprise":0.0597,"sadness":0.0208,"fear":0.0091,"anger":0.0109,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores cross-dialectal transfer in speech and text models, releasing a new dialectal audio intent classification dataset.

In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective, deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution, including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07892","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.205963","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Hyeonseok Moon, Seongtae Hong, Jaehyung Seo, Heuiseok Lim","raw_content_length":1228,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.795,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MCBench","LLM","NLP"],"persons":["Metric Calculating Benchmark"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1227,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Metric Calculating Benchmark","Code","Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent frontier-level LLMs","many previously difficult benchmarks","little room","further differentiation","This progress","the need"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Recent frontier-level LLMs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Metric Calculating Benchmark":2.0,"Code":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent frontier-level LLMs":1.0,"many previously difficult benchmarks":1.0,"little room":1.0,"further differentiation":1.0,"This progress":1.0,"the need":1.0}},"age_hours":2.772027664722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.6455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3291,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8778,"joy":0.0115,"surprise":0.0186,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.041,"anger":0.0294,"disgust":0.018},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new benchmark (MCBench) for evaluating LLMs' ability to execute string-matching NLP metrics.

This research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression (NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR. In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07895","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.206378","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"D.

This failure is particularly acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight, we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B.

Although topology optimization holds great potential for tuning these nonlinear dynamic responses, its use in high-dimensional systems is limited by the high cost of repeated response and sensitivity analyses. To address this challenge, we employ the spectral submanifolds (SSMs) reduction theory, which reformulates the periodic response as the equilibria of an associated reduced-order model (ROM). This enables efficient and analytic evaluation of both response amplitudes and their sensitivities. Based on the SSM-based ROM, we formulate optimization problems that optimize the peak amplitude, the hardening/softening behavior, and the distance between two saddle-node bifurcations for an FRC. The proposed method is applied to the design of nonlinear MEMS devices, achieving targeted performance optimization.

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions.

Existing works primarily focus on a specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1) compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers, (2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple grading metrics.

Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round, creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to $k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors, reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets, network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07922","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.210327","language":"en","tags":["csdc","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":237,"author":"Murtaza Rangwala, Farag Azzedin, Richard O.

Recent studies have improved the performance of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient self-distillation schemes: (1) \\textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the stronger \"teacher\" guides the weaker \"student\", effectively improving overall performance. (2) \\textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the \"teacher\", distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation.

In sensitive domains, such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference (NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when answering user queries based on multiple sources.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07926","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.211941","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Adam Dejl, James Barry, Alessandra Pascale, Javier Carnerero Cano","raw_content_length":1317,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","Comprehensiveness Metrics for Automatic Evaluation of Factual Recall","NLI","Q&A"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1312,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Comprehensiveness Metrics","Automatic Evaluation","Factual Recall","Text Generation","arXiv251007926v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","remarkable performance","a wide range","tasks","large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Comprehensiveness Metrics":2.0,"Automatic Evaluation":2.0,"Factual Recall":2.0,"Text Generation":2.0,"arXiv251007926v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"remarkable performance":1.0,"a wide range":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7722546827777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.5839999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6832,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5427,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0393,"sadness":0.0671,"fear":0.1255,"anger":0.1159,"disgust":0.105},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the evaluation of LLMs for factual recall, which is a basic research area.
