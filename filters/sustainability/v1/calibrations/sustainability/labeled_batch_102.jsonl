{"id":"science_biorxiv_dee67a5c6c5c","title":"A single","content":"Statistical colocalization testing methods can determine if the same single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) underlies both a genome-wide association study (GWAS) locus as well as an expression quantitative trait (eQTL) locus. This can nominate potential mechanistic pathways from SNPs to genes to traits, while providing cell type or tissue context. Surprisingly, systematic colocalization testing with bulk-tissue eQTLs fails to link the majority of GWAS loci with gene expression changes. Mapping eQTLs with single-cell expression data has the potential to reveal the missing regulatory effects of GWAS variants. However, current pseudobulk cluster-based approaches may be underpowered when clustering accuracy is imperfect or with an incorrectly selected cluster resolution. To improve power of single-cell colocalization tests, we developed a cluster-free method, scJLIM. By modeling eQTL interactions with continuous cell states (e.g., principal components), scJLIM estimates eQTL significance and colocalization in individual cells. We benchmarked our method with simulated data, demonstrating improvements in power over pseudobulk methods. In our main applications, we used scJLIM to analyze blood and brain scRNA-seq datasets paired with autoimmune and neurological disease GWAS, respectively. We identified nearly twice as many total colocalizations compared with traditional pseudobulk analyses carried out within the major cell populations of these tissues. Aligning with a recent experimental study, we highlighted an example of the ETS2 gene colocalizing with an inflammatory bowel disease GWAS locus in a subset of myeloid cells. For Parkinson's disease (PD), our results pointed to TRPV2 as a potential gene of interest, corroborated by transcriptional changes in both post-mortem PD brains and iPSC-derived neuronal models of alpha-synucleinopathy.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681685v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.460592","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Mitchel, J., Nazeen, S., Wang, X., Patnaik, P.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_33891fd969ab","title":"Obesity Impairs the Antitumor Activity of CAR","content":"Background: We have reported that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting B7-H3 (B7-H3.CAR) are effective in a preclinical model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and have initiated a Phase I study to assess safety and efficacy. However, heterogeneous antigen expression and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) remain roadblocks for effective CAR-T cell therapy. In particular, obesity represents a negative prognostic factor in TNBC partly due to chronic inflammation and impaired adaptive immune responses. Hence, we sought to determine if obesity can affect the antitumor activity of B7-H3.CAR-T cells. Methods: We used qPCR and western blotting to determine if cytokines associated with obesity affect B7-H3 expression in TNBC cell lines. Furthermore, we used shRNA to suppress B7-H3 expression in a syngeneic orthotopic E0771 tumor model and measured tumor growth in control and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Finally, we evaluated the antitumor effects of B7-H3.CAR-T cells in both control and DIO mice orthotopically engrafted with the E0771 tumor cell line. Immune profiling was conducted using flow cytometry. Results: Obesity-related inflammatory cytokines promote B7-H3 expression in human and murine TNBC cells in vitro and B7-H3 expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness in vivo. CAR-T cells obtained from control or DIO mice were equally cytotoxic in vitro but activated T cells and B7-H3.CAR-T cells obtained from DIO mice show transcriptomic changes (enriched Tox2, Prdm1, Batf) and impaired glycolytic capacity, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that obesity impairs CAR-T cell antitumor effects and durability of response in vivo with a near complete loss of memory formation. Conclusions: Here we identified a correlation between B7-H3 expression, obesity, and rate of tumor growth in TNBC. Furthermore, we showed that obesity constrains both the ability of B7-H3.CAR-T cells to control tumor growth and to elicit durable immunological memory. Taken together, these data identify obesity as an underappreciated and potent modulator of CAR-T cell functionality.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681694v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.459063","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":305,"author":"Malian, H.

Here, we systematically investigate how variations in acyl chain length and unsaturation modulate the biophysical and electrostatic properties of zwitterionic lipid membranes. Using amphiphilic DNA nanoprobes as model charged biomolecules, we reveal how lipid packing, fluidity, and membrane phase collectively govern surface charge and interactions with nanoprobes, delineating relationships that persist in the presence of anionic lipids. We further demonstrate that the identity and hydrophobicity of membrane anchors in nanoprobes significantly influence binding, providing a means to modulate membrane association through programmable strategies. By establishing design principles that link acyl chain chemistry to surface charge and biomolecular attachment, our findings provide a mechanistic framework to engineer selective membrane interactions. Beyond their direct applicability to biomimetic platforms and synthetic cell engineering, these insights hold broad relevance to lipid-based vaccine nanotechnologies and the fundamental understanding of membrane-biomolecule interactions in living cells.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681803v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.459669","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Li, Y., Horton, N.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_f5ab6c1e51fa","title":"QuickStainer: a rapid negative staining device for improved preservation of molecular structure","content":"Negative staining is a widely used technique for observing macromolecules and their assemblies by transmission electron microscopy. It is commonly employed to optimize specimens for cryo-EM. The stain, typically a uranyl salt, surrounds the structure, providing an outline view at about 20 [A] resolution. Many macromolecules are relatively stable and rigid, and negative stain images provide a good representation of their structure. However, some are labile or flexible and their structure or assembly state is altered by binding to the carbon substrate on the grid before specimen staining. In these cases, the negatively stained appearance does not faithfully represent the structure in solution. This problem is reduced when samples are incubated on the carbon surface for short times (5 s) rather than typical times (30-60 s) before staining. To reduce disruption to a minimum, we have developed a rapid negative staining device (QuickStainer) using 3D-printed components, a stepper motor for precisely timed movements, and an Arduino-controlled interface to execute commands. QuickStainer produces consistent, reproducible results, achieving sample incubation times as low as 10 ms before staining. Tests show rapid adherence of molecules to the grid and greatly improved structural preservation of labile specimens compared with standard preparation protocols. The design of QuickStainer can accommodate inclusion of additional steps, such as timed incubation with enzyme substrate, before staining.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681814v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.459961","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Nguyen, V., Gautam, R., Somavarapu, A., Dutta, D., Patra, A., Ge, J., Yengo, C., Padron, R., Craig, R.","raw_content_length":1507,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1507,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["QuickStainer","a rapid negative staining device","improved preservation","molecular structure","their structure","Negative staining","a widely used technique","macromolecules","their assemblies","transmission electron microscopy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["QuickStainer"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"QuickStainer":2.0,"a rapid negative staining device":2.0,"improved preservation":2.0,"molecular structure":2.0,"their structure":2.0,"Negative staining":1.0,"a widely used technique":1.0,"macromolecules":1.0,"their assemblies":1.0,"transmission electron microscopy":1.0}},"age_hours":25.93608213,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8024,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.01,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0137,"anger":0.0202,"disgust":0.1438},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a new device (QuickStainer) for rapid negative staining in electron microscopy.

Growing evidence has identified associations between TR genes and immune-related diseases. Germline variants may influence TR gene function and subsequent usage, highlighting the importance of accurate TR allele profiling. However, accurately identifying germline TR from standard WGS data remains challenging due to short read lengths, limited depth, and high sequence similarity. To address these challenges, we developed gAIRR-wgs, for WGS-based TR allele typing. By incorporating novel alleles from HPRC individuals, gAIRR-wgs exhibited excellent performance in allele calling, with F1 scores of 100.0% for TR_D, 99.8% for TR_J, and 98.3% for TR_V. Applying this pipeline to 1,492 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), we identified 449 novel TR alleles, 277 of which overlapped with HPRC release 1 data of mixed ethnicity and are absent in the IMGT database. Further population comparison analysis revealed significant TR allele distribution differences across global populations, showing population-specific patterns and diversity variations between ethnic groups. We also discovered TWB-specific deletion polymorphisms affecting contiguous TRGV and TRBV genes, which are not recorded in the gnomAD database and undetected by standard structural variant callers, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to resolve complex immune gene regions. In conclusion, gAIRR-wgs enables accurate TR allele calling from standard WGS data using feasible computational resources and reveals substantial immunogenetic diversity in population cohorts.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681280v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.460273","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":235,"author":"Huang, K.-T., Yang, Y.-H., Lin, M.-J., Lai, S.-K., Chou, T.-H., Lee, C.-Y., Hung, T.-K., Hsu, C.-L., Yang, Y.-C., Chen, C.-Y., Chen, P.-L., Hsu, J.

Fibrosis in DMD is driven by sustained TGFbeta signaling, which promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. We previously showed that SETDB1 sustains the TGFbeta-induced fibrotic response in DMD myotubes. Here, we further show that SETDB1 modulates the TGFbeta-induced secretome, particularly by regulating ECM-related proteins. Comparison of the basal secretome from DMD patient-derived myotubes and healthy controls revealed a distinct disease-specific profile. Integrating both secretome analyses, we identified EMILIN1, an ECM glycoprotein not previously studied in skeletal muscle, as a robust shared candidate; EMILIN1 is enriched in the DMD secretome, further upregulated by TGFbeta and downregulated upon SETDB1 depletion. We confirmed EMILIN1 overexpression in DMD patient muscle biopsies, validating its pathological relevance. Functionally, EMILIN1 depletion modulated myogenic differentiation and reduced expression of the fibrotic marker SERPINE1. These findings establish EMILIN1 as a novel secreted regulator of myogenesis and fibrosis, and implicate SETDB1 in shaping the TGFbeta-dependent secretome in DMD.

While non-muscle myosin II (NM II) is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, whether it regulates IEC colonization by A/E pathogens is not known. To address this question, we targeted NM IIA and NM IIC, the NM II paralogs expressed in IECs. Our in vivo studies utilized mouse models with either intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of NM IIA (NM IIA cKO mice), expression of a NM IIA motor domain mutant, or total deletion of NM IIC (NM IIC tKO mice). In vitro experiments utilized IECs (HT-29cF8 and Caco-2BBE) with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of NM IIA or NM IIC. In addition, NM II activity in vitro was modulated pharmacologically, using either the pan-myosin inhibitor, blebbistatin, or a specific NM IIC activator, 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP). NM IIA cKO and NM IIA mutant mice demonstrated higher C. rodentium colonization along with more severe mucosal inflammation and colonic crypt hyperplasia as compared to their controls. By contrast, NM IIC tKO mice was indistinguishable from their control with regard to C. rodentium colonization. Blebbistatin treatment increased EPEC attachment to IECs monolayers, whereas 4-HAP did not affect bacterial attachment. Genetic knockout of NM IIA, but not NM IIC, increased EPEC adhesion to IEC monolayers. Importantly, the increase in EPEC attachment exhibited by NM IIA-deficient IECs required intact bacterial Type 3 secretion system and functional Tir effector, indicating that NM IIA functions in actin pedestal assembly. In summary, we describe a novel role for NM IIA in limiting intestinal epithelial colonization by A/E pathogens via inhibition of pathogen-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681730v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.461170","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":289,"author":"Naydenov, N.

However, little is known about the effects of the fatty acid synthesis pathway in macrophages on inflammation and cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). Using spatial metabolomics, here we show that cardiac macrophages residing in the infarct synthesize de novo fatty acids and increase the production of fatty acid enzymes including ACLY and FASN. Mice deficient in myeloid Acly and Fasn have improved cardiac function after MI and reduced fibrosis. Combining Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), RNA sequencing analysis of Acly-/- macrophages, and macrophage-specific in vivo gene silencing, we demonstrate that ACLY acetylates the promoter region of the upstream regulator Krt17, which drives the production of pro-fibrotic cytokines, including IL-33. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cardiac fibroblasts shows that the expansion of a population of fibroblasts (Fibroblast 5) expressing high levels of extracellular matrix genes after MI is confined in the absence of macrophage Acly. Finally, the analysis of spatial multi-omics data of human hearts with MI uncovers myofibroblasts with the Fibroblast 5 gene signature. These myofibroblasts are located near cardiac macrophages expressing high levels of ACLY. In summary, we show that macrophage ACLY and FASN are deleterious in MI pathogenesis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681697v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.461493","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Dutta, P., Sadaf, S., Vasamsetti, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_e3679f8d9ca1","title":"Bhlhe40 Coordinates T Cell Programs with Distinct CD4 and CD8 T Cell Requirements for Anti-PD-1 Versus Anti","content":"The transcriptional programs that enable CD4 and CD8 T cells to mediate effective anti-tumor immunity remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify distinct, therapy-specific roles for the transcriptional regulator Bhlhe40 in CD4 and CD8 T cells, revealing divergent requirements during anti-PD-1 versus anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Using conditional knockout mice, we show that anti-PD-1 efficacy depends on CD8 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40 and may also require its expression in CD4 T cells, whereas anti-CTLA-4 relies primarily on CD4 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40 and remains effective without Bhlhe40 in CD8 T cells. Loss of Bhlhe40 skews CD8 T cells toward TCF-1-expressing naive and progenitor exhausted-like states, particularly in the absence of ICT. Bhlhe40 sustains CD8 effector and exhausted phenotypes, promotes IFN{gamma} production, and supports glycolytic and mitochondrial programs, with Bhlhe40 deficiency leading to impaired glycolysis under either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 ICT, and reduced mitochondrial function primarily during anti-PD-1. In addition, CD8 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40 is required for full ICT-induced remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment from CX3CR1+; macrophages to iNOS+; macrophages. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 can drive tumor rejection and partial macrophage remodeling in the absence of CD8 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40, provided CD4 T cell function is intact. Analysis of human cancer datasets revealed that BHLHE40 is enriched in tumor-reactive and activated/exhausted CD8 T cells, where its expression is inversely correlated with TCF7 (TCF-1) and positively associated with TOX and IFNG. Moreover, subsets of CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of BHLHE40 in basal and squamous cell carcinoma responders compared with non-responders. Together, these findings establish Bhlhe40 not only as a transcriptional coordinator of T cell effector programs and metabolic fitness, but also as a therapy-specific, subset-dependent determinant of ICT efficacy, providing a mechanistic basis for the divergent modes of action of anti-PD-1 versus anti-CTLA-4.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681497v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.461804","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":291,"author":"Saha, A., Minowa, T., Shavkunov, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_fd21851d0f8c","title":"A cluster of three snoRNAs including jouvence required in the gut determines lifespan and confers neuroprotection through metabolic parameters","content":"In our society, the aging of the population is a major concern of public health. Recently we have identified a new snoRNA (jouvence) in Drosophila, and showed that its deletion (F4) reduces lifespan, while its overexpression increases it. F4 deleted flies also present neurodegenerative lesions and a deregulation of metabolic parameters as triglycerides and sterol. However, a deeper characterization of this genomic locus has revealed the presence of two other snoRNAs. Here, we have characterized at the whole organismal level, the role of each them. First, we show that each snoRNAs are expressed in the epithelium of the gut (enterocytes), and in the fat body. Second, in F4 deletion, the re-expression of each snoRNA in the enterocytes or in the fat body is sufficient to improve lifespan, and protect against neurodegeneration in old flies. In addition, depending of the snoRNAs, it rescues the expression of specific deregulated genes within the epithelium of the gut, involved in lipids and sterol metabolism. Consequently, these two metabolic parameters are also rescued, establishing a relationship between the lesions of the brain, the metabolic disorders, the lifespan, and each snoRNAs respectively. Finally, histological stainings as Nile Red and BODIPY C11-581/591 have revealed that the neurodegenerative lesions are due to an increase of free sterol within the brain, and lipid peroxydation in the pericerebral fat body. Altogether, these results point-out a causal relationship between the epithelium of the gut and the neurodegenerative lesions through the metabolic parameters, indicating a gut-brain axis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681784v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.462093","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Al Issa, S., Gauvrit, T., Daira, P., Bernoud-Hubac, N., MARTIN, J.-R.","raw_content_length":1627,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Drosophila"],"persons":["snoRNA"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1627,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["jouvence","lifespan","metabolic parameters","A cluster","three snoRNAs","the gut","neuroprotection","our society","the aging","the population"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"jouvence":3.0,"lifespan":3.0,"metabolic parameters":3.0,"A cluster":2.0,"three snoRNAs":2.0,"the gut":2.0,"neuroprotection":2.0,"our society":1.0,"the aging":1.0,"the population":1.0}},"age_hours":25.936188261111113,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7447,"joy":0.0044,"surprise":0.0125,"sadness":0.051,"fear":0.047,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.12},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on snoRNAs in Drosophila and their impact on lifespan and neurodegeneration.

Gut microbiota-mediated recycling of urea-nitrogen into AAs has long been considered a mechanism to assist in conserving nitrogen; however, the relevance of urea nitrogen salvage (UNS) to overall host physiology and metabolism is debated. We hypothesized that incorporation of microbially-liberated urea-nitrogen (MLUN) into AAs would be higher in host tissues of hibernating arctic ground squirrels compared to those of summer active squirrels, and that MLUN would support synthesis of anabolic AAs that regulate protein balance. To test this, we injected [13C, 15N2]-urea into summer squirrels and into squirrels hibernating at an ecologically relevant ambient temperature (-16 C). We found greater incorporation of MLUN into non-essential AAs and specific essential AAs in several tissues of hibernating squirrels compared to summer. We also observed increased 15N enrichment in leucine-isoleucine, citrulline and glutamine, anabolic AAs known to influence protein balance and trans-organ nitrogen balance. Compared to studies in which ground squirrels hibernated at ambient temperatures above 0 C, our results suggest that squirrels hibernating at subzero temperatures may up modulate synthesis of AAs that preserve protein and nitrogen balance during prolonged fasting and inactivity.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681026v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.462739","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Rice, S., Grond, K., Gering, S.

However, such quantitative cell-fate data is available for a few systems only; instead, gene regulatory networks dynamics have been studied for a broader set of biological decision-making scenarios. Thus, connecting the geometry of cell-fate decisions to their underlying regulatory networks remains an open question. Recently, two regulatory networks have been shown to exhibit tristability -- a toggle switch with self-activation, and a toggle triad. Here, we show that these two motifs are distinct from a geometrical point of view, and identify two bifurcations in their behaviour: the standard cusp and the elliptic umbillic. We study experimentally accessible signatures of the differences in tristability between the two motifs. We also show how the standard cusp can be used to quantitatively model cell fate transition data for the Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition on TGF-{beta} induction in the context of cancer cells. Our work uncovers geometrical signatures of gene regulatory motifs and demonstrates how different gene regulatory networks can encode tristability in dynamically distinct ways.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681792v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.463004","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Duddu, A.

Avocado (Persea americana) is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, phytosterols, and antioxidants, yet its integrative impact on hypertension-induced systemic injury has not been fully explored. Methods Male Wistar rats (n = 4/group) were randomized into six groups: control, avocado, L-NAME, L-NAME+losartan+metaprolol succinate, L-NAME+avocado, and L-NAME+metaprolol succinate+avocado. Avocado pulp was incorporated into diet at 80% w/w. Endpoints included blood pressure indices, hematological parameters, liver enzymes, renal function tests, and correlation analyses of systolic-diastolic coupling. One-way ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc tests evaluated group differences, while forest plots and scatter analyses visualized treatment effects. Results L-NAME significantly elevated systolic blood pressure ({Delta}+18 mmHg), diastolic pressure ({Delta}+20 mmHg), and mean arterial pressure ({Delta}+17 mmHg; all p < 0.01) compared with controls. Avocado supplementation reduced these elevations by ~15-18 mmHg, restoring values near baseline. L-NAME increased platelet counts (p = 0.031) and trended toward leukocytosis, both of which were attenuated by avocado. ALT levels were higher in L-NAME rats (p = 0.044), while AST and ALP trended upward; avocado-fed groups maintained near-control enzyme levels. Renal markers were most affected: urea (+25 mg/dl) and creatinine (+0.8 mg/dl) rose significantly in L-NAME rats (p < 0.01), but were reduced by 20-30% with avocado supplementation. Electrolytes remained unchanged. Correlation analyses revealed pathological SBP-DBP coupling in L-NAME rats (r = 0.78), abolished by avocado (r = 0.00). Conclusion Avocado supplementation mitigates L-NAME-induced hypertension and systemic injury by stabilizing blood pressure, reducing thrombocytosis, and preserving hepatic and renal function.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_e878012073c7","title":"CSF1R inhibitors pexidartinib and sotuletinib induce rapid glial ablation despite their limited brain penetrability","content":"Background: Microglial reactivity, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, is thought to contribute significantly to disease pathology. In experimental models, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors transiently deplete microglia to resolve inflammation , leading to improved neuropathology. In oncology, CSF1R inhibitors modulate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward a tumor-suppressive phenotype by silencing CSF1-CSF1R signaling. As for any therapeutic, target engagement depends on effective drug delivery. In the brain a major hurdle is the limited drug delivery caused by the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB) containing drug efflux transporters. However, the affinity to these transporters of most CSF1R inhibitors is unknown. Methods: We assessed the brain penetrance of two CSF1R inhibitors, pexidartinib (PLX3397) and sotuletinib (BLZ945), in the absence and presence of drug transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2. We further assessed their impact on peripheral immune populations, tissue-resident macrophages, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Results: Both compounds have a limited brain permeability (brain-to-plasma ratio: 0.1). Sotuletinib was a substrate for both ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas pexidartinib was transported primarily by ABCB1. Despite low brain exposure, both are able to ablate microglia when given to mice at high doses, accompanied by marked depletion of OPCs and macrophage populations in the liver, intestine, and kidney, as well as non-classical monocytes in blood. Pexidartinib additionally altered splenic immune composition, increasing T cells and neutrophils, and reducing dendritic cells and non-classical monocytes. Conclusion: These findings highlight that high-dose CSF1R inhibition rapidly depletes microglia, but induces substantial off-target effects. Such systemic impacts, as well as the impact on OPCs, should be considered when interpreting experimental outcomes or translating CSF1R inhibition into clinical contexts where brain targeting is required.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681780v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.463926","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"van Tellingen, O., Tolboom, Z.

Here, we introduce DeviceAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent that integrates large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and domain-specific computational tools into a unified framework for bioelectronics research. Leveraging the emergent reasoning abilities of LLMs and VLMs, DeviceAgent enables zero and few-shot generalization, contextual learning, and flexible task execution across modalities. A multimodal context memory system orchestrates these capabilities, providing end-to-end support across the experimental pipeline, from high-level design objectives to fabrication protocol generation, visual defect inspection, and electrophysiological signal analysis, while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points. We demonstrate its capabilities through the development of stretchable mesh electronics for interfacing with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), a representative application involving complex device architectures, heterogeneous material nanofabrication, and electrophysiology analysis. DeviceAgent autonomously (1) generates customized bioelectronic layouts; (2) creates comprehensive fabrication protocols tailored to specific materials and processes; (3) identifies microscopic defects using visual reasoning; and (4) analyzes cardiac electrophysiological recordings in an interpretable manner.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_72c9e6909b00","title":"Polygenic basis of incipient reproductive isolation in hybridizing populations is revealed by pangenomic and epigenetic divergence","content":"Incipient reproductive isolation in the presence of gene flow has traditionally been attributed to a small number of major-effect loci under strong selection, representing only a minor fraction of the genome. Using the Heliconius erato adaptive radiation, a butterfly species with populations at varying levels of genetic differentiation ,we employed a pan-genome approach to investigate genome-wide mutational divergence, epigenetic changes, and structural variation contributing to divergence. In contrast to earlier studies that identified only a few highly divergent loci, our high-resolution analysis reveals widespread divergence across the genome, suggesting polygenic barriers to gene flow. Epigenetic divergence assessed using ATAC-seq, highlights population-specific differences in chromatin accessibility, which may reflect SNPs distribution or precede genetic differentiation by reshaping regulatory landscapes. We also identified new structural variants, including polymorphic indels in open chromatin, that further associate with genomic divergence. Together, these findings show that the genomic landscape of H. erato is shaped by a dynamic interplay of mutational changes, epigenetic modifications, and structural variation. We emphasize the role of developmental, behavioral, and ecological adaptations and provide a broader perspective on the functional genetic basis of genome-wide divergence in Heliconius. This emerging polygenic framework offers a more detailed understanding of how reproductive barriers evolve under ongoing gene flow.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681778v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.465205","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Ruggieri, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_5882bfe4eeb7","title":"Phylogenomic analyses of the diverse desert","content":"Deserts and alpine habitats, though ecologically distinct, share similar environmental stressors such as drought and high radiation. Various plant lineages traverse both biomes, which is often associated with transitions in life history strategy, where annuality is more often associated with drier desert habitats and perenniality more common in higher elevations. One such lineage is Cistantheae (Montiaceae), a morphologically diverse herbaceous clade in western North and South America. We aimed to infer a robust phylogeny of the clade as a foundation for taxonomic and comparative work. We used double-digest RADSeq to generate reduced-representation genomic data from over 160 samples representing 48 putative species in Cistantheae. Maximum likelihood and coalescent-based phylogenetic methods were utilized to infer evolutionary relationships across the full clade and within major subclades. We tested for signatures of admixture and introgressive gene flow, and reconstructed ancestral life history and climate niche to identify patterns of correlated evolution. We inferred a well-resolved phylogeny of Cistantheae, providing strong support for relationships among subclades within Cistantheae. While many species relationships were clarified, we also found evidence of rampant gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting, particularly within the annual Cistanthe clade from the Atacama Desert. Life history is evolutionarily labile across the clade, and was strongly correlated with temperature/precipitation-related bioclimatic variables: annuals tend to occur in hotter, drier environments, while perennials in cooler, wetter. Elevational range was also evolutionarily labile, with several species occupying broad elevational gradients. We present the first densely-sampled, phylogenomic analysis of Cistantheae, providing key insights into species relationships in the clade. Repeated transitions in life history and climate niche, alongside wide elevational ranges, suggest that many Cistantheae species may be preadapted to both arid and montane habitats. This phylogeny will underpin further comparative, taxonomic, and phylogenomic studies in this ecologically important lineage.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.680062v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.465623","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":293,"author":"Chomentowska, A., Dauerman, S.

Investigating infection patterns in related host species across elevational gradients can reveal whether parasites and hosts show concordant patterns of elevational turnover, potentially due to shared historical and ecological factors. Here, we assessed patterns of elevational replacement in haemosporidian parasite assemblages that infect three congeneric songbird species: Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii), Gray Vireo (V. vicinior), and Plumbeous Vireo (V. plumbeus), each of which breeds across distinct elevations and habitats in the southwestern United States. We screened a total of 248 individuals using cytochrome b PCR and microscopy. We identified 19 haemosporidian haplotypes, including eight novel lineages. We found that each of the three vireo species exhibited high haemosporidian prevalence (55.0 to 86.2%), with nearly all infections from the genus Haemoproteus (subgenus Parahaemoproteus). Haemosporidian assemblages varied across elevations; each sampled range of elevations harbored abundant, yet host-specific lineages with different environmental associations. Bell's and Plumbeous Vireos, but not Gray Vireos, hosted several phylogenetically distinct, putative generalist lineages, likely reflecting spillover from more diverse local breeding bird communities. Repeated infections in individuals across breeding seasons, together with moderate parasitemia (mean ~1%) suggest that these focal vireo species harbor chronic infections during their respective breeding seasons. These results demonstrate that elevational replacement patterns in avian hosts may be mirrored by their haemosporidian parasites, particularly among host-specialized lineages.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681729v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.465914","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Wiley, D.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_7bd5efc4749e","title":"Plant diversity and water regime have distinct effects on soil fungal communities that are linked to plant productivity","content":"The soil microbiome both shapes and is shaped by the ecological consequences of drought and plant diversity loss. Sequencing soil fungal communities in a biodiversity experiment, we found that water addition, plant species richness, and plant phylogenetic diversity all impacted soil fungal composition, and increased the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) richness in particular. The richness of different fungal functional guilds all increased with plant functional trait diversity but were related to different above- and below-ground plant functional traits - AMF richness was negatively associated with root traits that indicate mycorrhizal dependence, whereas diverse soil pathogens generally co-occurred with plant traits linked to faster life histories. Unexpectedly, the effect of plant diversity loss on fungal diversity did not interact with the effects of either the watering treatment or the community weighted mean of plant traits. Shifts in AMF richness and soil fungal taxa due to plant diversity loss were further associated with reduced plant productivity and diversity effects. Overall, our results indicate that changes in water input and loss in plant taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity can negatively impact soil fungal communities, and through changes in soil microbiome, may also reduce plant productivity. This negative effect of plant diversity loss is consistent across water regimes and plant community-level traits, suggesting a general vulnerability of soil microbiome and ecosystem productivity towards the biodiversity crisis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.680786v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.466190","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Yan, X., Bowman, E.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_81f3a30b858d","title":"Bacterial exposure drives immune ageing","content":"The immune system is uniquely capable of both regenerating and ageing the rest of the organism based on its own state. Understanding the driving forces behind alterations in the immune system with age has thus potential to lead to interventions against ageing in general. However, the factors driving immune ageing remain largely unknown. Here we show that alterations in response to bacterial exposure are a key driving force of immune ageing. Studying a longitudinal cohort with their immune system characterised in high-dimension, we devised a phenotype-driven gene co-regulation analysis through which we unravel the immune-ageing role for multiple cellular functions, including genes regulated by miRNAs previously reported to cause gut leakiness. Hypothesizing increased bacterial exposure as a driver of immune ageing, we quantified the exposure of each individual's immune system to bacteria through analysing the residual bacterial DNA content in their immune cells. We found that the total bacterial load is unrelated to the subject's chronological or immune age, but predicts the change in immune age over the next year. Finally, we rationalise previously observed alterations in cellular composition of the immune system associated with ageing by finding that the immune cell subtypes most increasing in their frequency are highly enriched in expressing bacterial response genes. Our results thus earmark bacterial exposure as the candidate driver to be counteracted in anti-ageing interventions and the immune cell residual bacterial DNA content as a biomarker for the immune systems most at risk of ageing. Overall, these results offer a new paradigm for investigating gut health in the context of ageing.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681722v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.466498","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Feldman, E., Hruzik, M., Lukacisin, M., Shen-Orr, S.

However, the core temperature threshold that triggers sex-specific leukocyte and neutrophil activation during passive heat stress remains undefined. Methods: We studied 52 males and 58 females exposed to wet-bulb temperatures of 32-35 {degrees}C. Rectal temperature (Trec) was continuously monitored, and blood samples were collected at 0.5 {degrees}C increments up to 38.6 {degrees}C. Leukocyte and neutrophil counts were modeled using quadratic and segmented regression to identify inflection points of immune activation. Results: Both leukocytes and neutrophils increased nonlinearly with rising Trec (p < 0.05). A critical Trec of 38.1 {degrees}C-closely aligns with the 38.0 {degrees}C occupational core temperature limits-marked an inflection in leukocyte responses: below this point, females showed steeper increases; whereas above it, males showed accelerated activation. Neutrophils demonstrated consistently greater mobilization in males across the entire temperature range (36.9-38.6 {degrees}C). Conclusions: A distinct core temperature threshold (~38.1 {degrees}C) governs immune cell activation and reveals sex-dependent response patterns. This finding provides an immunological rationale for current occupational het limits and highlights the importance of integrating sex-specific considerations into protective guidelines under extreme heat.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681783v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.466776","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Wei, B., Xu, Y., Wang, H., Wang, F.","raw_content_length":1471,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Leukocyte","Trec"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1471,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Critical Rectal Temperature Defines Sex","Prolonged heat exposure disrupts","acute systemic inflammation","the core temperature threshold","sex-specific leukocyte and neutrophil activation","passive heat stress","52 males","58 females","wet-bulb temperatures","32-35 degreesC Rectal temperature"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Critical Rectal Temperature Defines Sex":2.0,"Prolonged heat exposure disrupts":1.0,"acute systemic inflammation":1.0,"the core temperature threshold":1.0,"sex-specific leukocyte and neutrophil activation":1.0,"passive heat stress":1.0,"52 males":1.0,"58 females":1.0,"wet-bulb temperatures":1.0,"32-35 degreesC Rectal temperature":1.0}},"age_hours":25.9364162725,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7578,"joy":0.0025,"surprise":0.0137,"sadness":0.032,"fear":0.0397,"anger":0.0548,"disgust":0.0996},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies a critical core temperature threshold affecting immune cell activation, revealing sex-dependent responses to heat stress.

Oligomeric amyloid-{beta}, rather than monomeric or fibrillar amyloid-{beta}, has been proposed to be the proximate mechanistic cause, but the relevant molecular characteristics have remained unclear. Here, we define a distinct receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} pool in Alzheimers brain by release with a receptor antagonist and purification to homogeneity. Receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} is ten times more abundant than free unbound amyloid-{beta}. The amyloid-{beta} associated with receptor is composed of 65 nm long filaments with prion protein binding at its tips. There is no evidence for an oligomeric A{beta} state interacting with human brain receptors. Cryo-electron microscopy shows two symmetric S-shaped monomers per filament rung. The tilt between rung monomers, twist along the filament axis, amino terminal conformation and amyloid seeding properties distinguish this structure from plaque-associated amyloid-{beta} filaments of the same brain. High tip:length ratio is critical for prion protein receptor interaction and synaptic damage. Characterizing receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} filament provides insight into neuronal dysfunction separate from plaque aggregation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681740v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:51:03.467308","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Kostylev, M.

Viral tracers are powerful vehicles for comprehending the complex relationship between neurons and astrocytes. Despite adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) based anterograde trans-neuronal tools have been successfully applied for identifying astrocytes connected with presynaptic neurons, analogous retrograde trans-neuronal tools for labeling astrocytes connected to postsynaptic neurons remain under development. Here, we first demonstrate that GfaABC1D promoter embedding AAV11 can transfer retrogradely from axons of postsynaptic neurons to astrocytes. Furthermore, we established an AAV11-based dual-viral recombination strategy for labeling astrocytes connected to specific postsynaptic neurons. Finally, by employing targeted neuronal ablation technology to ablate neurons in a specific brain region, we observed that injection of AAV11 into the downstream brain region of this targeted area exhibited minimal labeling of astrocytes functionally associated with the ablated neurons. This finding indicates that AAV11 holds utility for deciphering pathological alterations in disease-related astrocyte-neuron connectivity networks.

{"id":"ai_engadget_e88a4ff87a20","title":"GM ends development of hydrogen fuel cells","content":"In a bulletin on Friday, GM announced that it will end its HYDROTEC brand's work on hydrogen fuel cell development. Instead, GM will focus its R&D efforts on batteries, charging technologies and electric vehicles. The company said it will continue its Fuel Cell System Manufacturing joint venture with Honda, which creates cells for data centers and power generation. The post from GM said that due to limited infrastructure and high costs, hydrogen cells simply haven't taken off for consumer vehicles. Lately, the automotive industry seems to agree. GM's shift follows a similar move in February from Toyota, which isn't completely giving up the ghost but instead pivoted its hydrogen cell projects to focus on industrial applications rather than consumer ones.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_15899a4e03d7","title":"Metro Mattress is closing stores and winding down operations: See the list of locations that will shutter","content":"Thirteen months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Metro Mattress Corp. is set to become the latest brick-and-mortar chain to wind down operations in 2025. The New York-based bedding retailer has disclosed in a court filing that it plans to shutter its remaining stores after some 21 attempts to find a buyer or strategic partner that would have allowed it to continue. Headquartered in Syracuse, Metro Mattress had 70 locations across New York and four New England states when it sought Chapter 11 protection in September 2024. At the time, the company said it planned to close roughly two dozen of those stores and refocus its efforts specifically on its New York locations. It eventually closed 30 stores, including all of its locations in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, in addition to some underperforming stores in New York. CEO Dino Cifelli, a furniture retail veteran who had been hired only six months earlier to execute a growth strategy at Metro Mattress, noted in his initial court declaration that the New England stores faced various existential headwinds, including higher operating costs and “inefficiencies of scale.” Shedding the New England locations, Cifelli added, would help Metro Mattress return to profitability and “result in a sustainable business.” But things haven’t turned out that way, in part due to low foot traffic, and now the retailer says it will close all of its remaining stores. In a court filing in early October, Metro Mattress said it will transfer most of its inventory to five or six locations and conduct going-out-of-business sales, with the spaces being returned to landlords after a roughly five-week liquidation period. Which Metro Mattress locations are closing? All remaining Metro Mattress locations are expected to close, and in fact, many already have. The company has not confirmed which stores will remain open to conduct the liquidation sales. Emails to Metro Mattress went unreturned, and a representative declined to comment to Fast Company when reached by phone. According to its store locator tool, the following seven locations appear to still be open as of Monday, October 13: Metro Mattress Albany Metro Mattress John Glenn Blvd.: Syracuse, NY Metro Mattress Syracuse: Dewitt, NY Metro Mattress Irondequoit: Rochester, NY Metro Mattress Greece: Rochester, NY Metro Mattress Amherst Metro Mattress Glenmont In court documents, Metro Mattress has identified the following 40 stores across New York state that will shutter as part of its wind-down process: Metro Mattress Amherst: Tonawanda, NY Metro Mattress Horseheads: Horseheads, NY Metro Mattress Irondequoit: Irondequoit, NY Metro Mattress Greece: Rochester, NY Metro Mattress Olean: Olean, NY Metro Mattress Glenmont: Glenmont, NY Metro Mattress John Glenn: Syracuse, NY Metro Mattress Wolf Road: Albany, NY 12205 Metro Mattress Hamburg: Hamburg, NY Metro Mattress Utica: Yorkville, NY Metro Mattress Batavia: Batavia, NY Metro Mattress Lansing: Ithaca, NY Metro Mattress Lockport: Lockport, NY Metro Mattress Geneseo: Geneseo, NY Metro Mattress Auburn: Auburn, NY Metro Mattress Liverpool: Liverpool, NY Metro Mattress Watertown: Watertown, NY Metro Mattress Union Road: Cheektowaga, NY Metro Mattress Clifton Park: Clifton Park, NY Metro Mattress Delaware: Buffalo, NY Metro Mattress New Hartford: New Hartford, NY Metro Mattress Niagara Falls: Niagara Falls, NY Metro Mattress East Dewitt: Syracuse, NY Metro Mattress Geneva: Geneva, NY Metro Mattress Niskayuna: Niskayuna, NY Metro Mattress Johnson City: Johnson City, NY Metro Mattress Johnstown: Johnstown, NY Metro Mattress Oswego: Oswego, NY Metro Mattress Norwich: Norwich, NY Metro Mattress Wilton: Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 Metro Mattress Cortland: Cortland, NY Metro Mattress Oneonta: Oneonta, NY Metro Mattress Vestal: Vestal, NY Metro Mattress West Fairmount: Syracuse, NY Metro Mattress Henrietta: Rochester, NY Metro Mattress Ithaca: Ithaca, NY Metro Mattress Canandaigua: Canandaigua, NY Metro Mattress North Cicero: Cicero, NY Metro Mattress Rome: Rome, NY Metro Mattress Webster: Webster, NY Retail closures pile up in 2025 Metro Mattress joins a number of well-known retail chains that have ceased operations after seeking bankruptcy protection over the last 18 months.

But smaller and mid-size chains are obviously not immune to the same unfavorable forces that have plagued so many retail businesses in recent years—including soaring operating costs, consumers with less money to spend, and the broader shift to online shopping.","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91421315/metro-mattress-store-closures-full-list-locations-liquidation-sales","published_date":"2025-10-13T19:55:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T01:52:32.468692","language":"en","tags":["business","technology","news","innovation"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":709,"author":"Christopher Zara","raw_content_length":6416,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.545,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Metro Mattress","Metro Mattress Corp."],"persons":["Dino Cifelli"],"locations":["Massachusetts","New Hampshire","Rhode Island","New York","Connecticut","Syracuse","New England"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4707,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Metro Mattress","closing stores","winding down operations","the list","locations","Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection","Metro Mattress Corp","the latest brick-and-mortar chain","operations","The New York-based bedding retailer"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the latest brick-and-mortar chain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Metro Mattress":3.0,"closing stores":2.0,"winding down operations":2.0,"the list":2.0,"locations":2.0,"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection":1.0,"Metro Mattress Corp":1.0,"the latest brick-and-mortar chain":1.0,"operations":1.0,"The New York-based bedding retailer":1.0}},"age_hours":6.021940899722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0417,"joy":0.0032,"surprise":0.0157,"sadness":0.9091,"fear":0.0107,"anger":0.0102,"disgust":0.0094},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the closure of a retail chain, Metro Mattress.
