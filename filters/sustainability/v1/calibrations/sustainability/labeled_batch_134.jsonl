The development of advanced image reconstruction methods for transcranial PACT is hindered by the lack of well-characterized, clinically relevant evaluation frameworks. Virtual imaging studies offer a solution, but require realistic numerical phantoms. To address this need, this study introduces a framework for generating ensembles of realistic 3D numerical head phantoms for virtual imaging studies. The framework uses adjunct CT data to create anatomical phantoms, which are then enhanced with stochastically synthesized vasculature and assigned realistic optical and acoustic-elastic properties. The utility of the framework is demonstrated through a case study on the impact of skull modeling errors on transcranial PACT image quality. By allowing researchers to assess and refine reconstruction methods meaningfully, the presented framework is expected to accelerate the development of transcranial PACT.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09758","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.616325","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsmed-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Hsuan-Kai Huang, Joseph Kuo, Seonyeong Park, Umberto Villa, Lihong V.

Yet achieving spatially selective, low-voltage control in thin films and quantifying ME coupling across the full ferroelastic loop remains challenging. Here, we investigate sub-micrometer Ni/BPZT thin-film devices with laterally patterned gates that localize in-plane strain beneath the Ni stripe and modulate its magnetization. We use anisotropic magnetoresistance to measure magnetization changes across the ferroelastic loop under different magnetic bias fields. Combined with Multiphysics strain simulations and micromagnetic modeling, this provides a quantitative framework that captures the convolution of ferroelastic and magnetoelastic nonlinearities and provides critical insight for device design, while enabling multi-state, bias-field-free magnetization control for non-conventional computing. The extracted coupling coefficient in linear range is 1.3 mT/V across a 700 nm gap, with a clear pathway to improving voltage efficiency through device scaling, establishing a scalable CMOS-compatible platform for energy-efficient spintronic devices.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09795","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.617138","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsapp-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Fanfan Meng, Emma Van Meirvenne, Federica Luciano, Xiangyu Wu, Yves Deblock, Kaustuv Banerjee, Peter Rickhaus, Florin Ciubotaru, Christoph Adelmann","raw_content_length":1258,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1257,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nonlinear Strain-Mediated Magnetoelectric Coupling","Sub","arXiv251009795v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Strain-mediated magnetoelectric ME heterostructures","electric-field control","magnetism","ultra-low-power spintronic logic","spatially selective low-voltage control","thin films"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Nonlinear Strain-Mediated Magnetoelectric Coupling"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nonlinear Strain-Mediated Magnetoelectric Coupling":2.0,"Sub":2.0,"arXiv251009795v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Strain-mediated magnetoelectric ME heterostructures":1.0,"electric-field control":1.0,"magnetism":1.0,"ultra-low-power spintronic logic":1.0,"spatially selective low-voltage control":1.0,"thin films":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7738896319444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8544,"joy":0.0224,"surprise":0.0717,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0188,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes research on a novel magnetoelectric device for low-power spintronics.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_311a38f39ae2","title":"Enhancement of diffusivity and plastic deformation in ultrasound","content":"arXiv:2510.09803v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Tungsten ($W$) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$ using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic deformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting grain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy formation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$ substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for fabricating uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of refractory metals.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09803","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.617580","language":"en","tags":["physicsatom-ph","physicscomp-ph","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Md Tusher Ahmed, Farid Ahmed, Jianzhi Li","raw_content_length":1725,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1724,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Enhancement","diffusivity and plastic deformation","ultrasound","arXiv251009803v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Tungsten","its exceptional thermal stability","mechanical strength","corrosion resistance"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Enhancement":2.0,"diffusivity and plastic deformation":2.0,"ultrasound":2.0,"arXiv251009803v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Tungsten":1.0,"its exceptional thermal stability":1.0,"mechanical strength":1.0,"corrosion resistance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7739047988888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7586,"joy":0.0132,"surprise":0.0144,"sadness":0.0108,"fear":0.1159,"anger":0.0457,"disgust":0.0415},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents atomistic simulations showing that ultrasound perturbation enhances self-diffusivity and plastic deformation in tungsten during cold spray additive manufacturing.

CuPyMag solves micromagnetics with finite elements in a GPU-resident workflow in which key operations, such as right-hand-side assembly, spatial derivatives, and volume averages, are tensorized using CuPy's BLAS-accelerated backend. Benchmark tests show that the GPU solvers in CuPyMag achieve a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude compared to the CPU codes. Its runtime grows linearly/sublinearly with problem size, demonstrating high efficiency. Additionally, CuPyMag uses the Gauss-Seidel projection method for time integration, which not only allows stable time steps (up to 11 ps) but also solves each governing equation with only 1-3 conjugate-gradient iterations without preconditioning. CuPyMag accounts for magnetoelastic coupling and far-field effects arising from the boundary of the magnetic body, both of which play an important role in magnetization reversal in the presence of local defects. CuPyMag solves these computationally intensive multiphysics simulations with a high-resolution mesh (up to 3M nodes) in under three hours on an NVIDIA H200 GPU. This acceleration enables micromagnetic simulations with non-trivial defect geometries and resolves nanoscale magnetic structures. It expands the scope of micromagnetic simulations towards realistic, large-scale problems that can guide experiments. More broadly, CuPyMag is developed using widely adopted Python libraries, which provide cross-platform compatibility, ease of installation, and accessibility for adaptations to diverse applications.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09812","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.618006","language":"en","tags":["physics","research","preprints","physicscomp-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Hongyi Guan, Ananya Renuka Balakrishna","raw_content_length":1695,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Gauss-Seidel","CPU","CuPy","GPU"],"persons":["Benchmark","CuPyMag"],"locations":["CuPyMag"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1694,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CuPyMag","CuPyMag GPU","arXiv251009812v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","an open-source","Python-based framework","large-scale micromagnetic simulations","magnetostriction","micromagnetics","finite elements"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CuPyMag":3.0,"CuPyMag GPU":2.0,"arXiv251009812v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"an open-source":1.0,"Python-based framework":1.0,"large-scale micromagnetic simulations":1.0,"magnetostriction":1.0,"micromagnetics":1.0,"finite elements":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7739203341666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9109,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.03,"sadness":0.0026,"fear":0.0136,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"CuPyMag accelerates micromagnetic simulations, potentially leading to more efficient design of magnetic materials used in various technologies.

Accurate and detailed kinetic models are critical for designing optimal burners and engines. Despite numerous mechanisms published in recent years, large discrepancies remain between model predictions and experimental data, particularly for NOx species. In this work, we have reviewed the literature to obtain the most up-to-date and reliable thermochemical and kinetic parameters for most reactions present in ammonia combustion, and for reactions for which these parameters are not available, we performed high-level calculations to determine them. The purpose of this was to minimize the number of estimated parameters used in model development. A new, detailed kinetic mechanism was then generated with the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG). To ensure physical consistency, geometry optimizations were carried out for all hypothesized 'edge' species, and any non-convergent or non-physical structures were excluded. The resulting mechanism was tested against experimental laminar burning velocities, ignition delay time, flow reactor species profiles, and jet-stirred reactor data, and compared with five recent representative mechanisms. Recently developed bath-gas-mixture rules were applied to a number of key reactions in the mechanism, and we found this to result in better agreement with experiment for a number of modeling targets. While the mechanism does not reproduce all experimental results, it demonstrates improved robustness without parameter tuning, thereby reducing the risk of over-fitting and enhancing predictive reliability under conditions relevant to practical applications.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09860","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.619245","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicschem-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Yu-Chi Kao, Anna C.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_af8c2278d303","title":"Modelling Intra-driver Behavioral Adaptation through Risk Sensitivity and Regime Transitions: A Task","content":"arXiv:2510.09886v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been a growing trend toward integrating human factors (HF) into traffic flow models to better understand the complexities of human behavior and its impact on traffic dynamics. This research seeks to advance this trend by bridging the gap between traditional car-following models and the inherent variability of human driving behavior. By incorporating these elements, our models provide valuable insights into how driver behavior adaptation and risk-taking influence traffic flow dynamics. Specifically, the study proposes a model called Intelligent Driver Model Task Saturation that integrates human behavioral adaptations and risk-taking strategies into a modified version of the established Intelligent Driver Model, enriched by a cognitive layer based on Fuller's Task Capability Interface model. This amalgamation offers a perspective on the interplay between driver behavior adaptation when the driving task saturates and the risk-taking strategy of drivers. When total task demand exceeds task capacity, drivers may adapt their behaviors in accordance with Fuller's risk allostasis theory, aiming to mitigate risk to acceptable levels. The model was calibrated utilizing data from driving simulator scenarios involving both normal and distracted driving and naturalistic data, ensuring its sensitivity to diverse driving behaviors and adaptive behavioral changes.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_6a156009b773","title":"Top","content":"arXiv:2510.09896v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Earth's energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere is a key climate system metric, but its variability is poorly constrained by the short observational record and large uncertainty in coupled climate models. While existing ocean heat content reconstructions offer a longer perspective, they cannot separate the contributions of shortwave and longwave radiation, obscuring the underlying processes. We extend the energy budget record by reconstructing the top-of-atmosphere radiation and related surface variables over the last millennium (850--2000 CE). Our method combines proxy data and model dynamics using seasonal, gridded data assimilation, exploiting the covariance of radiation with proxies sensitive to surface temperatures. The method validates well in a pseudoproxy experiment and against instrumental observations. We find that a last-millennium cooling trend coincides with heat loss that gradually slowed, although there are intermittent multidecadal periods of energy gain. The cooling trend is associated with a southwestward shift of Indo--Pacific convection and growth of sea ice, with seasonal sea ice trends following orbital-scale changes in polar insolation. We also find that the upper-ocean heat content following large volcanic eruptions does not begin to recover until 5--10 years later, suggesting the initiation of the Little Ice Age by decadally-paced eruptions in the early 1100s and late 1200s. Indeed, the latter period marks the decade of largest energy loss over the last millennium. Our reconstruction reveals that the energy imbalance for all 20-yr periods after 1980 is unprecedented in the pre-industrial period.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09896","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.625948","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsao-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Dominik Stiller, Gregory J.

This article introduces dynamic channel model for the THz band explicitly driven by the time-evolving droplet size distribution (DSD) of fog, integrating real-time microphysical sensing to capture variations in the fog microstructure. Experimental measurements were conducted at 220 GHz and 320 GHz in a controlled fog chamber to achieve quasi-stationary states, and a larger room-scale setup to characterize dynamic, non-stationary fog evolution. The results confirm that channel power loss is overwhelmingly dominated by absorption rather than scattering, validating the use of the computationally efficient Rayleigh approximation below 1 THz. Statistical analysis revealed exceptionally high Rician K-factors, demonstrating that THz channels maintain strong line-of-sight stability even in dense fog. System-level performance analysis shows that degradation in bit error rate is driven by the slow, gradual evolution of the DSD, rather than fast multipath fading. This finding enables the reliable simplification of the THz fog channel into a near-Gaussian channel model with time-varying signal-to-noise ratio. This microphysics-aware approach established here provides the necessary foundation for developing adaptive system designs centered on SNR tracking for robust future THz networks.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09906","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.626383","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsapp-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Jiaobiao Zhao, Kefeng Huang, Xiaoxiang Li, Mingxia Zhang, Peian Li, Jie Yang, Wenbo Liu, Yiming Zhao, Weidong Hu, Jianjun Ma","raw_content_length":1605,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DSD","Experimental Characterization and Dynamic Modeling"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1604,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Experimental Characterization","Dynamic Modeling","THz Channels","Fog Conditions","arXiv251009906v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The terahertz THz band","a promising candidate","sixth-generation wireless networks","its deploymen"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Experimental Characterization":2.0,"Dynamic Modeling":2.0,"THz Channels":2.0,"Fog Conditions":2.0,"arXiv251009906v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The terahertz THz band":1.0,"a promising candidate":1.0,"sixth-generation wireless networks":1.0,"its deploymen":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7740199361111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.582,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2836,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7286,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.033,"sadness":0.0236,"fear":0.1354,"anger":0.0361,"disgust":0.0338},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on characterizing THz channels under fog conditions, which is relevant to future 6G networks.

QCell complements existing datasets, bringing the total number of available data points to 41 million molecular systems, all calculated using hybrid density functional theory with nonlocal many-body dispersion interactions, as captured by the PBE0+MBD(-NL) level of quantum mechanics.

Spin current in antiferromagnets (AFMs) has been long thought to be trivial as nonmagnets. Recently, a class of spin-splitting AFMs has been shown to be able to generate unconventional spin current for spin-orbit torque (SOT) applications. However, such AFMs requires specific symmetry breaking, and have been largely restricted by the limited material candidates. Here, we reveal universal spin fluctuation-induced unconventional transverse spin current in conventional spin degenerate AFMs at finite temperature by taking collinear (AFM) L10-MnPt as an example. The field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization was achieved via out-of-plane anti-damping-like SOT, leveraging the spin current with both y- and z-spin polarizations in heterostructures with MnPt functioning as spin current source. Based on symmetry analyses and experimental characterizations of current-induced spin torques, we find that the spin current generated by L10-MnPt exhibits anisotropy that varies with the current direction, enforced by the low symmetry magnetic point group when its N\\'eel vector is along [110]. From a fundamental perspective, it would be intriguing to uncover a mechanism underlying the emergence of unconventional spin currents in spin degenerate antiferromagnets, which is highly desirable for spintronic applications.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09964","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.627807","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsapp-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Cuimei Cao, Meng Zhu, Shiwei Chen, Yizhuo Song, Xiaoyu Feng, Zhenzhong Yang, Yihan Wang, Shiheng Liang, Qingfeng Zhan, Jia Zhang, Long You","raw_content_length":1525,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SOT"],"persons":["MnPt"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1524,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Spin Fluctuations","arXiv251009964v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Modern magnetic memory technology","unconventional transverse spin current","deterministic switching","perpendicular magnetization","current","antiferromagnets","AFMs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Spin Fluctuations":2.0,"arXiv251009964v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Modern magnetic memory technology":1.0,"unconventional transverse spin current":1.0,"deterministic switching":1.0,"perpendicular magnetization":1.0,"current":1.0,"antiferromagnets":1.0,"AFMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774066753888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.8709999999999996,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8681,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.035,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0265,"anger":0.0327,"disgust":0.0243},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes research into using antiferromagnets for spin-orbit torque applications, potentially leading to more energy-efficient magnetic memory.

Utilizing a mixed-methods geospatial framework, the research integrates longitudinal enrollment data, district poverty metrics from the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), and neighborhood context from the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2019 to 2023. The analysis reveals that while statewide K-12 enrollment has contracted, the decline is not uniformly distributed. Districts with high concentrations of low-income students have experienced more pronounced losses, though the relationship between poverty and enrollment change is complex and weak at the statewide level (r=0.011 in 2023). Spatial analysis shows a checkerboard pattern of growth and decline, even among adjacent high-poverty districts, indicating that local factors such as housing instability, labor market conditions, and programmatic changes are significant drivers. The study identifies 18 high-risk districts characterized by both high poverty and recent enrollment declines, which warrant targeted stabilization efforts. The findings underscore that while concentrated poverty is a critical challenge, it does not deterministically predict enrollment loss. Consequently, the authors propose a dual-track policy approach: immediate, flexible support for high-risk districts to ensure stabilization, coupled with long-term structural investments in all high-need districts to address underlying resource gaps and enable sustained educational offerings.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09993","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.629542","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicssoc-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Uloma E.

Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms.

Space technology development presents a potential method to observe these normal modes by measuring inter-satellite distances. However, the disturbance from the Earth's low-degree gravity field makes it challenging for low Earth orbit gravity measurement satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TianQin-2 to extract signals from Earth's free oscillations directly. Here, we propose that by taking advantage of the high Earth orbit, the TianQin satellites can effectively avoid this disturbance, enabling direct measurement of Earth's free oscillations. We derive an analytical waveform to describe the response of Earth's free oscillations in TianQin. Based on this waveform, we use Bayesian analysis to extract the normal modes from numerical simulation data and perform parameter estimation. Our findings reveal that for a magnitude 7.9, Wenchuan-like earthquake, the resulting free oscillations will generate a signal that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 73 in TianQin, and approximately 9 different modes can be distinguished.

Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data.

So far, two main classes of localized wave vortices have been explored: (i) transversely-localized monochromatic vortex beams that carry well-defined longitudinal OAM and propagate/diffract in space, and (ii) 2D-localized spatiotemporal vortex pulses that carry the more elusive transverse (or tilted) OAM and propagate/diffract in both space and time. Here we introduce another class of wave vortices which are localized in a 2D plane, do not propagate in space (apart from uniform radial deformations), and instead propagate/diffract solely in time. These vortices possess well-defined transverse OAM and can naturally appear in 2D wave systems, such as surface polaritons or water waves. We provide a general integral expression for time-diffracting 2D wave vortices, their underlying ray model, as well as examples of approximate and exact wave solutions. We also analyze the temporal Gouy phase closely related to the rotational evolution in such vortices.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10147","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.638918","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Boris A.

To address this issue, we studied the phase sensitivity and the limit of detection of Tamm photonic crystals used as temperature sensors, taken here as a model system by exploring critical coupling and its associated phase singularity. To finely tune the optical Tamm mode to critical coupling, the top metal layer is periodically nanostructured and controlled, enabling the investigation of optical Tamm resonances around phase singularities. We use a highly stable common-path interferometry setup based on digital holography, which allows us to measure extremely high phase sensitivity even at very low light intensities, while also providing information about reflectivity in the complex domain. We experimentally validate an analytical model based on Temporal Coupled Mode Theory, which fully explains the phase sensitivity response and the limit of detection of such resonant photonic sensors. We demonstrate that, although approaching a phase singularity drastically enhances phase sensitivity, no improvement of the limit of detection is expected. Furthermore, phase singularity has no effect on the limit of detection, and therefore on the efficiency of such sensors for practical applications. This work provides a comprehensive description of phase sensors operating at critical coupling, and challenges the commonly accepted assumption regarding the role of phase singularities in sensing.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10153","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.639322","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"L.

At the molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10266","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.645753","language":"en","tags":["cond-matsoft","preprints","physicschem-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Pranay Jaiswal, Ivar S.

In this Letter, we propose using the Mean Information Gain (MIG) as a metric to quantify emergence in Agent-Based Models. The MIG is a conditional entropy-based metric that quantifies the lack of information about other elements in a structure given certain known properties. We apply it to a multi-agent biased random walk that reproduces Wolfram's four behavioral classes and show that MIG differentiates these behaviors. This metric reconnects the analysis of emergent behaviors with the classical notions of order, disorder, and entropy, thereby enabling the quantitative classification of regimes as convergent, periodic, complex, and chaotic. This approach overcomes the ambiguity of qualitative inspection near regime boundaries, particularly in large systems, and provides a compact, extensible framework for identifying and comparing emergent behaviors in complex systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10381","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.647004","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","nlinao","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Sebasti\\'an Rodr\\'iguez-Falc\\'on, Luciano Stucchi","raw_content_length":1152,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MIG"],"persons":["Wolfram"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1151,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantifying Emergent Behaviors","Agent","new Abstract","Emergent behaviors","a defining feature","complex systems","their quantitative characterization","an open challenge","traditional classifications","visual inspection"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantifying Emergent Behaviors":2.0,"Agent":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Emergent behaviors":1.0,"a defining feature":1.0,"complex systems":1.0,"their quantitative characterization":1.0,"an open challenge":1.0,"traditional classifications":1.0,"visual inspection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774380628611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8802,"joy":0.0131,"surprise":0.054,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0124,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.015},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel metric (Mean Information Gain) for quantifying emergent behaviors in agent-based models.

This paper presents a qualitative narrative review of an extensive collection of academic literature to synthesize evidence on the multifaceted effects of austerity. Following a thematic approach inspired by PRISMA guidelines, the economic, social, and political consequences of these measures are examined. The analysis reveals a majority consensus regarding the recessive effects of austerity, especially when implemented during economic crises, with negative fiscal multipliers that often exacerbate GDP contraction. Socially, austerity is associated with rising inequality, negative impacts on public health, disproportionate gender consequences, and a weakening of social safety nets. Politically, evidence links austerity to the erosion of trust in institutions, a rise in populism, and electoral instability. Despite the political narrative presenting austerity as an inevitable necessity for fiscal sustainability, academic literature underscores its high costs and questionable efficacy, advocating for more contextualized and equitable economic policy approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10449","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.647819","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicssoc-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Ricardo Alonzo Fern\\'andez Salguero","raw_content_length":1259,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Times of Crisis arXiv:2510.10449v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1258,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Crisis","Austerity","A Narrative Review","Its Economic","Social","Political Effects","Times","arXiv251010449v1","Announce Type","new Abstract"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Crisis":4.0,"Austerity":2.0,"A Narrative Review":2.0,"Its Economic":2.0,"Social":2.0,"Political Effects":2.0,"Times":2.0,"arXiv251010449v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7744102716666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.6104999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5897,"joy":0.0298,"surprise":0.1083,"sadness":0.0295,"fear":0.1958,"anger":0.0265,"disgust":0.0205},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a review of the impact of austerity policies, not a technology deployment.

However, efficient and tunable emission amplification post-fabrication poses major challenges. Hybrid metasurfaces combining niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), copper indium sulfide (CIS) quantum dots or hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) as a low-loss phase-change material offer a compelling solution for dynamic control and amplification of photoluminescence and quantum light emission. In this work, we report an active hybrid metasurface supporting tunable bound states in the continuum (BIC) resonances in the visible regime, achieving experimental Q-factors up to 206 and strong amplification of CIS QDs photoluminescence as well as quantum light emission of hBN single-photon emitters. The metasurface enables BIC resonance shifts of 33.5 nm in the visible spectrum via phase transition of Sb2S3, and 17 nm through dimensional parametric tuning. We experimentally demonstrate highly directional photoluminescence amplification up to 33-fold, alongside broad tunable amplified PL emission upon Sb2S3 phase modulation. Furthermore, we propose amplified, tunable, and on-demand strong coupling of hBN single-photon emitters with the tunable BIC metasurface for next-generation broadband quantum nanophotonic chips.

Self-comparison demonstrated a frequency instability of 2.2E-15/sqrt(tau/s) with an interrogation time of 180 ms, which reaches the high parts in E-18 level with an averaging time of only one day.

Among them, several resonant modes demonstrated high quality factors in the range of 10^3-10^4, along with near-unity modulation depth and strong spectral contrast. The optical responses were analyzed utilizing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, with Fano profiles fitted to theoretical models and the BIC governed modes validated via the squared inverse ratio law. Furthermore, multipolar decomposition and electromagnetic spatial field profile revealed the origins of the resonance, while LC circuit modeling provided additional physical insight into the Fano profiles. The proposed metasurface also exhibited strong polarization dependence, indicating its potential for active optical switching.

Although exact in principle, in practice, it relies on approximations to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional, which is known to be a unique functional of the electron density. Despite 50 years of active research, existing XC approximations remain far from general purpose chemical accuracy of various thermochemical and materials properties. In that light, the inverse DFT problem, of finding the exact XC potential corresponding to an accurate groundstate density, offers an insightful tool to understand the nature of the XC functional as well as aid in the development of more accurate functionals. However, solving the inverse DFT problem is fraught with several numerical challenges, such as non-uniqueness or spurious oscillations in the solution and non-convergence. We present invDFT as an open-source framework to address the outstanding challenges in inverse DFT and computed XC potentials solely from a target density. We do so by use of a systematically convergent finite-element basis and asymptotic corrections to the target density. We also employ several numerical and high-performance computing (HPC) advances that affords both efficiency and parallel scalability, on CPU-GPU hybrid architectures. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of invDFT using accurate full-configuration interaction (FCI) densities as well as model densities, ranging up to 100 electrons and spanning both weakly and strongly correlated molecules.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10529","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.655234","language":"en","tags":["physics","research","preprints","physicscomp-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Vishal Subramanian, Bikash Kanungo, Vikram Gavini","raw_content_length":1590,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DFT"],"persons":["invDFT"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1589,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["invDFT A CPU","arXiv251010529v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Density functional theory","DFT","principle","practice","approximations","the exchange-correlation XC functional","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"invDFT A CPU":2.0,"arXiv251010529v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Density functional theory":1.0,"DFT":1.0,"principle":1.0,"practice":1.0,"approximations":1.0,"the exchange-correlation XC functional":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7744879319444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9146,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0337,"sadness":0.0294,"fear":0.0054,"anger":0.0039,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents an open-source framework (invDFT) to solve the inverse DFT problem, which can aid in developing more accurate density functionals.

A commonly employed approach is to use inverse tapers interfacing with lensed fibers, particularly for waveguides of relatively low refractive index such as silicon nitride (Si3N4), silicon oxynitride and lithium niobate. This approach simultaneously enables broad operation bandwidth, high coupling efficiency, and simplified fabrication. While diverse taper designs have been invented and characterized so far, lensed fibers play equally important roles here, but their optimization has long underexplored. Here we fill this gap and introduce a comprehensive co-optimization strategy that synergistically refines the geometries of the taper and the lensed fiber. By incorporating the genuine lensed fiber's shape into simulation, we accurately capture the non-Gaussian emission profile of the lensed fiber, nullifying the widely accepted approximation using a paraxial Gaussian mode. We further characterize many lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers of varying shapes using different fabrication processes. Our experimental and simulation results show remarkable agreement, both achieving maximum coupling efficiencies exceeding 80% per facet. Finally, we summarize the optimal choices of lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers that can be directly deployed in modern CMOS foundries for scalable manufacturing of Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits. Our study not only contributes to light coupling solutions, but is also critical for photonic packaging and optoelectronic assembly that are currently revolutionizing datacenters and AI.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10635","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.656622","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Dengke Chen, Zeying Zhong, Sanli Huang, Jiahao Sun, Sicheng Zeng, Baoqi Shi, Yi-Han Luo, Junqiu Liu","raw_content_length":1849,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["neuromorphic computing"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1848,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["photonic integrated circuits","optimized lensed fibers","arXiv251010635v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Efficient and reliable light coupling","optical fibers","the most essential issue","integrated photonics","optical interconnects","nonlinear signal conversion"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"photonic integrated circuits":3.0,"optimized lensed fibers":2.0,"arXiv251010635v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Efficient and reliable light coupling":1.0,"optical fibers":1.0,"the most essential issue":1.0,"integrated photonics":1.0,"optical interconnects":1.0,"nonlinear signal conversion":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774528056388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8187,"joy":0.0436,"surprise":0.0855,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0118,"anger":0.0213,"disgust":0.0117},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a co-optimization strategy for light coupling in photonic integrated circuits, achieving coupling efficiencies exceeding 80% per facet.

The transmission of infectious diseases and the spreading of rumors have some common scenarios. Like cross-infection propagation of diseases, two or many kinds of rumors or information may spread at the same time. In this paper, we propose a novel I2E2S2R rumor-spreading model in a homogeneous network. The rumor-free equilibrium, as well as the basic reproduction number, have been calculated from the mean-field equations of the model. Lyapunov function and the LaSalle invariance principle are used to establish the global stability of the rumor-free equilibrium. In numerical simulations, it is perceived that a higher degree of network helps to spread rumors quickly. We have also found that making people aware can help to disappear rumors faster from the network. In addition, making people divert from the rumor to exact information can lessen the spreading of the rumor.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10672","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.658769","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","preprints","mathoc","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Md.

In this study, we propose a bioinspired aquatic machine that mimics the fruit of the water caltrop (Trapa natans L.). Among various plant species, T. natans produces unique woody fruits that can disperse passively via water currents or by clinging to boats or waterfowls. Inspired by the structures and dispersal mechanisms of T. natans, we designed miniaturized biomimetic machines capable of passive dispersion in aquatic ecosystems. In order to study our selected biological model, we collected natural fresh and dried mature samples of T. natans fruits. We designed biomimetic aquatic machines by extracting the main geometrical details from the natural samples, and by exploiting advanced three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, including x-ray micro-computed topography (Micro-CT). Then, we successfully fabricate the biomimetic machines at high-resolution in two configurations (hollow body and solid body) using light-based bioprinting of photo-responsive hydrogels. We also characterized the mechanical properties of the bioprinted materials through compression tests. Finally, we evaluated the floating behavior of the biomimetic machines in a flow chamber as a proof of concept. This biomimetic approach enhances the adaptability of the machine in aquatic environments, offering new design insights for underwater, soft, and microrobotics.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10686","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.659179","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsapp-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Yuanquan Liu, Thomas Speck, Isabella Fiorello","raw_content_length":1552,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1551,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251010686v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Plants","a source","inspiration","robotics","engineers","this study","a bioinspired aquatic machine","the fruit"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["this study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251010686v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Plants":1.0,"a source":1.0,"inspiration":1.0,"robotics":1.0,"engineers":1.0,"this study":1.0,"a bioinspired aquatic machine":1.0,"the fruit":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7746159016666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7651,"joy":0.1116,"surprise":0.0524,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0207,"disgust":0.0369},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes the design and fabrication of bioinspired aquatic machines.

In a two-phase flow, the soluble surfactants can adsorb/desorb from/into the bulk of any of the phases to the interface and can modify the interface properties. This results in sharp gradients in the surfactant concentration on the interface and also between the two phases in the bulk when there is selective adsorption/desorption, presenting a serious challenge for the numerical simulations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational model for the transport of soluble surfactants that can model the adsorption and desorption processes accurately. The model is discretized using a central-difference scheme, which leads to a non-dissipative implementation that is crucial for the simulation of turbulent flows. The model is used with the ACDI diffuse-interface method (Jain, 2022), but can also be used with other algebraic-based interface-capturing methods. Furthermore, the provable strengths of the proposed model are: (a) the model maintains the positivity property of the surfactant concentration field, a physical realizability requirement for the simulation of surfactants, when the proposed criterion is satisfied, (b) the proposed model maintains discrete confinement of the interfacial and bulk surfactants and prevents artificial numerical diffusion of the surfactant between the interface and the bulk and between the two phases in the bulk. Finally, we present numerical simulations using the proposed model for both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional cases and assess: the accuracy and robustness of the model, the validity of the positivity property of the scalar concentration field, and the confinement of the surfactant at the interface. We also study the effect of surfactants on an oscillating droplet and on a complex droplet/bubble-laden turbulent flow.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10857","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.668734","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicscomp-ph","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":281,"author":"Suhas S.

Fully exploiting this potential requires extensive calibration to ensure both linearity and uniformity of the pixel response, which is challenging for detectors with a large dynamic range. To overcome the limitations of conventional calibration methods, we developed an accurate and efficient correction method to achieve pixel-wise gain and nonlinearity calibration based on the backside pulsing technique. A three-dimensional lookup table was generated for all pixels across the full dynamic range, mapping the pixel response to a calibrated linear energy scale. Compared with conventional linear calibration, the proposed method yields negligible deviations between the calibrated and nominal energies for photons and electrons. The improvement in energy resolution ranges from 4% to 22% for 15-25 keV photons and from 16% to 23% for 60-200 keV electrons. Deep learning-based electron localization demonstrates a 4% improvement in spatial resolution when using the proposed calibration method.

The method is systematically validated over a wide range of size parameters, thereby covering the Rayleigh, Mie, and geometric optics regimes, through comparison with established reference solutions. For circular cylinders, both perfect electrically conducting (PEC) and dielectric, LBM results are benchmarked against analytical Mie theory. For dielectric cylinders, comparisons are performed over a broad range of relative permittivities to assess accuracy across different material contrasts. Scattering from dielectric spheres is likewise compared with exact Mie solutions, showing excellent agreement. To assess performance for non-canonical geometries, we investigate a hexagonal dielectric cylinder and validate the results against the Discretized Mie-Formalism, demonstrating that LBM can accurately capture edge diffraction and sharp-facet effects. Overall, the study provides the first systematic benchmarking of LBM for electromagnetic scattering in one-, two-, and three-dimensional configurations, establishing it as a promising and versatile tool in computational electromagnetics.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11042","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.670438","language":"en","tags":["physicscomp-ph","physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Mohd.

However, the precise effects of chest compression are not quantifiable to this day. This often results in a low quality of chest compressions even if performed by health-care professionals. One solution could be provided by quantification of blood flow via ultrasonic Doppler measurements, to guide first responders in their efforts. This paper presents an approach to address the issue of limited time, anatomical know how and limitations of system configuration during emergency scenarios. An approach for automated vessel identification with three different phases was developed, featuring a new sensor probe for ultrasonic measurements with non symmetrically angled piezo ceramics. The probe was used with prototype ultrasound hardware in a laboratory setup for Pulsed Wave Doppler (PW Doppler). In an initial measurement a qualitative flow was approximated to examine valuable measurement positions on a phantom. Afterwards an iterative mode was used for depth depending frequency measurements with score calculation of flow periodicity and signal power. The configuration with the best score was used for a prolonged monitoring mode. Flow values were compared to data of an industrial flow-sensor. Flow-sensor data showed an average coefficient of determination of 0.97 with an average root mean square error of 3.84 ml/s. With the proposed hardware and software solutions a basis for future developments was made, which could lead to a fully automated vessel identification during CPR. This device could provide first responders as well as clinical staff with vital information about CPR efficiency that has yet to be included into the therapy of people during cardiac arrest.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11060","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.670887","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","physicsmed-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Reinhard Fuchs, Nathalie Sumrah, Johannes Schwerdt, Michael Unger, Georg Stachel, Michael Schultz, Karsten Lenk, Thomas Neumuth","raw_content_length":1845,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Doppler","Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1844,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Basis","a hands free blood flow measurement","automated vessel focus","Announce Type","new Abstract","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","CPR","the essential tools","oxygen supply","cardiac arrest"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Basis":2.0,"a hands free blood flow measurement":2.0,"automated vessel focus":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation":1.0,"CPR":1.0,"the essential tools":1.0,"oxygen supply":1.0,"cardiac arrest":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774748866388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8614,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0178,"sadness":0.012,"fear":0.0652,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0203},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a prototype device for automated blood flow measurement during CPR.

The infiltration velocity within the porous medium is evaluated using the Darcy model, and buoyancy effects are accounted for using the Boussinesq approximation. The Akbari-Ganji method (AGM) is applied to address the governing energy equations. The accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by comparing it with numerical results obtained from the finite difference method (FDM), the finite element method (FEM), and earlier investigations. The results are presented regarding the total average Nusselt number and temperature profiles. These results shed light on the influence of several important parameters, such as the thermal conductivity ratio, dimensionless thickness, convectional heat transfer, and external and internal radiation. The analysis reveals that decreasing Rayleigh and Biot numbers reduces the temperature profiles of the solid phase. Additionally, when the Rayleigh number is low but the assigned Biot number is high, the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases diminishes. Furthermore, increased thermal conductivity ratio and dimensionless thickness for assigned Biot and Rayleigh numbers lead to higher solid phase temperatures. The Nusselt number exhibits a decreasing trend with a decreasing thermal conductivity ratio but increases with higher Rayleigh and Biot numbers and increased external radiation.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11157","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.672129","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicscomp-ph","physicsapp-ph","preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Payam Jalili, Salar Ghadiri Alamdari, Bahram Jalili, Amirali Shateri, Davood Domiri Ganji","raw_content_length":1587,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FDM","Boussinesq","LTNE","AGM"],"persons":["Darcy"],"locations":["Nusselt"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1586,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Analytical and numerical investigation","heat transfer","porous fin","a local thermal non","arXiv251011157v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This research","a local thermal non-equilibrium LTNE model","the heat transfer phenomenon","a porous fin"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Analytical and numerical investigation":2.0,"heat transfer":2.0,"porous fin":2.0,"a local thermal non":2.0,"arXiv251011157v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This research":1.0,"a local thermal non-equilibrium LTNE model":1.0,"the heat transfer phenomenon":1.0,"a porous fin":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774793486388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8309,"joy":0.0318,"surprise":0.0638,"sadness":0.009,"fear":0.0163,"anger":0.0259,"disgust":0.0223},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates heat transfer in porous fins using numerical methods.

Unlike electron spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is strongly influenced by crystal field effects and band topology, making its orientation difficult to manipulate with external fields. In this work, by using first principle calculations, we investigate quantum anomalous Hall insulators (QAHIs) as a model system to study the layer orbital Hall effect (OHE). Due to band inversion, only one valley remains orbital polarization, and thus the OHE originates from a single valley. Based on stacking symmetry analysis, we investigated both AA and AB stacking configurations, which possess mirror and inversion symmetries, respectively. The excitation of OAM exhibits valley selectivity, determined jointly by valley polarization and orbital polarization. In AA stacking, the absence of inversion center gives rise to intrinsic orbital polarization, leading to OAM excitations from different valleys in the two layers.

Despite a few successes of reduced order models, mean field and simplified homogenization approaches often remain the preferred choice. In this work, a recently proposed hyper-reduction method (called E3C) for projection-based Reduced Order Models (pROMs) is applied to the problem of computational homogenization of geometrically linearly deforming elastoplastic polycrystals. The main novelty lies in the identification of reduced modes (the 'E3C-modes'), which replace the strain modes of the reduced-order model, leading to a significantly smaller number of integration points. The peculiarity, which distinguishes the method from more conventional hyper-reduction techniques, is that the E3C integration points are not taken from the set of FE integration points. Instead, they can be interpreted as generalized integration points in strain space which are trained such as to satisfy an orthogonality condition, which ensures that the hyper-reduced model matches the equilibrium states and macroscopic stresses of full-field model data as accurately as possible. In addition, the number of grains is reduced, preserving the main features of the original texture of the finite element model. Two macroscopic engineering parts (untextured and textured) are simulated, illustrating the performance of the method in three-dimensional two-scale applications involving hundreds of thousands macroscopic degrees of freedom and millions of grains with computing times in the order of hours (cumulated online and offline effort) on standard laptop hardware.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11187","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.674879","language":"en","tags":["physics","research","preprints","physicscomp-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Stephan Wulfinghoff","raw_content_length":1824,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.275,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Empirically Corrected Cluster Cubature","Reduced Order Models","Computational Crystal Plasticity Homogenization"],"persons":["Hyper arXiv:2510.11187v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1823,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["E3C","Computational Crystal Plasticity Homogenization","arXiv251011187v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The computational homogenization","elastoplastic polycrystals","a challenging task","the huge number","grains","their complicated interactions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["grains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"E3C":3.0,"Computational Crystal Plasticity Homogenization":2.0,"arXiv251011187v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The computational homogenization":1.0,"elastoplastic polycrystals":1.0,"a challenging task":1.0,"the huge number":1.0,"grains":1.0,"their complicated interactions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774880436388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.355499999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0711,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8347,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.0229,"sadness":0.0111,"fear":0.052,"anger":0.0421,"disgust":0.0278},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel computational method (E3C) for simulating the behavior of materials, which could potentially lead to more efficient material design and manufacturing.

It is found that there are two kinds of final flow types, one is vortical flow, the other is zonal flow, and their statistics are completely different. Especially, the two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step decreases to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each type of turbulent flows should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise has huge influences on final flow type and statistics of numerical simulation of the NS turbulence (i.e. turbulence governed by NS equations), since time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations as turbulence model have such an assumption that all small stochastic disturbances for $t>0$ are negligible. This leads to a logic paradox in theory. Obviously, more investigations are necessary to reveal the essential differences between the NS turbulence, its numerical simulation, and real turbulence.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11220","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.675270","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsflu-dyn","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Shijie Qin, Kun Xu, Shijun Liao","raw_content_length":1179,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DNS","the Navier-Stokes","Rayleigh arXiv:2510.11220v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1178,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensitivity dependence","the Navier-Stokes turbulence","a two-dimensional Rayleigh","Announce Type","new Abstract","A two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection","traditional direct numerical simulation","DNS","double precision","various time-steps"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensitivity dependence":2.0,"the Navier-Stokes turbulence":2.0,"a two-dimensional Rayleigh":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection":1.0,"traditional direct numerical simulation":1.0,"DNS":1.0,"double precision":1.0,"various time-steps":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774896128888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8652,"joy":0.0147,"surprise":0.0951,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0098,"disgust":0.0043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article discusses the sensitivity of Navier-Stokes turbulence to numerical noise in simulations, highlighting a potential paradox in the model's assumptions.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_74f14686ed60","title":"An AI dose engine for fast carbon ion treatment planning","content":"arXiv:2510.11271v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide gold-standard accuracy for carbon ion therapy dose calculations but are computationally intensive. Analytical pencil beam algorithms offer speed but reduced accuracy in heterogeneous tissues. We developed the first AI-based dose engine capable of predicting absorbed dose, the alpha and beta parameters for relative biological effectiveness (RBE)- weighted optimisation in carbon ion therapy, delivering MC-level accuracy with drastically reduced computation time. We extended the transformer-based DoTA model to predict absorbed dose (C-DoTA-d), alpha (C-DoTA-alpha), and beta (C-DoTA-beta), introducing a cross-attention mechanism for alpha and beta to combine dose and energy inputs. The training dataset consisted of ~70,000 pencil beams from 187 head-and-neck patients, with ground-truth values obtained using the GPU-accelerated MC toolkit FRED. Performance was evaluated on an independent test set using gamma pass rate (1%/1 mm), depth-dose, and isodose contour Dice coefficients. MC dropout-based uncertainty analysis was performed. Median gamma pass rates exceeded 98% for all predictions (99.76% for dose, 99.14% for alpha, and 98.74% for beta), with minima above 85% in the most heterogeneous anatomies. The Dice coefficient was 0.95 for 1% isodose contours, with slightly reduced agreement in high-gradient regions. Compared to MC FRED, inference was over 400x faster (0.032 s vs. 14 s per pencil beam) while maintaining accuracy. Uncertainty analysis showed high stability, with mean standard deviations below 0.5% for all models. C-DoTA achieves MC-quality predictions of absorbed dose and RBE model parameters in ~30 milliseconds per beam. Its speed and accuracy support online adaptive planning, paving the way for more effective carbon ion therapy workflows. Future work will expand to additional anatomical sites, beam geometries, and clinical beamlines.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11271","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.676102","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsmed-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":273,"author":"Anastasiia Quarz, Angelica De Gregorio, Gaia Franciosini, Angelo Schiavi, Zolt\\'an Perk\\'o, Lennart Volz, Vincenzo Patera, Marco Durante, Christian Graeff","raw_content_length":1959,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.365,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DoTA","GPU"],"persons":["Announce Type","Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1958,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["An AI dose engine","fast carbon ion treatment planning","arXiv251011271v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Monte Carlo","simulations","gold-standard accuracy","carbon ion therapy dose calculations","Analytical pencil beam algorithms","speed"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["An AI dose engine","Analytical pencil beam algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"An AI dose engine":2.0,"fast carbon ion treatment planning":2.0,"arXiv251011271v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Monte Carlo":1.0,"simulations":1.0,"gold-standard accuracy":1.0,"carbon ion therapy dose calculations":1.0,"Analytical pencil beam algorithms":1.0,"speed":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7749261941666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8498,"joy":0.0255,"surprise":0.0749,"sadness":0.0131,"fear":0.0078,"anger":0.0179,"disgust":0.011},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes an AI model that significantly reduces the computation time for carbon ion therapy dose calculations, potentially leading to more effective cancer treatment.
