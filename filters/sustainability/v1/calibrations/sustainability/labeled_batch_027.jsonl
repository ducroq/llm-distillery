{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fd82a69ed760","title":"FLASH-TB: Integrating Arc","content":"arXiv:2312.13146v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present FLASH-TB, a journey planning algorithm for public transit networks that combines Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (TB) with the Arc-Flags speedup technique. The basic idea is simple: The network is partitioned into a configurable number of cells. For each cell and each possible transfer between two vehicles, the algorithm precomputes a flag that indicates whether the transfer is required to reach the cell. During a query, only flagged transfers are explored. Our algorithm improves upon previous attempts to apply Arc-Flags to public transit networks, which saw limited success due to conflicting rules for pruning the search space. We show that these rules can be reconciled while still producing correct results. Because the number of cells is configurable, FLASH-TB offers a tradeoff between query time and memory consumption. It is significantly more space-efficient than existing techniques with a comparable preprocessing time, which store generalized shortest-path trees: to match their query performance, it requires up to two orders of magnitude less memory. The fastest configuration of FLASH-TB achieves a speedup of more than two orders of magnitude over TB, offering sub-millisecond query times even on large countrywide networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13146","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.383868","language":"en","tags":["research","csds","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Ernestine Gro{\\ss}mann, Jonas Sauer, Christian Schulz, Patrick Steil, Sascha Witt","raw_content_length":1312,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Trip-Based Public Transit Routing","Arc-Flags"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1311,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FLASH-TB","Integrating Arc","Announce Type","Abstract","a journey","algorithm","public transit networks","Trip-Based Public Transit Routing","the Arc-Flags speedup technique","The basic idea"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FLASH-TB":3.0,"Integrating Arc":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a journey":1.0,"algorithm":1.0,"public transit networks":1.0,"Trip-Based Public Transit Routing":1.0,"the Arc-Flags speedup technique":1.0,"The basic idea":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7784869866666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9158,"joy":0.0135,"surprise":0.0533,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0041,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0026},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The algorithm improves public transit routing, potentially reducing individual vehicle use and associated emissions.

Most respondents expressed substantial uncertainty about the long-term value of AI progress: While 68.3% thought good outcomes from superhuman AI are more likely than bad, of these net optimists 48% gave at least a 5% chance of extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction, and 59% of net pessimists gave 5% or more to extremely good outcomes. Between 38% and 51% of respondents gave at least a 10% chance to advanced AI leading to outcomes as bad as human extinction. More than half suggested that \"substantial\" or \"extreme\" concern is warranted about six different AI-related scenarios, including misinformation, authoritarian control, and inequality.

Termed the box filtration of a PCD, we grow boxes (hyperrectangles) that are not necessarily centered at each point (in place of balls centered at points). We grow the boxes non-uniformly and asymmetrically in different dimensions based on the distribution of points. We present two approaches to handle the boxes: a point cover where each point is assigned its own box at start, and a pixel cover that works with a pixelization of the space of the PCD. Any box cover in either setting automatically gives a mapper of the PCD. We show that the persistence diagrams generated by the box filtration using both point and pixel covers satisfy the classical stability based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Using boxes also implies that the box filtration is identical for pairwise or higher order intersections whereas the VR and Cech filtration are not the same. Growth in each dimension is computed by solving a linear program (LP) that optimizes a cost functional balancing the cost of expansion and benefit of including more points in the box. The box filtration algorithm runs in $O(m|U(0)|\\log(mn\\pi)L(q))$ time, where $m$ is number of steps of increments considered for box growth, $|U(0)|$ is the number of boxes in the initial cover ($\\leq$ number of points), $\\pi$ is the step length for increasing each box dimension, each LP is solved in $O(L(q))$ time, $n$ is the PCD dimension, and $q = n \\times |X|$. We demonstrate through multiple examples that the box filtration can produce more accurate results to summarize the topology of the PCD than VR and distance-to-measure (DTM) filtrations.

In scenarios where optimum handwriting samples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a sentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated noteworthy levels of accuracy. However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement. In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07602","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.387753","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","cscv","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Vineet Kumar, Suresh Sundaram","raw_content_length":1562,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN","Offline Writer Identification","Convolutional Neural Network"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1559,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Attention based End","network","Offline Writer Identification","Word level data","scenarios","the form","Announce Type","Abstract","Writer identification","its widespread application"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["network"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Attention based End":2.0,"network":2.0,"Offline Writer Identification":2.0,"Word level data":2.0,"scenarios":2.0,"the form":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Writer identification":1.0,"its widespread application":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778604803888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9122,"joy":0.0188,"surprise":0.0528,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0029,"anger":0.0048,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new algorithm for writer identification.

However, current detectors often suffer from a dual-overfitting: they become overly specialized in both specific forgery fingerprints and particular demographic attributes. Critically, most existing methods overlook the latter issue, which results in poor fairness: faces from certain demographic groups, such as different genders or ethnicities, are consequently more difficult to reliably detect. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy called misleading-learning, which populates the latent space with a multitude of redundant environments. By exposing the detector to a sufficiently rich and balanced variety of high-level information for demographic fairness, our approach mitigates demographic bias while maintaining a high detection performance level. We conduct extensive evaluations on fairness, intra-domain detection, cross-domain generalization, and robustness.

To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications, such as $H_{\\infty}$ and LQR with multiplicative noise, across a collection of engineering control systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16250","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.388641","language":"en","tags":["statme","cssy","computer-science","eesssy","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Yash Patel, Sahana Rayan, Ambuj Tewari","raw_content_length":1459,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LQR","Linear Systems"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1458,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["designs","Conformal Robust Control","Linear Systems","end","arXiv240516250v4 Announce Type","Abstract","which","concurrently defined optimal controllers","practice","the misspecification"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"designs":3.0,"Conformal Robust Control":2.0,"Linear Systems":2.0,"end":2.0,"arXiv240516250v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"which":1.0,"concurrently defined optimal controllers":1.0,"practice":1.0,"the misspecification":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7786332441666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9001,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9191,"joy":0.0206,"surprise":0.0304,"sadness":0.0021,"fear":0.0062,"anger":0.012,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel control methodology for linear systems using conformal prediction to specify uncertainty regions.

Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17068","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.389050","language":"en","tags":["csna","statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Saravanan Kandasamy, Dheeraj Nagaraj","raw_content_length":1325,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Langevin Dynamics","Langevin","LMC","The Poisson Midpoint Method","a Stochastic Differential Equation","Langevin Dynamics: Provably Efficient Discretization for"],"persons":["Langevin Monte Carlo","Euler","Midpoint Method"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1324,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Langevin Dynamics","The Poisson Midpoint Method","Provably Efficient Discretization","Diffusion Models","LMC","arXiv240517068v3","Announce Type","Abstract","a Stochastic Differential Equation","SDE"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Langevin Dynamics":3.0,"The Poisson Midpoint Method":2.0,"Provably Efficient Discretization":2.0,"Diffusion Models":2.0,"LMC":2.0,"arXiv240517068v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a Stochastic Differential Equation":1.0,"SDE":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778648358611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6728,"joy":0.0191,"surprise":0.042,"sadness":0.1407,"fear":0.0703,"anger":0.0164,"disgust":0.0388},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new algorithm (Poisson Midpoint Method) for improving the efficiency of diffusion models used in image generation.

Current approaches predominantly employ machine learning (ML) models, which often require extensive labeled data for training. To mitigate data insufficiency, we propose FlexLog, a novel hybrid approach for ULAD that combines ML models -- decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and a feedforward neural network -- with a Large Language Model (Mistral) through ensemble learning. FlexLog also incorporates a cache and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness. To evaluate FlexLog, we configured four datasets for \\task, namely ADFA-U, LOGEVOL-U, SynHDFS-U, and SYNEVOL-U. FlexLog outperforms all baselines by at least 1.2 percentage points (pp) in F1 score while using much less labeled data (62.87 pp reduction). When trained on the same amount of data as the baselines, FlexLog achieves up to a 13 pp increase in F1 score on ADFA-U across varying training dataset sizes. Additionally, FlexLog maintains inference time under one second per log sequence, making it suitable for most applications, except latency-sensitive systems. Further analysis reveals the positive impact of FlexLog's key components: cache, RAG and ensemble learning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07467","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.390673","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Fatemeh Hadadi, Qinghua Xu, Domenico Bianculli, Lionel Briand","raw_content_length":1468,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FlexLog","\\task","ADFA-U"],"persons":["a Large Language Model (Mistral"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1467,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLM","logs","ULAD","arXiv240607467v4 Announce Type","Abstract","Most log-based anomaly detectors","software","environmental changes","Anomaly detection","unstable logs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"],"engineering":["software"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLM":2.0,"logs":2.0,"ULAD":2.0,"arXiv240607467v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Most log-based anomaly detectors":1.0,"software":1.0,"environmental changes":1.0,"Anomaly detection":1.0,"unstable logs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.77870556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.742,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8809,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.0114,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0594,"anger":0.0219,"disgust":0.0147},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach (FlexLog) for anomaly detection in unstable logs, combining ML models with a Large Language Model.

Although many efforts have been made, most existing methods use a predefined graph approach to capture the sample similarity or the label correlation. In this manner, the presence of noise and outliers within the original feature space can undermine the reliability of the resulting sample similarity graph. It also fails to precisely depict the label correlation due to the existence of unknown labels. Besides, these methods only consider the discriminative power of selected features, while neglecting their redundancy. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Collaborative Correlation lEarning-based Semi-Supervised Multi-label Feature Selection (Access-MFS) method to address these issues. Specifically, a generalized regression model equipped with an extended uncorrelated constraint is introduced to select discriminative yet irrelevant features and maintain consistency between predicted and ground-truth labels in labeled data, simultaneously. Then, the instance correlation and label correlation are integrated into the proposed regression model to adaptively learn both the sample similarity graph and the label similarity graph, which mutually enhance feature selection performance.

While this emerging paradigm has been primarily focusing on task similarity, there remains a hugely untapped potential in harnessing the shared characteristics between different domains. For example, real-world complex systems usually share the same characteristics, such as the power-law rule, small-world property and community structure, thus making it possible to transfer solutions optimized in one system to another to facilitate the optimization. Drawing inspiration from this observation of shared characteristics within complex systems, we present a novel framework, multi-domain evolutionary optimization (MDEO). First, we propose a community-level measurement of graph similarity to manage the knowledge transfer among domains. Furthermore, we develop a graph learning-based network alignment model that serves as the conduit for effectively transferring solutions between different domains. Moreover, we devise a self-adaptive mechanism to determine the number of transferred solutions from different domains, and introduce a knowledge-guided mutation mechanism that adaptively redefines mutation candidates to facilitate the utilization of knowledge from other domains. To evaluate its performance, we use a challenging combinatorial problem known as adversarial link perturbation as the primary illustrative optimization task. Experiments on multiple real-world networks of different domains demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in efficacy compared to classical evolutionary optimization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14865","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.391513","language":"en","tags":["research","csne","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Jie Zhao, Kang Hao Cheong, Yaochu Jin","raw_content_length":1798,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Complex Networks","MTEO","Multidomain Evolutionary Optimization on Combinatorial Problems"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1797,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Multidomain Evolutionary Optimization","Combinatorial Problems","Complex Networks","Announce Type","Abstract","Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization","significant attention","multi-task evolutionary optimization","MTEO","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multidomain Evolutionary Optimization"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Multidomain Evolutionary Optimization":2.0,"Combinatorial Problems":2.0,"Complex Networks":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Knowledge transfer-based evolutionary optimization":1.0,"significant attention":1.0,"multi-task evolutionary optimization":1.0,"MTEO":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778733488888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2775,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8555,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8378,"joy":0.0396,"surprise":0.0885,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework for multi-domain evolutionary optimization (MDEO) to solve complex problems in networks.

Padded decompositions have been studied for decades and have found numerous applications, including metric embedding, multicommodity flow-cut gap, multicut, and zero extension problems, to name a few. In these applications, parameter $\\beta$, called the padding parameter, is the most important parameter since it decides either the distortion or the approximation ratios. For general graphs with $n$ vertices, $\\beta = \\Theta(\\log n)$. Klein, Plotkin, and Rao showed that $K_r$-minor-free graphs have padding parameter $\\beta = O(r^3)$, which is a significant improvement over general graphs when $r$ is a constant. A long-standing conjecture is to construct a padded decomposition for $K_r$-minor-free graphs with padding parameter $\\beta = O(\\log r)$. Despite decades of research, the best-known result is $\\beta = O(r)$, even for graphs with treewidth at most $r$. In this work, we make significant progress toward the aforementioned conjecture by showing that graphs with treewidth $\\rm{tw}$ admit a padded decomposition with padding parameter $O(\\log \\rm{tw})$, which is tight. As corollaries, we obtain an exponential improvement in dependency on treewidth in a host of algorithmic applications: $O(\\sqrt{ \\log n \\cdot \\log(\\rm{tw})})$ flow-cut gap, max flow-min multicut ratio of $O(\\log(\\rm{tw}))$, an $O(\\log(\\rm{tw}))$ approximation for the 0-extension problem, an $\\ell^{O(\\log n)}_\\infty$ embedding with distortion $O(\\log \\rm{tw})$, and an $O(\\log \\rm{tw})$ bound for integrality gap for the uniform sparsest cut.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12230","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.392828","language":"en","tags":["csds","computer-science","preprints","csdm","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Arnold Filtser, Tobias Friedrich, Davis Issac, Nikhil Kumar, Hung Le, Nadym Mallek, Ziena Zeif","raw_content_length":1946,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Optimal Padded Decomposition For Bounded Treewidth Graphs arXiv:2407.12230v3"],"persons":["Announce Type","K_r$-minor","\\be","Rao","\\beta"],"locations":["Klein","Plotkin"],"monetary":["at least $","\\beta$"]},"char_count":1945,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimal Padded Decomposition","Bounded Treewidth Graphs","Announce Type","Abstract","A betadeltaDelta-padded decomposition","an edge-weighted graph","a stochastic decomposition","clusters","diameter","every vertex"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimal Padded Decomposition":2.0,"Bounded Treewidth Graphs":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"A betadeltaDelta-padded decomposition":1.0,"an edge-weighted graph":1.0,"a stochastic decomposition":1.0,"clusters":1.0,"diameter":1.0,"every vertex":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7787778758333332,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8859,"joy":0.0122,"surprise":0.0707,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0075,"anger":0.0096,"disgust":0.007},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical improvement in graph decomposition algorithms, potentially leading to more efficient solutions for problems relevant to sustainability, such as flow-cut gaps and sparsest cut problems.

Our focus is particularly on the *strictly sublinear* regime of MPC where the space per machine is $O(n^\\delta)$. Here $n$ is the number of vertices and constant $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$ can be made arbitrarily small. The MST problem admits a simple and folklore $O(\\log n)$-round algorithm in the MPC model. When the weights can be arbitrary, this matches a conditional lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ which follows from a well-known 1vs2-Cycle conjecture. As such, much of the literature focuses on breaking the logarithmic barrier in more structured variants of the problem, such as when the vertices correspond to points in low- [ANOY14, STOC'14] or high-dimensional Euclidean spaces [JMNZ, SODA'24]. In this work, we focus more generally on metric spaces. Namely, all pairwise weights are provided and guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality, but are otherwise unconstrained. We show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate MST can be found in $O(\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} + \\log \\log n)$ rounds, which is the first $o(\\log n)$-round algorithm for finding any constant approximation in this setting. Other than being applicable to more general weight functions, our algorithm also slightly improves the $O(\\log \\log n \\cdot \\log \\log \\log n)$ round-complexity of [JMNZ24, SODA'24] and significantly improves its approximation from a large constant to $1+\\varepsilon$. On the lower bound side, we prove that under the 1vs2-Cycle conjecture, $\\Omega(\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ rounds are needed for finding a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate MST in general metrics. It is worth noting that while many existing lower bounds in the MPC model under the 1vs2-Cycle conjecture only hold against \"component stable\" algorithms, our lower bound applies to *all* algorithms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06455","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.394570","language":"en","tags":["research","csds","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":288,"author":"Amir Azarmehr, Soheil Behnezhad, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub {\\L}\\k{a}cki, Vahab Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong","raw_content_length":1950,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.44,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MPC","\\in","General Metric Spaces arXiv:2408.06455v2 Announce Type","n)$","MST"],"persons":["JMNZ"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$O(\\log n)$-round"]},"char_count":1945,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Massively Parallel Minimum Spanning Tree","General Metric Spaces","Announce Type","Abstract","the minimum spanning tree","MST problem","the massively parallel computation","MPC model","Our focus","the strictly sublinear regime"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Massively Parallel Minimum Spanning Tree":2.0,"General Metric Spaces":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the minimum spanning tree":1.0,"MST problem":1.0,"the massively parallel computation":1.0,"MPC model":1.0,"Our focus":1.0,"the strictly sublinear regime":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7788371811111108,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8644,"joy":0.0337,"surprise":0.0475,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.018,"anger":0.0226,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm for finding approximate minimum spanning trees in general metric spaces within the massively parallel computation (MPC) model.

In this study, we examined whether actimetry and machine learning (ML) could provide objective criteria for food addiction (FA) and symptom counts (SC). In 78 participants (mean age 22.1 +/- 9.5 y; 73.1% women), one week of non-dominant wrist actimetry and psychometric data (YFAS, DEBQ, ZSDS) were collected. The time series were segmented into daytime activity and nighttime rest, and statistical and entropy descriptors (FuzzyEn, DistEn, SVDEn, PermEn, PhaseEn; 256 features) were calculated. The mean Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was used as the primary metric in a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) pipeline with five-fold stratified cross-validation (one hundred repetitions; 500 evaluations); SHAP was used to assist in interpretation. For binary FA, activity-segment features performed best (MCC = 0.78 +/- 0.02; Accuracy ~ 95.3% +/- 0.5; Sensitivity ~ 0.77 +/- 0.03; Specificity ~ 0.98 +/- 0.004), exceeding OaS (Objective and Subjective Features) (MCC = 0.69 +/- 0.03) and rest-only (MCC = 0.50 +/- 0.03). For SC (four classes), OaS slightly surpassed actimetry (MCC = 0.40 +/- 0.01 vs 0.38 +/- 0.01; Accuracy ~ 58.1% vs 56.9%). Emotional and restrained eating were correlated with actimetric features.

The modification is based on the new model proposed by Dreyer, Guhlke and Muller [39], where the diffusion flux in the classical PNP system is replaced with an implicitly involved new diffusion flux, leading to fractional nonlinearity. He and Sun [42] previously developed a numerical approach for another type of modification, where the Poisson equation in the PNP system was substituted with a fourth-order elliptic equation. Another key contribution of this work is the reduction of the equilibrium system to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann system. The proposed numerical scheme is capable of handling both compressible and incompressible regimes by employing a bulk modulus parameter, which governs the fluid's compressibility and enables seamless transition between these regimes. To emphasize practical relevance, we discuss the implications of compressible electrolytes in the context of double-layer capacitance behavior. We also conduct numerical simulations over various domains to demonstrate its applicability under various operating conditions, including temperature fluctuations and variations in the bulk modulus.

While previous methods achieve excellent results on manifold meshes by using the quadric error metric, they struggle to produce high-quality outputs for meshes in the wild, which typically contain non-manifold elements and multiple connected components. In this work, we propose a method for simplifying these wild textured triangle meshes. We formulate mesh simplification as a problem of decimating simplicial 2-complexes to handle multiple non-manifold mesh components collectively. Building on the success of quadric error simplification, we iteratively collapse 1-simplices (vertex pairs). Our approach employs a modified quadric error that converges to the original quadric error metric for watertight manifold meshes, while significantly improving the results on wild meshes. For textures, instead of following existing strategies to preserve UVs, we adopt a novel perspective which focuses on computing mesh correspondences throughout the decimation, independent of the UV layout. This combination yields a textured mesh simplification system that is capable of handling arbitrary triangle meshes, achieving to high-quality results on wild inputs without sacrificing the excellent performance on clean inputs. Our method guarantees to avoid common problems in textured mesh simplification, including the prevalent problem of texture bleeding.

Existing learning-based control synthesis relies on training low-level skill policies and explicitly switching with a high-level policy or a hand-designed finite state machine, leading to quasi-static behaviors. In contrast, dynamic tasks such as soccer require the robot to run towards the ball, decelerate to an optimal approach to dribble, and eventually kick a goal - a continuum of smooth motion. To this end, we propose Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies (OGMP) to learn a single policy mastering all the required modes and preferred sequence of transitions to solve uni-object loco-manipulation tasks. We design hybrid automatons as oracles to generate references with continuous dynamics and discrete mode jumps to perform a guided policy optimization through bounded exploration. To enforce learning a desired sequence of mode transitions, we present a task-agnostic preference reward that enhances performance. The proposed approach demonstrates successful loco-manipulation for tasks like soccer and moving boxes omnidirectionally through whole-body control. In soccer, a single policy learns to optimally reach the ball, transition to contact-rich dribbling, and execute successful goal kicks and ball stops.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_aaed5a467f50","title":"PFAttack: Stealthy Attack Bypassing Group Fairness in Federated Learning","content":"arXiv:2410.06509v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Federated learning (FL), integrating group fairness mechanisms, allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model that makes unbiased decisions for different populations grouped by sensitive attributes (e.g., gender and race). Due to its distributed nature, previous studies have demonstrated that FL systems are vulnerable to model poisoning attacks. However, these studies primarily focus on perturbing accuracy, leaving a critical question unexplored: Can an attacker bypass the group fairness mechanisms in FL and manipulate the global model to be biased? The motivations for such an attack vary; an attacker might seek higher accuracy, yet fairness considerations typically limit the accuracy of the global model or aim to cause ethical disruption. To address this question, we design a novel form of attack in FL, termed Profit-driven Fairness Attack (PFAttack), which aims not to degrade global model accuracy but to bypass fairness mechanisms. Our fundamental insight is that group fairness seeks to weaken the dependence of outputs on input attributes related to sensitive information. In the proposed PFAttack, an attacker can recover this dependence through local fine-tuning across various sensitive groups, thereby creating a biased yet accuracy-preserving malicious model and injecting it into FL through model replacement. Compared to attacks targeting accuracy, PFAttack is more stealthy. The malicious model in PFAttack exhibits subtle parameter variations relative to the original global model, making it robust against detection and filtering by Byzantine-resilient aggregations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted for four fair FL frameworks and three Byzantine-resilient aggregations against model poisoning, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealth of PFAttack in bypassing group fairness mechanisms in FL.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06509","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.398757","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":267,"author":"Jiashi Gao, Ziwei Wang, Xiangyu Zhao, Xinming Shi, Xin Yao, Xuetao Wei","raw_content_length":1921,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.335,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PFA","Profit"],"persons":["Stealthy Attack Bypassing Group Fairness"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1920,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PFAttack","Stealthy Attack Bypassing Group Fairness","Federated Learning","arXiv241006509v2","Announce Type","Abstract","Federated learning","group fairness mechanisms","multiple clients","a global model"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Stealthy Attack Bypassing Group Fairness"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PFAttack":2.0,"Stealthy Attack Bypassing Group Fairness":2.0,"Federated Learning":2.0,"arXiv241006509v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Federated learning":1.0,"group fairness mechanisms":1.0,"multiple clients":1.0,"a global model":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7789853791666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5104999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8979,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3439,"joy":0.0103,"surprise":0.0206,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.5714,"anger":0.0301,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on a novel attack vector against fairness mechanisms in federated learning, a technique that *could* be used in climate-related applications.

This creates inherent challenges for access efficiency, load balancing, and directory contention, especially under dynamic and skewed workloads. This paper argues that synchronous updates are overly conservative. We propose SwitchFS with asynchronous metadata updates that allow operations to return early and defer directory updates until reads, both hiding latency and amortizing overhead. The key challenge lies in efficiently maintaining the synchronous POSIX semantics of metadata updates. To address this, SwitchFS is co-designed with a programmable switch, leveraging the limited on-switch resources to track directory states with negligible overhead. This allows SwitchFS to aggregate and apply delayed updates efficiently, using batching and consolidation before directory reads. Evaluation shows that SwitchFS achieves up to 13.34$\\times$ and 3.85$\\times$ higher throughput, and 61.6% and 57.3% lower latency than two state-of-the-art distributed filesystems, Emulated-InfiniFS and Emulated-CFS, respectively, under skewed workloads.

M-Pilot is trained to pivot the outputs of the black-box LLM aligning with preferences during iterative interaction, which enables controllable multi-turn generation and self-improvement in optimizing intermediate guidance.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_292a79971bff","title":"TokenSelect: Efficient Long","content":"arXiv:2411.02886v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Rapid advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred demand for processing extended context sequences in contemporary applications. However, this progress faces two challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues limit LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using QK dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level.

To further accelerate TokenSelect, we design the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented the efficient Paged Dot Product Kernel, significantly reducing the selection overhead.

Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks.

Automatic Cobb angle measurement from X-ray images is crucial for scoliosis screening and diagnosis. However, most existing regression-based and segmentation-based methods struggle with inaccurate spine representations or mask connectivity and fragmentation issues. Besides, landmark-based methods suffer from insufficient training data and annotations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel curvature angle estimation framework named CurvNet including latent contour representation based contour detection and iterative data engine based image self-generation. Specifically, we propose a parameterized spine contour representation in latent space, which enables eigen-spine decomposition and spine contour reconstruction. Latent contour coefficient regression is combined with anchor box classification to solve inaccurate predictions and mask connectivity issues. Moreover, we develop a data engine with image self-generation, automatic annotation, and automatic selection in an iterative manner. By our data engine, we generate a clean dataset named Spinal-AI2024 without privacy leaks, which is the largest released scoliosis X-ray dataset to our knowledge.

However, despite the advantages that STAR-RISs could bring, challenges such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and phase errors may lead to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of EMI and phase errors on STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems and propose techniques to mitigate these effects. We introduce a tailored projected gradient descent (GD) algorithm for STAR-RIS coefficient matrix design by minimizing the local channel estimation normalized mean square error (NMSE). We also derive the novel closed-form expressions of the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) to analyze system performance with EMI and phase errors, in which fractional power control methods are introduced for performance improvement. The results reveal that the projected GD algorithm can effectively tackle EMI and phase errors to improve estimation accuracy and compensate for performance degradation with nearly 30% NMSE improvement and over 10% SE improvement. Moreover, increasing the number of access points (APs), antennas per AP, and STAR-RIS elements can also improve SE performance. However, the advantages of employing STAR-RIS are reduced when EMI and phase errors are severe.

However, creating suitable machine understandable descriptions of the planning domain, problem, and goal requires expertise in the planning language, limiting the utility of these tools for non-expert humans. Recent efforts have explored utilizing a symbolic planner in conjunction with a large language model to generate plans from natural language descriptions given by a non-expert human (LLM+PDDL). Our approach performs initial translation of goal specifications to a set of PDDL goal constraints using an LLM; such translations often result in imprecise symbolic specifications, which are difficult to validate directly.

The primary challenge of ER lies in classifying record pairs as matches or non-matches, which in multi-source ER (MS-ER) scenarios can become complicated due to data source heterogeneity and scalability issues. Existing methods for MS-ER generally require labeled record pairs, and such methods fail to effectively reuse models across multiple ER tasks. We propose MoRER (Model Repositories for Entity Resolution), a novel method for building a model repository consisting of classification models that solve ER problems. By leveraging feature distribution analysis, MoRER clusters similar ER tasks, thereby enabling the effective initialization of a model repository with a moderate labeling effort. Experimental results on three multi-source datasets demonstrate that MoRER achieves comparable or better results to methods that have label-limited budgets, such as active learning and transfer learning approaches, while outperforming self-supervised approaches that utilize large pre-trained language models. When compared to supervised transformer-based methods, MoRER achieves comparable or better results, depending on the training data size. Importantly, MoRER is the first method for building a model repository for ER problems, facilitating the continuous integration of new data sources by reducing the need for generating new training data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09355","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.407788","language":"en","tags":["csdb","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Victor Christen, Peter Christen","raw_content_length":1523,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MS-ER","MoRER"],"persons":["Efficient Model Repository"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1522,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Efficient Model Repository","Entity Resolution","Construction","Search","Integration","matches","arXiv241209355v2","Announce Type","Entity resolution","a fundamental task"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["Search"],"research_academic":["Search"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Efficient Model Repository":2.0,"Entity Resolution":2.0,"Construction":2.0,"Search":2.0,"Integration":2.0,"matches":2.0,"arXiv241209355v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Entity resolution":1.0,"a fundamental task":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7793004497222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9278,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0349,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.004},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel method (MoRER) for building a model repository for entity resolution, which could improve data integration and potentially reduce the need for generating new training data.

By fine-tuning the vision transformer on this small dataset, we significantly improve part-level affordance segmentation, adapting the model's in-context segmentation capabilities to robot manipulation scenarios.

As such, many works choose simple flow architectures that are readily available and do not consider other models. Guidelines for choosing an appropriate architecture would reduce analysis time for practitioners and motivate researchers to take the recommended models as foundations to be improved. We provide the first such guideline by extensively evaluating many normalizing flow architectures on various flow-based MCMC methods and target distributions. When the target density gradient is available, we show that flow-based MCMC outperforms classic MCMC for suitable NF architecture choices with minor hyperparameter tuning. When the gradient is unavailable, flow-based MCMC wins with off-the-shelf architectures. We find contractive residual flows to be the best general-purpose models with relatively low sensitivity to hyperparameter choice. We also provide various insights into normalizing flow behavior within MCMC when varying their hyperparameters, properties of target distributions, and the overall computational budget.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17136","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.409484","language":"en","tags":["statml","statco","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"David Nabergoj, Erik \\v{S}trumbelj","raw_content_length":1314,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MCMC","Markov Chain Monte Carlo arXiv:2412.17136v2"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1313,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Empirical evaluation","normalizing flows","Markov Chain Monte Carlo","Announce Type","Abstract","Recent advances","precondition target distributions","distant regions","no systematic comparison","different normalizing flow architectures"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Empirical evaluation":2.0,"normalizing flows":2.0,"Markov Chain Monte Carlo":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"precondition target distributions":1.0,"distant regions":1.0,"no systematic comparison":1.0,"different normalizing flow architectures":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7793577858333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9128,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0237,"sadness":0.0146,"fear":0.0122,"anger":0.0147,"disgust":0.0155},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a systematic comparison of normalizing flow architectures for MCMC, which can improve the efficiency of simulations used in various fields, including climate modeling.

Existing methods often rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and limiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph Condensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient approach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the condensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution of predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and resource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the capability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we derive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural information. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input nodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the challenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs, Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency matrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the adjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the application of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph structures.

Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA.

While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community.

Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems.

Latent drivers, such as atmospheric processes, play a critical role in temporal dynamics, while direct causal influences also exist among geographically proximate observed variables. Traditional Causal Representation Learning (CRL) typically focuses on latent factors but overlooks such observable-to-observable causal relations, limiting its applicability to climate analysis. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that jointly uncovers (i) causal relations among observed variables and (ii) latent driving forces together with their interactions. We establish conditions under which both the hidden dynamic processes and the causal structure among observed variables are simultaneously identifiable from time-series data. Remarkably, our guarantees hold even in the nonparametric setting, leveraging contextual information to recover latent variables and causal relations. Building on these insights, we propose CaDRe (Causal Discovery and Representation learning), a time-series generative model with structural constraints that integrates CRL and causal discovery. Experiments on synthetic datasets validate our theoretical results. On real-world climate datasets, CaDRe not only delivers competitive forecasting accuracy but also recovers visualized causal graphs aligned with domain expertise, thereby offering interpretable insights into climate systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12500","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.412711","language":"en","tags":["statme","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Minghao Fu, Biwei Huang, Zijian Li, Yujia Zheng, Ignavier Ng, Guangyi Chen, Yingyao Hu, Kun Zhang","raw_content_length":1556,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CRL","Hidden Dynamic Process for Climate Analysis arXiv:2501.12500v2 Announce Type","Traditional Causal Representation Learning"],"persons":["Causal Structures"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1555,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Learning","General Causal Structures","Hidden Dynamic Process","Climate Analysis","arXiv250112500v2 Announce Type","Abstract","climate dynamics","correlations","observational data","their underlying causal process"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Learning":2.0,"General Causal Structures":2.0,"Hidden Dynamic Process":2.0,"Climate Analysis":2.0,"arXiv250112500v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"climate dynamics":1.0,"correlations":1.0,"observational data":1.0,"their underlying causal process":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7794712816666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8705,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0524,"sadness":0.0099,"fear":0.0258,"anger":0.0204,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new framework (CaDRe) for uncovering causal relationships in climate data, including latent factors.

To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework. FedGKC introduces a lightweight Copilot Model on each client to facilitate knowledge exchange while local architectures are heterogeneous across clients, and employs two complementary mechanisms: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which transfers effective knowledge between local and copilot models through bidirectional distillation with multi-view perturbation; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which dynamically assigns aggregation weights based on knowledge provided by clients.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as primary optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary optimizer (EVO) and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-based operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLMs outputs. Moreover, we explore a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based EVO. Our findings present perspectives on integrating LLMs into evolutionary computation and discuss paths that may support scalable and context-aware optimization in networked systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15081","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.414032","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csne","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Jie Zhao, Tao Wen, Kang Hao Cheong","raw_content_length":1615,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1614,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Large Language Models","LLMs","Evolutionary Optimizers","Network","arXiv250115081v4 Announce Type","strong capabilities","language understanding","reasoning","diverse domains","interest"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","Network"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Large Language Models":3.0,"LLMs":3.0,"Evolutionary Optimizers":2.0,"Network":2.0,"arXiv250115081v4 Announce Type":1.0,"strong capabilities":1.0,"language understanding":1.0,"reasoning":1.0,"diverse domains":1.0,"interest":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7795138844444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.124,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8248,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9112,"joy":0.0163,"surprise":0.028,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0208,"anger":0.0116,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores using LLMs for network optimization, a potentially useful tool for various sustainability applications.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f3832215ecd3","title":"One","content":"arXiv:2501.18502v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with $1$-bit communication constraints when the variance is unknown. We focus on the specific case where each user has access to one i.i.d. sample drawn from a distribution that belongs to a scale-location family, and is limited to sending just a single bit of information to a central server whose goal is to estimate the mean. We propose simple non-adaptive and adaptive protocols that are shown to be asymptotically normal. We derive bounds on the asymptotic (in the number of users) Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved by these protocols. For a class of symmetric log-concave distributions, we derive matching lower bounds for the MSE achieved by adaptive protocols, proving the optimality of our scheme. Furthermore, we develop a lower bound on the MSE for non-adaptive protocols that applies to any symmetric strictly log-concave distribution by means of a refined squared Hellinger distance analysis. Through this, we show that for many common distributions including a subclass of the generalized Gaussian family, the asymptotic minimax MSE achieved by the best non-adaptive protocol is higher than that achieved by our simple adaptive protocol. Our simulation results confirm a positive gap between the adaptive and non-adaptive settings, aligning with the theoretical bounds.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18502","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.414458","language":"en","tags":["statth","mathit","computer-science","preprints","csit","mathst","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Ritesh Kumar, Shashank Vatedka","raw_content_length":1402,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MSE"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["1$-bit"]},"char_count":1401,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv250118502v3 Announce Type","Abstract","this work","the problem","distributed mean estimation","1-bit communication constraints","the variance","the specific case","each user","access"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["1-bit communication constraints"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv250118502v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this work":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"distributed mean estimation":1.0,"1-bit communication constraints":1.0,"the variance":1.0,"the specific case":1.0,"each user":1.0,"access":1.0}},"age_hours":2.779529243055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8137,"joy":0.0504,"surprise":0.1147,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.007,"disgust":0.002},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical improvements in distributed mean estimation with 1-bit communication constraints.
