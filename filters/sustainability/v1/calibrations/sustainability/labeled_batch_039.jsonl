{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_a237721323ba","title":"Aurora: a mobile","content":"BackgroundAnxiety and depression are leading contributors to disability worldwide. In Mexico, an upper-middle-income country (UMIC) with health-system constraints resembling those of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), access to psychotherapy remains limited. Digital therapeutics provide a scalable approach to bridging this gap. Aurora is a Spanish-language, self-guided mobile application delivering cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through eight interactive modules. This study evaluated its feasibility, usability, and preliminary clinical impact among pharmacologically treated adults with anxiety and depression.MethodsWe conducted a mixed-methods, pre–post feasibility study in Mexico between March and October 2024. Participants were 46 adults (18–45 years) with psychiatrist-confirmed mild-to-moderate anxiety and/or depression on stable pharmacotherapy; 38 (82.6%) completed baseline and follow-up. Usability was assessed with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the user Mobile App Rating Scale (uMARS). Symptoms were measured with the Spanish Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS). The number of modules completed defined engagement, categorized as follows: low (0–2), moderate (3–5), and high (6–7). Analyses included paired t-tests, non-parametric trend tests, correlations, and adjusted regressions.ResultsAnxiety scores decreased from 13.2 (SD 5.6) to 10.6 (SD 5.1) (t(37) = 3.81, p = 0.001; d = 0.49), and depression scores from 11.1 (SD 5.2) to 8.4 (SD 4.9) (t(37) = 4.75, p < 0.001; d = 0.54). Engagement showed a graded dose–response: high-engagement users (n = 17) achieved larger reductions (Δ anxiety = −3.9; Δ depression = −4.0) than low-engagement users (Δ anxiety = −0.9; Δ depression = −1.0). Regression confirmed each additional module predicted incremental reductions in both anxiety (β = −0.38, p = 0.009) and depression (β = −0.41, p = 0.006).

To enhance recognition performance, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion neural network based on a multimodal multi-head attention fusion neural network (MMHA-FNN). This method utilizes differential entropy (DE) and bilinear interpolation features as inputs, learning the spatial–temporal characteristics of brain regions through an MBConv-based module. By incorporating the Transformer-based multi-head self-attention mechanism, we dynamically model the dependencies between EEG and facial expression features, enabling adaptive weighting and deep interaction of cross-modal characteristics. The experiment conducted a four-classification task on the MED-HI dataset (15 subjects, 300 trials). The taxonomy included happy, sad, fear, and calmness, where ‘calmness’ corresponds to a low-arousal neutral state as defined in the MED-HI protocol. Results indicate that the proposed method achieved an average accuracy of 81.14%, significantly outperforming feature concatenation (71.02%) and decision layer fusion (69.45%).

This paper introduces a signal–data dual-domain cooperative antijamming and localization (SDCAL) framework that integrates adaptive complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with improved blind source separation and wavelet optimization (CEEMDAN-WOBSS) for signal-level denoising and separation. Following source separation, CFAR-based pulse compression is applied for precise range estimation, and multi-node data fusion is then used to achieve three-dimensional target localization. Under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, the adaptive CEEMDAN–WOBSS approach reconstructs the signal covariance matrix to preserve subspace rank, thereby accelerating convergence of the separation matrix. The subsequent pulse compression and CFAR detection steps provide reliable inter-node distance measurements for accurate fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared to conventional blind-source-separation methods, the proposed framework markedly enhances interference suppression, detection probability, and localization accuracy—validating its effectiveness for robust collaborative sensing in challenging jamming scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6277","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.002884","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Yongquan You","raw_content_length":1337,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SNR","CEEMDAN","CEEMDAN-WOBSS","CFAR"],"persons":["Phased Mainlobe","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1307,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Mainlobe interference","the performance","distributed phased-array radar systems","the presence","strong jamming","low-reflectivity targets","This paper","SDCAL"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Mainlobe interference"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Mainlobe interference":1.0,"the performance":1.0,"distributed phased-array radar systems":1.0,"the presence":1.0,"strong jamming":1.0,"low-reflectivity targets":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"SDCAL":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974101271111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.728,"joy":0.0092,"surprise":0.0296,"sadness":0.0339,"fear":0.0591,"anger":0.0541,"disgust":0.0861},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel signal processing framework for improving radar performance in challenging environments.

However, conventional location-based accessibility measures typically rely on average travel times as the sole temporal metric, neglecting detailed travel time distributions. Consequently, these methods yield identical accessibility values for study zones with the same mean travel time but different travel time variations. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel approach that explicitly integrates the probability density distributions of travel times, modelling the impact of travel time variability on accessibility. We applied the proposed method using GPS data collected from taxis in Harbin, China, and compared its outcomes with those from existing potential accessibility calculations. Across all 103 study zones in Harbin, the existing method underestimated the accessibility by 6–28%, with an average underestimation of 17% when benchmarked against the new method. These inaccuracies also impaired the identification of urban areas with the lowest accessibility levels, leading to the misclassification of 20% of problematic zones. The findings highlight the limitations of existing methods, which produce biassed accessibility estimations and misleading results. In contrast, the proposed travel time variability-integrated accessibility measure demonstrates greater sensitivity to actual traffic conditions, providing a more accurate and objective assessment of network performance.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6274","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.003222","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Mario Cools","raw_content_length":1508,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["Harbin","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1498,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","The Development","a New Location","Accessibility","a key dimension","sustainable transport network management","planning","conventional location-based accessibility measures","average travel times"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["The Development"],"ai_ml":["sustainable transport network management"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Development":2.0,"a New Location":2.0,"Accessibility":1.0,"a key dimension":1.0,"sustainable transport network management":1.0,"planning":1.0,"conventional location-based accessibility measures":1.0,"average travel times":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974116772499999,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.4885,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9498,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0176,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0064,"disgust":0.0075},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for assessing accessibility in transportation networks by integrating travel time variability.

However, it remains a highly challenging task due to the fleeting duration, low intensity, and limited availability of annotated data. Most existing approaches rely solely on either appearance or motion cues, thereby restricting their ability to capture expressive information fully. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight multi-modal fusion network, termed M3ENet, which integrates both motion and appearance cues through early-stage feature fusion. Specifically, our model extracts horizontal, vertical, and strain-based optical flow between the onset and apex frames, alongside RGB images from the onset, apex, and offset frames. These inputs are processed by two modality-specific subnetworks, whose features are fused to exploit complementary information for robust classification.

Traditional pavement evaluation methods focus on skid resistance and texture but do not account for the surface’s mechanical aggressiveness during a fall. To address this gap, the proposed test simulates fall conditions by dragging a paraffin wax specimen—used as a low-cost and reproducible proxy to approximate the abrasive response that could affect human skin—over pavement at a controlled speed and load, quantifying material loss as an indicator of surface abrasiveness. The method was validated on three pavement types (smooth ceramic, bituminous, and concrete), demonstrating its sensitivity and repeatability. Unlike conventional point-based tests, it enables continuous evaluation along a predefined length, offering more representative results. A full-scale case study on a micromobility-dedicated bike lane confirmed the test’s responsiveness to surface changes over time. Results suggest the method is practical, reproducible, and applicable to a wide range of pavements. Beyond micromobility, it can be extended to other vulnerable users, such as motorcyclists. The test represents a new metric for infrastructure safety audits focused on injury mitigation.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6275","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.004440","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Alfredo García","raw_content_length":1411,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1371,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","A Novel Pavement Abrasion Test","Injury Risk","Vulnerable Road Users","This study","the injury potential","pavement surfaces","vulnerable road users","micromobility users"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Novel Pavement Abrasion Test":2.0,"Injury Risk":2.0,"Vulnerable Road Users":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the injury potential":1.0,"pavement surfaces":1.0,"vulnerable road users":1.0,"micromobility users":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974182236944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.112,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7776,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8179,"joy":0.0081,"surprise":0.0127,"sadness":0.0111,"fear":0.0831,"anger":0.0275,"disgust":0.0395},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel pavement abrasion test validated on three pavement types, demonstrating sensitivity and repeatability.

Traditional seismic intensity prediction methods rely on seismograph equipment, which is limited by slow response times and high equipment costs. In this study, we introduce a low-computational-cost transformer-based (LCCTV) visual tracking method to predict seismic intensity in surveillance videos. To this end, an earthquake video dataset is proposed. It is captured in the laboratory environment, where the seismic level is obtained through seismic station simulation. With the proposed dataset, a low-computational-cost transformer-based visual tracking method is first proposed to estimate the movement trajectory of the calibration board target in videos in real time. In order to further improve the recognition accuracy, we then utilize a Butterworth filter to smooth the generated movement trajectory so as to remove low-frequency interference signals. Finally, the seismic intensity is predicted based on the velocity and acceleration derived from the smoothed movement trajectory. Experimental results demonstrated that the LCCTV outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches. The findings confirm that the proposed LCCTV can serve as a low-cost, scalable solution for seismic intensity analysis.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6269","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.005080","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Yamin Han","raw_content_length":1340,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LCCTV"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1340,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Seismic Intensity Prediction","a Low-Computational","seismic intensity","The prediction","an accurate and timely manner","scientific guidance","disaster relief","Traditional seismic intensity prediction methods"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Seismic Intensity Prediction":2.0,"a Low-Computational":2.0,"seismic intensity":2.0,"The prediction":1.0,"an accurate and timely manner":1.0,"scientific guidance":1.0,"disaster relief":1.0,"Traditional seismic intensity prediction methods":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974218859722223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8706,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0166,"sadness":0.0112,"fear":0.0755,"anger":0.0126,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a low-computational-cost method for predicting seismic intensity using surveillance videos.

A motivating scenario involves healthcare networks where regional hospitals submit aggregated medical data to blockchain systems while maintaining strict information security—often designating one gateway per region for external communication. Long geographical distances between smart terminals stress traditional consensus with excessive network overhead and limited efficiency. To address this, we propose a layered BFT consensus method, 2-layer EaZy BFT (2EZBFT). The system forms multiple independent groups of smart terminals and builds a two-layer consensus architecture—“intra-group synchronization, inter-group consensus”—to complete cross-group data aggregation and final on-chain consensus. This layered design reduces intra-group communication complexity by lowering the number of nodes per group and reduces cross-group interactions via leader-side aggregation, thereby lowering overall network overhead. Compared with other BFT algorithms, the proposed scheme improves the efficiency of data collection and on-chain reporting while ensuring consensus security and consistency. Experiments show improvements in metrics such as network overhead and consensus latency. In a discrete-event simulation with an asymmetric WAN latency matrix and geo-partitioned groups, 2EZBFT achieves up to 45% higher throughput than flat BFT algorithms such as PBFT and HotStuff under high load. It provides a practical path for efficient data interaction in decentralized oracles and offers guidance for improving the performance of blockchain–real-world data exchange.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6268","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.005451","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Kun She","raw_content_length":1771,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BFT"],"persons":["Vol","EaZy BFT"],"locations":["communica"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1711,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","2EZBFT","Decentralized Oracle Consensus","Distant Smart Terminals","smart terminals","geo-distributed deployments","sensor data","the coordination","chain"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["chain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"2EZBFT":2.0,"Decentralized Oracle Consensus":2.0,"Distant Smart Terminals":2.0,"smart terminals":2.0,"geo-distributed deployments":1.0,"sensor data":1.0,"the coordination":1.0,"chain":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974234224444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.1125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8225,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.827,"joy":0.0303,"surprise":0.0092,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0378,"anger":0.0483,"disgust":0.0427},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel consensus mechanism (2EZBFT) that improves the efficiency of data collection and on-chain reporting in decentralized oracles.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_94876693f6c4","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6267: Curvature","content":"Existing point cloud registration methods can effectively handle large-scale and partially overlapping point cloud pairs. However, registering unbalanced point cloud pairs with significant disparities in spatial extent and point density remains a challenging problem that has received limited research attention. This challenge primarily arises from the difficulty in achieving accurate local registration when the point clouds exhibit substantial scale variations and uneven density distributions. This paper presents a novel registration method for unbalanced point cloud pairs that utilizes the local point cluster structure feature for effective outlier rejection. The fundamental principle underlying our method is that the internal structure of a local cluster comprising a point and its K-nearest neighbors maintains rigidity-preserved invariance across different point clouds. The proposed pipeline operates through four sequential stages. First, keypoints are detected in both the source and target point clouds. Second, local feature descriptors are employed to establish initial one-to-many correspondences, which is a strategy that increases correspondences redundancy to enhance the pool of potential inliers. Third, the proposed Local Point Cluster Structure Feature is applied to filter outliers from the initial correspondences. Finally, the transformation hypothesis is generated and evaluated through the RANSAC method. To validate the efficacy of the proposed method, we construct a carefully designed benchmark named KITTI-UPP (KITTI-Unbalanced Point cloud Pairs) based on the KITTI odometry dataset. We further evaluate our method on the real-world TIESY Dataset which is a LiDAR-scanned dataset collected by the Third Railway Survey and Design Institute Group Co. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both registration success rate and computational efficiency on the KITTI-UPP benchmark. Moreover, it achieves competitive results on the real-world TIESY dataset, confirming its applicability and generalizability across diverse real-world scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6267","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.005770","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":288,"author":"Siwen Quan","raw_content_length":2152,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.44,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2152,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Existing point","registration methods","unbalanced point cloud","significant disparities","spatial extent","point density","a challenging problem","limited research attention"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["limited research attention"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Existing point":1.0,"registration methods":1.0,"unbalanced point cloud":1.0,"significant disparities":1.0,"spatial extent":1.0,"point density":1.0,"a challenging problem":1.0,"limited research attention":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974248870833334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.608499999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1217,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.929,"joy":0.0033,"surprise":0.0176,"sadness":0.0134,"fear":0.0161,"anger":0.0135,"disgust":0.007},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for point cloud registration, which could improve the efficiency of LiDAR data processing.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_bd286bb4911e","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6265: Joint Trajectory and IRS Phase Shift Optimization for Dual IRS","content":"Intelligent reflecting surface-assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (IRS-UAVs) have been widely applied in various communication scenarios. This paper addressed the uplink communication problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by proposing a novel double IRS-UAVs assisted framework to improve the pairwise sum rate. Specifically, nodes with relatively short signal transmission distances upload signals via a single-reflection link, while nodes with relatively long distances upload signals through a dual-reflection link involving two IRSs. Within each work cycle, the IRS-UAVs followed a fixed service sequence to cyclically assist all sensor node pairs. We designed a joint optimization algorithm that simultaneously optimized the UAV trajectories and IRS phase shifts to maximize the pairwise sum rate while guaranteeing each node’s transmission rate meets a minimum quality of service (QoS) constraint. Specifically, we introduce slack variables to linearize the inherently nonlinear constraints arising from interdependent variables, thereby transforming each subproblem into a more manageable form.

To address this issue, an accurate method for identifying abnormal vibrations in a metro reserve based on spatially correlated dense measurement points is proposed. First, by arranging distributed optical fibers along the longitudinal length of a tunnel, dynamic strain vibration signals are extracted via phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation analysis are used to jointly downscale the dynamic strain features. On this basis, a spatial correlation between the calculated values of the features of the target measurement points to be updated and its adjacent measurement points is constructed, and the spatial correlation credibility of the dynamic strain features between the dense measurement points and the target measurement points to be updated is calculated via quadratic function weighting and kernel density estimation methods. The weights are calculated, and the eigenvalues of the target measurement points are updated on the basis of the correlation credibility weights between the adjacent measurement points. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation (BP) identification model for the eigenvalues of the target measurement points are constructed to identify the dynamic strain eigenvalues of the abnormal vibrations in the underground tunnel. Numerical simulations and an experiment in an actual tunnel verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6266","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.006398","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Liang Gao","raw_content_length":1736,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Basis of the Spatial Correlation of Dynamic Strain","cor"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1736,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Abnormal Vibration Identification","Metro Tunnels","the Basis","the Spatial Correlation","Dynamic Strain","Dense Measurement Points","Distributed Sensing Optical Fibers","abnormal vibrations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dynamic Strain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Abnormal Vibration Identification":2.0,"Metro Tunnels":2.0,"the Basis":2.0,"the Spatial Correlation":2.0,"Dynamic Strain":2.0,"Dense Measurement Points":2.0,"Distributed Sensing Optical Fibers":2.0,"abnormal vibrations":2.0}},"age_hours":12.974282059722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1178,"joy":0.0032,"surprise":0.0091,"sadness":0.0504,"fear":0.7611,"anger":0.0382,"disgust":0.0202},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a method for identifying abnormal vibrations in metro tunnels using distributed optical fibers and statistical analysis.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_fdb2f927a05f","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6263: Collision","content":"With the rapid advancement of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in industrial automation and intelligent logistics, achieving efficient and safe path planning in dynamic environments has become a critical challenge. These environments require robots to perceive complex scenarios and adapt their motion strategies accordingly, often under real-time constraints. Existing methods frequently struggle to balance efficiency, responsiveness, and safety, especially in the presence of continuously changing dynamic obstacles. While Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have each shown promise in this domain, they also face limitations when applied individually—such as high computational demands or insufficient environmental exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid path planning framework that integrates an optimized DRL algorithm with MPC. We replace the Actor’s output with a learnable noisy linear layer whose mean and scale parameters are optimized jointly with the policy via backpropagation, thereby enhancing exploration while preserving training stability. TD3 produces stepwise control commands that evolve into a short-horizon reference trajectory, while MPC refines this trajectory through constraint-aware optimization to ensure timely obstacle avoidance. This complementary process combines TD3′s learning-based adaptability with MPC’s reliable local feasibility. Extensive experiments conducted in environments with varying obstacle dynamics and densities demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves obstacle avoidance success rate, trajectory smoothness, and path accuracy compared to traditional MPC, standalone DRL, and other hybrid approaches, offering a robust and efficient solution for autonomous navigation in complex scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6263","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:42.006995","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Jing Ji","raw_content_length":1856,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Model Predictive Control","Deep Reinforcement Learning","DRL","Autonomous Mobile Robots","MPC"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1816,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Collision","the rapid advancement","Autonomous Mobile Robots","AMRs","industrial automation","intelligent logistics","efficient and safe path planning","dynamic environments"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["industrial automation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Collision":2.0,"the rapid advancement":1.0,"Autonomous Mobile Robots":1.0,"AMRs":1.0,"industrial automation":1.0,"intelligent logistics":1.0,"efficient and safe path planning":1.0,"dynamic environments":1.0}},"age_hours":12.974312953055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3445,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8689,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8291,"joy":0.0032,"surprise":0.0226,"sadness":0.0157,"fear":0.079,"anger":0.0329,"disgust":0.0174},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a hybrid path planning framework for autonomous mobile robots, integrating DRL and MPC.

The system runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 to enable future IoT integration and reduce costs. The system also uses the official camera module v2 and 7-inch touchscreen. Frame preprocessing uses MediaPipe to assign hand coordinates, and NumPy tools to normalise them. A machine learning model then predicts the gesture. The model, a feed-forward network consisting of five fully connected layers, was built using Keras 3 and compiled with TensorFlow Lite. Training data utilised the HaGRIDv2 dataset, modified to consist of 15 one-handed gestures from its original of 23 one- and two-handed gestures. When used to train the model, validation metrics of 0.90 accuracy and 0.31 loss were returned.

Recently, leading nations including the United States and China have increasingly turned to IPs to protect and promote their domestic corporate interests. They use both offensive and defensive tools such as tariffs, trade barriers, investment restrictions, and financial support measures. To evaluate how these policy announcements may affect national interests, many countries have implemented logistic regression models to automatically classify them as either IP or non-IP. This study proposes ensemble models—widely recognized for their superior performance in binary classification—as a more effective alternative. The random forest model (a bagging technique) and boosting methods (gradient boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM) are proposed, and their performance is compared with that of logistic regression. For evaluation, a dataset of 2000 randomly selected policy documents was compiled and labeled by domain experts. Following data preprocessing, hyperparameter optimization was performed using the Optuna library in Python. To enhance model robustness, cross-validation was applied, and performance was evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The analytical results demonstrate that ensemble models consistently outperform logistic regression in both baseline (default hyperparameters) and optimized configurations. Compared to logistic regression, LightGBM and random forest showed baseline accuracy improvements of 3.5% and 3.8%, respectively, with hyperparameter optimization yielding additional performance gains of 2.4–3.3% across ensemble methods. In particular, the analysis based on alternative performance indicators confirmed that the LightGBM and random forest models yielded the most reliable predictions.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/3974","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:46.247153","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Hee-Seon Jang","raw_content_length":1925,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GTA","the United Nations","XGBoost","non-IP","IPs"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["the United States","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1895,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Ensemble Learning Model","Industrial Policy Classification","Automated Hyperparameter Optimization","The Global Trade Alert GTA website","the United Nations","a large number","industrial policy","IP announcements"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Ensemble Learning Model":2.0,"Industrial Policy Classification":2.0,"Automated Hyperparameter Optimization":2.0,"The Global Trade Alert GTA website":1.0,"the United Nations":1.0,"a large number":1.0,"industrial policy":1.0,"IP announcements":1.0}},"age_hours":12.975052094444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.593,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9186,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7921,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0073,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0762,"anger":0.0772,"disgust":0.0356},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents an ensemble learning model for classifying industrial policies, which could indirectly support sustainability by enabling better analysis of policies that promote or hinder sustainable development.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_9c936e1294fb","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 3973: TrackRISC: An Implicit Attack Flow Model and Hardware Microarchitectural Mitigation for Speculative Cache","content":"Speculative execution attacks significantly compromise the security of modern processors by enabling information leakage. These well-known attacks exploit speculative cache-based covert channels to effectively exfiltrate secret data by altering cache states. Existing hardware defenses specifically designed to prevent cache-based covert channels are effective at blocking explicit channels. However, their protection against implicit attack variants remains limited, since these hardware defenses do not fully eliminate secret-dependent microarchitectural changes in caches. In this paper, we propose TrackRISC, a framework which comprises (i) a refined implicit attack flow model specifically for the exploration and analysis of implicit cache-based speculative execution attacks which severely compromise the security of existing hardware defenses, and (ii) a security-enhanced tracking and mitigation microarchitecture, termed TrackRISC-Defense, designed to mitigate both implicit and explicit attack variants that use speculative cache-based covert channels. To obtain realistic hardware evaluation results, we implement and evaluate both TrackRISC-Defense and a representative existing defense on top of the Berkeley’s out-of-order RISC-V processor core (SonicBOOM) using the VCU118 FPGA platform running Linux. Compared to the representative existing defense which incurs a performance overhead of 13.8%, TrackRISC-Defense ensures stronger security guarantees with a performance overhead of 19.4%. In addition, TrackRISC-Defense can mitigate both explicit and implicit speculative cache-based covert channels with a register-based hardware resource overhead of 0.4%.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/3973","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:46.247802","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Ray C.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_2c8b374007f6","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 8986: Exploring Factors That Drive Millet Farmers to Join Millet FPOs for Sustainable Development: An ISM Approach","content":"Agriculture and its allied activities contribute to the primary sector in India and act as the basis for the country’s economy. Available agricultural landholdings are scattered as multiple plots across the country. Land fragmentation has led to problems achieving economies of scale and economies of scope; lower productivity, efficiency, and modernization; loss of biodiversity; and little scope for mechanization and technology. FPOs are small clusters of farmers who collaborate to enhance their bargaining strength through collective procurement, processing, and marketing efforts. To enhance the performance of FPOs at the grassroots level, the engagement of cluster-based business organizations (CBBOs) is vital. Millet FPOs are similar to voluntary farmer groups that are involved in the cultivation and promotion of millets. IIMR-promoted millet FPOs were selected purposively for the present study as they are involved in millet cultivation and farming. A total of 450 millet farmers from 15 FPOs and 3 states were randomly chosen for this action research study. The present research identified 10 key factors and collected farmers’ opinions toward member participation in millet FPOs using interpretive structural modeling. The ISM approach provided a clear understanding of how the selected factors interconnect hierarchically with each other as foundational drivers and dependent outcomes. The results from the MICMAC analysis demonstrated that foundational interventions, such as post-harvest technology availability (V2) and knowledge transfer by KVKs (V5), directly support higher-level objectives. Intermediate factors like economies of scale (V1) and market and credit linkages (V3) transform these services into operational advantages, while the outcome factors of business planning (V8), FPO branding (V7), and bargaining power (V9) emerge as dependent variables. The model demonstrates that V2 catalyzes improvements across the production, market, and institutional domains, cascading through intermediate enablers (V1, V4, V5, V6) to strengthen outcomes (V3, V7, V8, V9, V10). This hierarchy demonstrates that investing in post-harvest technology and complementary extension services is critical for building resilient millet FPOs and enhancing member participation.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8986","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:46.411659","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":318,"author":"Tara Satyavathi C","raw_content_length":2308,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.59,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["An ISM Approach Agriculture"],"persons":[],"locations":["India"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2288,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Factors","That Drive Millet Farmers","Millet FPOs","Sustainable Development","An ISM Approach","economies","Agriculture","its allied activities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Sustainable Development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Factors":2.0,"That Drive Millet Farmers":2.0,"Millet FPOs":2.0,"Sustainable Development":2.0,"An ISM Approach":2.0,"economies":2.0,"Agriculture":1.0,"its allied activities":1.0}},"age_hours":12.975403158333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.194,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8807,"joy":0.0108,"surprise":0.0215,"sadness":0.0177,"fear":0.0298,"anger":0.0259,"disgust":0.0136},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies key factors influencing farmer participation in millet FPOs, which can contribute to sustainable agriculture.

The integration of IoT technologies, particularly long-range low-power networks such as LoRaWAN, enables energy-efficient communication between vehicles and road infrastructure, supporting the sustainability goals of smart cities. However, the widespread deployment of IoT devices also introduces significant cybersecurity risks that may compromise the safety, reliability, and long-term sustainability of transportation systems. To address this challenge, we propose a method for generating synthetic network data that simulates normal traffic and DDoS attacks by randomly selecting distribution parameters for features like packets per second and unique device addresses, enabling evaluation of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) using F1-score and AUC metrics in a controlled environment.

Grounded in the education-led development perspective, we posit that a gap is “reasonable” when education disparities are smaller than contemporaneous economic disparities. Based on this concept, this study develops a Development Equilibrium Index (DEI) framework. Using panel data for 31 Chinese provinces from 2003 to 2020, we find the following: (i) N-DEI is positive in most years, indicating that, overall, education gaps are smaller than economic gaps—consistent with higher education’s leading role in compressing economic gaps and supporting sustainability; (ii) At the provincial level, only 4 of 31 provinces (12.9%) show negative P-DEI, while the vast majority are positive, suggesting more supportive conditions to sustainable development. Furthermore, a median-based quadrant analysis for 2020 groups the 31 provinces into seven descriptive types, helping to interpret the variations in P-DEI signs and magnitudes and to inform targeted policy recommendations. The DEI thus reframes assessment from “narrowing gaps per se” to the goal of keeping education gaps below economic ones, providing a concise diagnostic tool for planning cohesive, resilient higher-education systems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8984","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:46.412476","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Haotian Xu","raw_content_length":1436,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Promoting Sustainable Development of Inter How","P-DEI","DEI"],"persons":[],"locations":["sustai"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1376,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Sustainable Development","Inter","inter-regional gaps","higher-education development","a reasonable range","a shared global challenge","the literature","zero gap"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Sustainable Development","higher-education development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Sustainable Development":2.0,"Inter":2.0,"inter-regional gaps":1.0,"higher-education development":1.0,"a reasonable range":1.0,"a shared global challenge":1.0,"the literature":1.0,"zero gap":1.0}},"age_hours":12.975435655555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9049,"joy":0.0131,"surprise":0.0206,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0305,"disgust":0.02},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a Development Equilibrium Index (DEI) framework and applies it to panel data from 31 Chinese provinces.

This study investigates the in vitro biodegradation of LDPE by native Aspergillus strains isolated from plastic-contaminated soils in Trujillo, Peru. Molecular techniques were used to identify the Aspergillus species. The LDPE strips were incubated for 50 days, and biodegradation was evaluated by weight loss (%), pH variation, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Likewise, the reduction rate and half-life of the polymer (t1/2) were calculated. Three strains of Aspergillus—A. niger H1C, A. ochraceopetaliformis H3C, and A. tamarii H6C—were isolated and evaluated for their ability to LDPE under in vitro conditions. A. niger H1C exhibited the most weight reduction (4.25 ± 1.67%) and a polymer half-life of 897.89 days, while A. tamarii H6C demonstrated a comparable loss (3.79 ± 1.52%) with a half-life of 901.6 days. A. ochraceopetaliformis H3C exhibited a moderate degradation (1.98 ± 0.37%), with the longest half-life recorded at 1757.33 days. The process was supported by pH variations. Furthermore, FTIR and SEM analyses revealed structural modifications in LDPE including formation of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and ether groups, suggesting oxidative and enzymatic activity-possibly mediated by lipases induced under lipid-rich conditions.

By integrating spatial analysis techniques, unmanned vehicle aerial photography, field surveys, and multitemporal data from 2000 to 2023, this study analyzed the heritage value of traditional villages and explored a rural-adaptable pathway for HUL implementation. Findings showed: 1. Based on the temporal and spatial evaluation analysis logic of landscapes under the HUL framework, spatial patterns of the village, such as vegetation growth and reduced in water bodies, have been quantitatively identified, revealing the interaction patterns of a complex ecosystem. 2. Following HUL’s holistic understanding of heritage value, the three-dimensional value characteristics of the village (landscape, function, and spirit) are clarified. 3. By implementing the community participation mechanism of HUL, through villager-led inheritance of intangible cultural heritage and joint formulation of conservation conventions, the living continuity of heritage has been realized. The HUL approach shows remarkable adaptability, with prominent achievements in dynamic-layered protection and community participation. This study breaks through the urban bias of the HUL approach, enriches understanding of rural heritage, and provides a practical paradigm for promoting sustainable development of similar villages.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8981","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:46.413144","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Xiangting He","raw_content_length":1443,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HUL","Assessment and Protection of Heritage Value of Traditional Villages","the Perspective of Historic Urban Landscape","the Historic Urban Landscape"],"persons":[],"locations":["Huaqiu Village"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1433,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Huaqiu Village","Sustainability","Pages","Assessment","Protection","Heritage Value","Traditional Villages","the Perspective","Historic Urban Landscape","A Case Study"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"research_academic":["A Case Study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Huaqiu Village":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Assessment":2.0,"Protection":2.0,"Heritage Value":2.0,"Traditional Villages":2.0,"the Perspective":2.0,"Historic Urban Landscape":2.0,"A Case Study":2.0}},"age_hours":12.975469527222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8903,"joy":0.0239,"surprise":0.0217,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0144,"anger":0.0236,"disgust":0.0188},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study analyzes spatial patterns in Huaqiu Village from 2000-2023, identifying vegetation growth and reduced water bodies.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_94673b75d5d6","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 8979: Stylometric Analysis of Sustainable Central Bank Communications: Revealing Authorial Signatures in Monetary Policy Statements","content":"Sustainable economic development requires transparent and consistent institutional communication from monetary authorities to maintain long-term financial stability and public trust. This study investigates the latent authorial structure and stylistic heterogeneity of central bank communications by applying stylometric analysis and unsupervised machine learning to official announcements of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT). Using a dataset of 557 press releases from 2006 to 2017, we extract a range of linguistic features at both sentence and document levels—including sentence length, punctuation density, word length, and type–token ratios. These features are reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustered via Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC), revealing three distinct authorial groups within the CBRT’s communications. The robustness of these clusters is validated using multidimensional scaling (MDS) on character-level and word-level n-gram distances. The analysis finds consistent stylistic differences between clusters, with implications for authorship attribution, tone variation, and communication strategy. Notably, sentiment analysis indicates that one authorial cluster tends to exhibit more negative tonal features, suggesting potential bias or divergence in internal communication style. These findings challenge the conventional assumption of institutional homogeneity and highlight the presence of distinct communicative voices within the central bank. Furthermore, the results suggest that stylistic variation—though often subtle—may convey unintended policy signals to markets, especially in contexts where linguistic shifts are closely scrutinized. This research contributes to the emerging intersection of natural language processing, monetary economics, and institutional transparency. It demonstrates the efficacy of stylometric techniques in revealing the hidden structure of policy discourse and suggests that linguistic analytics can offer valuable insights into the internal dynamics, credibility, and effectiveness of monetary authorities. These findings contribute to sustainable financial governance by demonstrating how AI-driven analysis can enhance institutional transparency, promote consistent policy communication, and support long-term economic stability—key pillars of sustainable development.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8979","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:52:46.413849","language":"en","tags":["environment","open-access","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":298,"author":"İbrahim Özkan","raw_content_length":2450,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.49,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Principal Component Analysis","the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey","Sustainable Central Bank Communications","HCPC","PCA","Hierarchical Clustering","CBRT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2390,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Stylometric Analysis","Sustainable Central Bank Communications","Revealing Authorial Signatures","Monetary Policy Statements","Sustainable economic development","transparent and consistent institutional communication","monetary authorities","long-term financial stability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Sustainable economic development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Stylometric Analysis":2.0,"Sustainable Central Bank Communications":2.0,"Revealing Authorial Signatures":2.0,"Monetary Policy Statements":2.0,"Sustainable economic development":1.0,"transparent and consistent institutional communication":1.0,"monetary authorities":1.0,"long-term financial stability":1.0}},"age_hours":12.975501003611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7902,"joy":0.0776,"surprise":0.0183,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0536,"anger":0.026,"disgust":0.0268},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study uses stylometric analysis to understand communication patterns within a central bank.
