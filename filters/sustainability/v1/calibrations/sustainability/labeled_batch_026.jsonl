{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2e8cab172f25","title":"Conjugate queries can help","content":"arXiv:2510.07622v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We give a natural problem over input quantum oracles $U$ which cannot be solved with exponentially many black-box queries to $U$ and $U^\\dagger$, but which can be solved with constant many queries to $U$ and $U^*$, or $U$ and $U^{\\mathrm{T}}$. We also demonstrate a quantum commitment scheme that is secure against adversaries that query only $U$ and $U^\\dagger$, but is insecure if the adversary can query $U^*$. These results show that conjugate and transpose queries do give more power to quantum algorithms, lending credence to the idea put forth by Zhandry that cryptographic primitives should prove security against these forms of queries. Our key lemma is that any circuit using $q$ forward and inverse queries to a state preparation unitary for a state $\\sigma$ can be simulated to $\\varepsilon$ error with $n = \\mathcal{O}(q^2/\\varepsilon)$ copies of $\\sigma$. Consequently, for decision tasks, algorithms using (forward and inverse) state preparation queries only ever perform quadratically better than sample access. These results follow from straightforward combinations of existing techniques; our contribution is to state their consequences in their strongest, most counter-intuitive form. In doing so, we identify a motif where generically strengthening a quantum resource can be possible if the output is allowed to be random, bypassing no-go theorems for deterministic algorithms. We call this the acorn trick.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07622","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.351331","language":"en","tags":["csds","computer-science","preprints","cscc","research","quant-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Ewin Tang, John Wright, Mark Zhandry","raw_content_length":1480,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["\\varepsilon$","Zhandry"],"locations":[],"monetary":["U^*$","$U$ and","only $U$ and $U^\\dagger$"]},"char_count":1477,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Conjugate queries","which","arXiv251007622v1 Announce Type","cross","a natural problem","input quantum","exponentially many black-box queries","constant many queries","UmathrmT","a quantum commitment scheme"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Conjugate queries":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251007622v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"a natural problem":1.0,"input quantum":1.0,"exponentially many black-box queries":1.0,"constant many queries":1.0,"UmathrmT":1.0,"a quantum commitment scheme":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7774009549999996,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3580000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2716,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9211,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.0188,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.0176,"anger":0.0179,"disgust":0.0089},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on quantum algorithms and their potential to solve problems more efficiently.

While Maximum Likelihood Estimation has traditionally served as the dominant training paradigm, recent work have highlighted its limitations, particularly in generalization and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting compared to Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as Policy Gradient methods. However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning.

The commonly used version repeatedly splits data, trains the prediction model on the training set, evaluates the model performance on the test set, and averages the model performance across different data splits. A well-known criticism is that such cross-validation procedure does not directly estimate the performance of the particular model recommended for future use. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the performance of a model trained on a specific (random) training set. A naive estimator can be obtained by applying the model to a disjoint testing set. Surprisingly, cross-validation estimators computed from other random splits can be used to improve this naive estimator within a random-effects model framework. We develop two estimators -- a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and an empirical Bayes estimator -- that perform similarly to or better than both the conventional cross-validation estimator and the naive single-split estimator. Simulations and a real-data example demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07649","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.352117","language":"en","tags":["statme","statml","statap","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Tianyu Pan, Vincent Z.

A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning.

Recent approaches using conformal prediction construct data-driven uncertainty sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees, but they still fix coverage targets a priori and offer little guidance for selecting robustness levels. We propose a new framework that provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage and regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method constructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto frontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate robustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is simple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization formulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing approaches.

Our goal is to certify that the estimate lies within a desired margin of error, using as few queries as possible. We propose a simple algorithm that adaptively selects questions to maximize Fisher information and updates the estimate using a method-of-moments approach, paired with a novel test statistic to decide when the estimate is accurate enough. We prove that this Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the best-arm identification literature. Our analysis overcomes a key technical challenge in the fixed-budget setting -- handling the dependence between the evolving estimate and the query distribution -- by exploiting a structural symmetry in the model and combining large deviation tools with Ville's inequality. Our results provide rigorous theoretical support for simple and efficient adaptive testing procedures.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07862","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.355757","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Sanghwa Kim (KAIST), Dohyun Ahn (The Chinese University of Hong Kong), Seungki Min (Seoul National University)","raw_content_length":1214,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Optimality of Tracking Fisher Information","Stochastic Binary Responses arXiv:2510.07862v1 Announce"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1213,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Optimality","Tracking Fisher Information","Adaptive Testing","Stochastic Binary Responses","questions","arXiv251007862v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","the problem","a continuous ability parameter"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Optimality":2.0,"Tracking Fisher Information":2.0,"Adaptive Testing":2.0,"Stochastic Binary Responses":2.0,"questions":2.0,"arXiv251007862v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"a continuous ability parameter":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7775647813888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8186,"joy":0.0976,"surprise":0.0261,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.0183,"anger":0.0259,"disgust":0.0051},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical algorithm for adaptive testing.

While asymptotically good qLDPC codes have been constructed on 2D HDX built from products of graphs, these constructions have a number of limitations, like lack of structure useful for fault-tolerant logic. We develop a framework for transversal logical gates that can naturally utilize symmetric non-product simplicial HDX, and we demonstrate a particular code in this framework that offers various advantages over prior constructions. Specifically, we study the generalization of color codes to \\emph{Tanner color codes}, which encompass color, pin, and rainbow codes, and should enable constructions with better parameters. We prove an `unfolding' theorem that characterizes the logical operators of the Tanner color code in terms of logical operators from several colored copies of the companion sheaf code. We leverage this understanding of the logical operators to identify a local condition that ensures such a code on a $D$-dimensional complex has a strictly-transversal $\\frac{2 \\pi}{2^D}$-phase gate on a single block, $\\frac{2 \\pi}{2^\\ell}$-phase gates on subsets of a single block for $\\ell<D$, and $C^{D-1}Z$ across $D$ blocks that preserve the code space. We explicitly instantiate our paradigm in every dimension with codes on highly-symmetric expanding coset complexes. These are the first qubit codes explicitly defined on expanding (non-product) simplicial complexes. We investigate in detail the self-dual 2D family, which has large rate $\\geq \\frac{7}{64}$ and transversal $CZ$, $S$, and $H$ gates, among many other fault-tolerant (generalizations of) fold-transversal gates arising from the symmetry of the complex. We conjecture that it has constant relative distance. We conclude by describing a Floquet variant of this code with check weight 4.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07864","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.356249","language":"en","tags":["mathit","computer-science","preprints","csit","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":284,"author":"Kyle Gulshen, Tali Kaufman","raw_content_length":1968,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.42,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HDX","Transversal Gates arXiv:2510.07864v1 Announce Type: cross","Quantum"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1967,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantum Tanner Color Codes","Qubits","Transversal Gates","arXiv251007864v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This work","our understanding","how high dimensional expanders","HDX"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantum Tanner Color Codes":2.0,"Qubits":2.0,"Transversal Gates":2.0,"arXiv251007864v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This work":1.0,"our understanding":1.0,"how high dimensional expanders":1.0,"HDX":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7775801297222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.953,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7906,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9339,"joy":0.0129,"surprise":0.031,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0044,"anger":0.0085,"disgust":0.0043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on quantum error correction codes.

Previous work has theoretically shown the suitability of the MoM estimator in certain contaminated settings. However, the (minimax) optimality of MoM and its limitations under adversarial contamination remain unknown beyond the Gaussian case. In this paper, we present upper and lower bounds for the error of MoM under adversarial contamination for multiple classes of distributions. In particular, we show that MoM is (minimax) optimal in the class of distributions with finite variance, as well as in the class of distributions with infinite variance and finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment. We also provide lower bounds for MoM's error that match the order of the presented upper bounds, and show that MoM is sub-optimal for light-tailed distributions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07867","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.356650","language":"en","tags":["statth","statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","mathst","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Xabier de Juan, Santiago Mazuelas","raw_content_length":1064,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MoM"],"persons":["MoM","Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1063,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Optimality","MoM","samples","arXiv251007867v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","The Median-of-Means","a robust estimator","machine learning","scenarios"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["machine learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Optimality":2.0,"MoM":2.0,"samples":2.0,"arXiv251007867v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The Median-of-Means":1.0,"a robust estimator":1.0,"machine learning":1.0,"scenarios":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7775956363888885,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.984,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7968,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1266,"joy":0.0039,"surprise":0.0044,"sadness":0.0675,"fear":0.0816,"anger":0.0392,"disgust":0.6768},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical bounds on the error of the Median-of-Means estimator under adversarial contamination.

However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53]. The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are then injected into future prompts, al- lowing the system to adjust indicator priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025 shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantita- tive agent delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%.

In this work, we propose a modular framework for constructing secure key leasing with a classical-lessor, where the lessor is entirely classical and, in particular, the quantum secret key can be both leased and revoked using only classical communication. Based on this framework, we obtain classical-lessor secure key leasing schemes for public-key encryption (PKE), pseudorandom function (PRF), and digital signature. We adopt the strong security notion known as security against verification key revealing attacks (VRA security) proposed by Kitagawa et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) into the classical-lessor setting, and we prove that all three of our schemes satisfy this notion under the learning with errors assumption. Our PKE scheme improves upon the previous construction by Goyal et al.

Although acute treatments have advanced, recovery remains challenging and limited. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a promising tool for post-stroke rehabilitation by promoting neuroplasticity. However, clinical outcomes remain variable, and optimal protocols have yet to be established. This study explores strategies to optimize BCI-based rehabilitation by comparing motor imagery of affected hand movement versus rest, instead of the conventional left-versus-right motor imagery. This alternative aims to simplify the task and address the weak contralateral activation commonly observed in stroke patients. Two datasets, one from healthy individuals and one from stroke patients, were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results showed improved performance using both FBCSP and EEGNet. Additionally, we investigated the impact of session duration and found that shorter training sessions produced better BCI performance than longer sessions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08082","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.361496","language":"en","tags":["q-bionc","research","cssy","computer-science","preprints","eesssp","eesssy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Aniana Cruz, Marko Kuzmanoski, Gabriel Pires","raw_content_length":1122,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BCI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1121,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Stroke","BCI Rehabilitation Protocols","Task Design","Training Duration","arXiv251008082v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","a leading cause","long-term disability","the second most common cause"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Training Duration"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Stroke":3.0,"BCI Rehabilitation Protocols":2.0,"Task Design":2.0,"Training Duration":2.0,"arXiv251008082v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a leading cause":1.0,"long-term disability":1.0,"the second most common cause":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7777726316666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.062000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6124,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8085,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0317,"sadness":0.0632,"fear":0.0715,"anger":0.0069,"disgust":0.0094},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on optimizing BCI rehabilitation protocols for stroke patients.

In this paper, we present a learning-theoretic framework to quantify the trade-off between synthetic and real data. Our approach leverages algorithmic stability to derive generalization error bounds, characterizing the optimal synthetic-to-real data ratio that minimizes expected test error as a function of the Wasserstein distance between the real and synthetic distributions. We motivate our framework in the setting of kernel ridge regression with mixed data, offering a detailed analysis that may be of independent interest. Our theory predicts the existence of an optimal ratio, leading to a U-shaped behavior of test error with respect to the proportion of synthetic data. Empirically, we validate this prediction on CIFAR-10 and a clinical brain MRI dataset. Our theory extends to the important scenario of domain adaptation, showing that carefully blending synthetic target data with limited source data can mitigate domain shift and enhance generalization.

Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity, clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by 4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%, while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity, privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05492","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.548965","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Zhuoyi Huang, Nutan Sahoo, Anamika Kumari, Girish Kumar, Kexuan Cai, Shixing Cao, Yue Kang, Tian Xia, Somya Chatterjee, Nicholas Hausman, Aidan Jay, Eric S.

In the Heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics, the deviation of the system variables from their initial values lends itself to closed-form computation in terms of tractable moment dynamics for open quantum harmonic oscillators and finite-level quantum systems governed by linear or quasi-linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations, respectively. This tractability is used in a recently proposed optimality criterion for varying the system parameters so as to maximise the memory decoherence time when the mean-square deviation achieves a given critical threshold. The memory decoherence time maximisation approach is extended beyond the previously considered low-threshold asymptotic approximation and to Schr\\\"{o}dinger type mean-square deviation functionals for the reduced system state governed by the Lindblad master equation. We link this approach with the minimisation of the mean-square deviation functionals at a finite time horizon and with their discounted version which quantifies the averaged performance of the quantum system as a temporary memory under a Poisson flow of storage requests.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08299","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.363439","language":"en","tags":["mathoc","research","cssy","computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","eesssy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Igor G.

However, it is often hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search.

Unfortunately, since models are usually trained solely based on samples from the original (unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased test-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when performative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the classic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate several performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in the label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels and the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which depends only on data from the original distribution and on the type performative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a classifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative risk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard binary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered performative scenarios. We also conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our performative risk minimization method and showcase benefits on synthetic and real data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08335","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.364222","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Ivan Kirev, Lyuben Baltadzhiev, Nikola Konstantinov","raw_content_length":1436,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PAC Learnability","the Presence of Performativity arXiv:2510.08335v1 Announce"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1435,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PAC Learnability","the Presence","Performativity","arXiv251008335v1 Announce Type","cross","the wide-spread adoption","machine learning models","real-world applications","the phenomenon","performativity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["machine learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PAC Learnability":2.0,"the Presence":2.0,"Performativity":2.0,"arXiv251008335v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"the wide-spread adoption":1.0,"machine learning models":1.0,"real-world applications":1.0,"the phenomenon":1.0,"performativity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7778679166666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.8709999999999996,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6804,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0221,"sadness":0.0406,"fear":0.189,"anger":0.0211,"disgust":0.041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for improving machine learning model performance in the presence of performativity, which could indirectly support sustainability efforts by improving the accuracy of models used in climate-related applications.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_bdc9b775cdb4","title":"Computing moment polytopes","content":"arXiv:2510.08336v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization. Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002). This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\\mathbb{C}^3\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^3\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\\mathbb{C}^4\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^4\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08336","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.364661","language":"en","tags":["mathrt","mathag","computer-science","cssc","preprints","cscc","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Maxim van den Berg, Matthias Christandl, Vladimir Lysikov, Harold Nieuwboer, Michael Walter, Jeroen Zuiddam","raw_content_length":1877,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["polytopes arXiv:2510.08336v1","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mat"]},"char_count":1872,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["quantum information","moment polytopes","arXiv251008336v1 Announce Type","cross","Tensors","mathematics","computer science","physics","Their study","algebraic geometry and representation theory"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["computer science","Their study"],"ai_ml":["algebraic geometry and representation theory"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"quantum information":2.0,"moment polytopes":2.0,"arXiv251008336v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Tensors":1.0,"mathematics":1.0,"computer science":1.0,"physics":1.0,"Their study":1.0,"algebraic geometry and representation theory":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7778819105555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8558,"joy":0.051,"surprise":0.0659,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors, enabling computation for tensors of significantly larger dimensions than previously possible.

Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method. Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08348","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.365538","language":"en","tags":["csds","computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"\\'Etienne Objois, Adrian Vladu","raw_content_length":1443,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Clarkson","Adaptive Sparsification for"],"persons":["Assadi"],"locations":["Grover"],"monetary":["\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n"]},"char_count":1440,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive Sparsification","Linear Programming","arXiv251008348v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","a generic framework","linear programs","LPs","many constraints","adaptive sparsification"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Linear Programming"],"ai_ml":["many constraints"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive Sparsification":2.0,"Linear Programming":2.0,"arXiv251008348v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a generic framework":1.0,"linear programs":1.0,"LPs":1.0,"many constraints":1.0,"adaptive sparsification":1.0}},"age_hours":2.777912203333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8925,"joy":0.0402,"surprise":0.0439,"sadness":0.0033,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.0127,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework for solving linear programs, potentially leading to faster solvers for mixed packing and covering problems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0f23a050dd62","title":"MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero","content":"arXiv:2510.08392v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_766cc2be9e74","title":"Optimal Stopping in Latent Diffusion Models","content":"arXiv:2510.08409v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We identify and analyze a surprising phenomenon of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) where the final steps of the diffusion can degrade sample quality. In contrast to conventional arguments that justify early stopping for numerical stability, this phenomenon is intrinsic to the dimensionality reduction in LDMs. We provide a principled explanation by analyzing the interaction between latent dimension and stopping time. Under a Gaussian framework with linear autoencoders, we characterize the conditions under which early stopping is needed to minimize the distance between generated and target distributions. More precisely, we show that lower-dimensional representations benefit from earlier termination, whereas higher-dimensional latent spaces require later stopping time.

Our approach is based on the NPA hierarchy applied to a polynomially-sized system of constraints defining the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2^{n})$, as well as additional constraints which put restrictions on the corresponding representations of the algebra. We also use as input an upper bound on the ground state energy, either using a hierarchy introduced by Fawzi, Fawzi, and Scalet, or an analog for qubit Hamiltonians of the Lasserre hierarchy of upper bounds introduced by Klep, Magron, Mass\\'{e}, and Vol\\v{c}i\\v{c}. The convergence of the certificates does not require that the Hamiltonian be frustration-free. We prove that the resulting certificates have polynomial size at fixed degree and converge asymptotically (in fact, at level $n$), by showing that all allowed representations of the algebra correspond to the second exterior power $\\wedge^2(\\mathbb{C}^{2^n})$, which encodes the sum of the two smallest eigenvalues of the original Hamiltonian.

Gidney showed that allowing Hadamard basis measurements during pebble games can dramatically improve costs -- an extension termed \"spooky pebble games\" because the measurements leave temporary phase errors called ghosts. In this work, we define and study parallel spooky pebble games. Previous work by Blocki, Holman, and Lee (TCC 2022) and Gidney studied the benefits offered by either parallelism or spookiness individually; here we show that these resources can yield impressive gains when used together. First, we show by construction that a line graph of length $\\ell$ can be pebbled in depth $2\\ell$ (which is exactly optimal) using space $\\leq 2.47\\log \\ell$. Then, to explore pebbling schemes using even less space, we use a highly optimized $A^*$ search implemented in Julia to find the lowest-depth parallel spooky pebbling possible for a range of concrete line graph lengths $\\ell$ given a constant number of pebbles $s$. We show that these techniques can be applied to Regev's factoring algorithm (Journal of the ACM 2025) to significantly reduce the cost of its arithmetic. For example, we find that 4096-bit integers $N$ can be factored in multiplication depth 193, which outperforms the 680 required of previous variants of Regev and the 444 reported by Eker{\\aa} and G\\\"artner for Shor's algorithm (IACR Communications in Cryptology 2025). While space-optimized implementations of Shor's algorithm remain likely the best candidates for first quantum factorization of large integers, our results show that Regev's algorithm may have practical importance in the future, especially given the possibility of further optimization. Finally, we believe our pebbling techniques will find applications in quantum cryptanalysis beyond integer factorization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08432","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.367618","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":290,"author":"Gregory D.

This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU.

Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem.

We validate the architecture through successful integration with Sandia's $\\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for multi-GPU HPC simulations.

The fastest known heuristic attacks on SVP are via so-called sieving methods. While these still take exponential time in the dimension $d$, they are significantly faster than non-heuristic approaches and their heuristic assumptions are verified by extensive experiments. $k$-Tuple sieving is an iterative method where each iteration takes as input a large number of lattice vectors of a certain norm, and produces an equal number of lattice vectors of slightly smaller norm, by taking sums and differences of $k$ of the input vectors. Iterating these ''sieving steps'' sufficiently many times produces a short lattice vector. The fastest attacks (both classical and quantum) are for $k=2$, but taking larger $k$ reduces the amount of memory required for the attack. In this paper we improve the quantum time complexity of 3-tuple sieving from $2^{0.3098 d}$ to $2^{0.2846 d}$, using a two-level amplitude amplification aided by a preprocessing step that associates the given lattice vectors with nearby ''center points'' to focus the search on the neighborhoods of these center points. Our algorithm uses $2^{0.1887d}$ classical bits and QCRAM bits, and $2^{o(d)}$ qubits.

Its natural extension to hypergraphs captures higher-order correlations beyond pairwise interactions. In this work, we develop a quantum algorithm for hypergraph community detection that achieves a quartic quantum speedup over the best known classical algorithm, along with superpolynomial savings in space. Our algorithm is based on the Kikuchi method, which we extend beyond previously considered problems such as Tensor PCA and $p$XORSAT to a broad family of generalized stochastic block models. To demonstrate (near) optimality of this method, we prove matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) in the low-degree framework, showing that the algorithm saturates a smooth statistical-computational tradeoff. The quantum speedup arises from a quantized version of the Kikuchi method and is based on the efficient preparation of a guiding state correlated with the underlying community structure. Our work suggests that prior quantum speedups using the Kikuchi method are sufficiently robust to encompass a broader set of problems than previously believed; we conjecture that a quantity known as marginal order characterizes the existence of these quantum speedups.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08494","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.372462","language":"en","tags":["csds","computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Alexander Schmidhuber, Alexander Zlokapa","raw_content_length":1287,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quartic"],"persons":[],"locations":["Kikuchi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1286,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quartic quantum speedups","community detection","arXiv251008494v1 Announce Type","cross","Community detection","a foundational problem","data science","Its natural extension","hypergraphs","higher-order correlations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["data science"],"research_academic":["data science"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quartic quantum speedups":2.0,"community detection":2.0,"arXiv251008494v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Community detection":1.0,"a foundational problem":1.0,"data science":1.0,"Its natural extension":1.0,"hypergraphs":1.0,"higher-order correlations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7781016369444442,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.062000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6124,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8575,"joy":0.0331,"surprise":0.0827,"sadness":0.0041,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0109,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a quantum algorithm for hypergraph community detection, achieving a quartic speedup over classical algorithms.

While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08499","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.373302","language":"en","tags":["csds","cond-matstr-el","computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Sitan Chen, Jordan Cotler, Hsin-Yuan Huang","raw_content_length":1747,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1746,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantum Probe Tomography","arXiv251008499v1 Announce Type","cross","many-body systems","a fundamental problem","physics","chemistry","materials science","significant progress","many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["materials science"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantum Probe Tomography":2.0,"arXiv251008499v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"many-body systems":1.0,"a fundamental problem":1.0,"physics":1.0,"chemistry":1.0,"materials science":1.0,"significant progress":1.0,"many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7781309755555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8352,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.043,"sadness":0.0101,"fear":0.0545,"anger":0.0386,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm for learning Hamiltonian parameters using quantum probe tomography.

In this work, we initiate the study of verification of classical shadows, denoted classical shadow validity (CSV), from the perspective of computational complexity, which asks: Given a classical shadow S, how hard is it to verify that S predicts the measurement statistics of a quantum state? We show that even for the elegantly simple classical shadow protocol of [Huang, Kueng, Preskill, Nature Physics 2020] utilizing local Clifford measurements, CSV is QMA-complete.

Among other results, we also show that CSV for exponentially many observables is complete for a quantum generalization of the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, yielding the first natural complete problem for such a class.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08515","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.374529","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscc","research","quant-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Georgios Karaiskos, Dorian Rudolph, Johannes Jakob Meyer, Jens Eisert, Sevag Gharibian","raw_content_length":1109,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CSV"],"persons":["Mao","Zhu","Kueng","Huang","Clifford"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1108,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a classical shadow","which","arXiv251008515v1 Announce Type","cross","Classical shadows","succinct classical representations","quantum states","one","a set","properties"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a classical shadow":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251008515v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Classical shadows":1.0,"succinct classical representations":1.0,"quantum states":1.0,"one":1.0,"a set":1.0,"properties":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7781763438888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8826,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0841,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0095,"anger":0.0081,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on the computational complexity of verifying classical shadows, a method for representing quantum states.

The challenge of having up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms existing graph diffusion models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08535","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.374921","language":"en","tags":["statml","mathpr","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Tassilo Schwarz, Cai Dieball, Constantin Kogler, Kevin Lam, Renaud Lambiotte, Arnaud Doucet, Alja\\v{z} Godec, George Deligiannidis","raw_content_length":1173,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Dyson Diffusion Model","Permutation arXiv:2510.08535v1 Announce Type: cross"],"persons":["Brownian Motion","Dyson"],"locations":[],"monetary":["up to $"]},"char_count":1172,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Permutation","arXiv251008535v1 Announce Type","cross","Diffusion models","modeling","adjacency matrix representations","The challenge","up to n","such representations","graphs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Permutation":2.0,"arXiv251008535v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Diffusion models":1.0,"modeling":1.0,"adjacency matrix representations":1.0,"The challenge":1.0,"up to n":1.0,"such representations":1.0,"graphs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7781902569444448,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.4065000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3187,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8852,"joy":0.0229,"surprise":0.0396,"sadness":0.0158,"fear":0.0112,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.008},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel graph diffusion model.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_018f71c6a593","title":"Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k","content":"arXiv:2510.08537v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08537","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.375328","language":"en","tags":["mathit","computer-science","preprints","csit","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Nicholas Laracuente","raw_content_length":1479,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1478,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Unstructured k","random circuits","arXiv251008537v1 Announce Type","cross","A major line","questions","quantum information","computing","locally random circuits","global randomness"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["computing"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Unstructured k":2.0,"random circuits":2.0,"arXiv251008537v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"A major line":1.0,"questions":1.0,"quantum information":1.0,"computing":1.0,"locally random circuits":1.0,"global randomness":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7782056613888892,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6173,"joy":0.0151,"surprise":0.1797,"sadness":0.0333,"fear":0.0789,"anger":0.02,"disgust":0.0557},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on quantum circuit architectures and their convergence to k-designs.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d8f7ab6836d7","title":"Computational and statistical lower bounds for low","content":"arXiv:2510.08541v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Recent work has generalized several results concerning the well-understood spiked Wigner matrix model of a low-rank signal matrix corrupted by additive i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm for detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal strength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved information-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions, match the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the computational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for a much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm cannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial algorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness conjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborov\\'a (2023). With similar techniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class of signal distributions not treated by prior work. Unlike all of the above results on inhomogeneous models, our results do not assume that the variance profile has a block structure, and suggest that the same spectral algorithm might remain optimal for quite general profiles. We include a numerical study of this claim for an example of a smoothly-varying rather than piecewise-constant profile. Our proofs involve analyzing the graph sums of a matrix, which also appear in free and traffic probability, but we require new bounds on these quantities that are tighter than existing ones for non-negative matrices, which may be of independent interest.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08541","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.375781","language":"en","tags":["csds","statth","mathpr","computer-science","cslg","preprints","mathst","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Debsurya De, Dmitriy Kunisky","raw_content_length":1833,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.345,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Wigner"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1832,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Computational and statistical lower bounds","arXiv251008541v1 Announce Type","cross","Recent work","several results","the well-understood spiked Wigner matrix model","a low-rank signal matrix","additive iid","Gaussian noise","the inhomogeneous case"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Computational and statistical lower bounds":2.0,"arXiv251008541v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Recent work":1.0,"several results":1.0,"the well-understood spiked Wigner matrix model":1.0,"a low-rank signal matrix":1.0,"additive iid":1.0,"Gaussian noise":1.0,"the inhomogeneous case":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778220873611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8611,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.049,"sadness":0.0108,"fear":0.0134,"anger":0.0206,"disgust":0.0342},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical improvements to algorithms for signal detection in noisy data.

For classical systems, we have a unified perspective which connects structural properties of systems at thermal equilibrium to the Markov chain dynamics that mix to them. We lack such a perspective for quantum systems: there is no framework to translate the quantitative convergence of the Markovian evolution into strong structural consequences. We develop a general framework that brings the breadth and flexibility of the classical theory to quantum Gibbs states at high temperature. At its core is a natural quantum analog of a Dobrushin condition; whenever this condition holds, a concise path-coupling argument proves rapid mixing for the corresponding Markovian evolution. The same machinery bridges dynamic and structural properties: rapid mixing yields exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI) without restrictions on the size of the probed subsystems, resolving a central question in the theory of open quantum systems. Our key technical insight is an optimal transport viewpoint which couples quantum dynamics to a linear differential equation, enabling precise control over how local deviations from equilibrium propagate to distant sites.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08542","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.376185","language":"en","tags":["csds","computer-science","preprints","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Ainesh Bakshi, Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra, Ewin Tang","raw_content_length":1369,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dobrushin"],"persons":["Markovian","Markov"],"locations":["Gibbs"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1366,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Dobrushin condition","quantum Markov chains","Rapid mixing","conditional mutual information","high temperature","equilibrium","Announce Type","A central challenge","quantum physics","the structural properties"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["quantum Markov chains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Dobrushin condition":2.0,"quantum Markov chains":2.0,"Rapid mixing":2.0,"conditional mutual information":2.0,"high temperature":2.0,"equilibrium":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"A central challenge":1.0,"quantum physics":1.0,"the structural properties":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778235858888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8078,"joy":0.026,"surprise":0.1286,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0117,"anger":0.0165,"disgust":0.0039},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical framework for understanding quantum systems and their dynamics.

Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12510","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.378614","language":"en","tags":["csmm","computer-science","cscv","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Xianke Chen, Daizong Liu, Xun Yang, Xirong Li, Jianfeng Dong, Meng Wang, Xun Wang","raw_content_length":1275,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Partially Relevant Video Retrieval","Multi-Scale Similarity Learn"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1274,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PRVR","Partially Relevant Video Retrieval","videos","arXiv220812510v2 Announce Type","Abstract","video","T2VR","a correspondence","the videos","ad-hoc textual queries"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PRVR":2.0,"Partially Relevant Video Retrieval":2.0,"videos":2.0,"arXiv220812510v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"video":1.0,"T2VR":1.0,"a correspondence":1.0,"the videos":1.0,"ad-hoc textual queries":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7783088936111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9096,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0519,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0024,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to video retrieval, but it's currently in the research phase.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2c25e2044241","title":"Stochastic Interpolants: A Unifying Framework for Flows and Diffusions","content":"arXiv:2303.08797v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two probability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent density function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models, stochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schr\\\"odinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.379048","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","computer-science","cslg","preprints","cond-matdis-nn","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Michael S.

Matching Cut (MC), respectively, Perfect Matching Cut (PMC), is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a matching cut, respectively, a perfect matching cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem (DPM) is to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Solving an open problem posed in [Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (ISAAC 2022, Algorithmica 2023)], we show that PMC is NP-complete in graphs without induced 14-vertex path $P_{14}$. Our reduction also works simultaneously for MC and DPM, improving the previous hardness results of MC on $P_{15}$-free graphs and of DPM on $P_{19}$-free graphs to $P_{14}$-free graphs for both problems. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result: within $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs (graphs without chordless cycles of length at least 9), it is hard to distinguish between those without matching cuts (respectively, perfect matching cuts, disconnected perfect matchings) and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut. Moreover, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, none of these problems can be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time for $n$-vertex $P_{14}$-free 8-chordal graphs. On the positive side, we show that, as for MC [Moshi (JGT 1989)], DPM and PMC are polynomially solvable when restricted to 4-chordal graphs. Together with the negative results, this partly answers an open question on the complexity of PMC in $k$-chordal graphs asked in [Le, Telle (WG 2021, TCS 2022) & Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (MFCS 2023, TCS 2024)].","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05402","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.379882","language":"en","tags":["mathco","computer-science","preprints","csdm","cscc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Hoang-Oanh Le, Van Bang Le","raw_content_length":1648,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PMC","DPM","Perfect Matching Cut","Lucke, Paulusma, Ries"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$P_{14}$-free 8"]},"char_count":1645,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Complexity","algorithms","cut problems","graphs","long induced paths","cycles","a graph","a perfect matching cut","a perfect matching","a matching cut"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Complexity":2.0,"algorithms":2.0,"cut problems":2.0,"graphs":2.0,"long induced paths":2.0,"cycles":2.0,"a graph":2.0,"a perfect matching cut":2.0,"a perfect matching":2.0,"a matching cut":2.0}},"age_hours":2.7783555158333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2405,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8481,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8367,"joy":0.0117,"surprise":0.0169,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0297,"anger":0.0404,"disgust":0.0581},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on the computational complexity of graph problems related to matching cuts.

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based path embedding framework (GNN-PE), which allows efficient exact subgraph matching without introducing false dismissals. Unlike traditional GNN-based graph embeddings that only produce approximate subgraph matching results, in this paper, we carefully devise GNN-based embeddings for paths, such that: if two paths (and 1-hop neighbors of vertices on them) have the subgraph relationship, their corresponding GNN-based embedding vectors will strictly follow the dominance relationship. With such a newly designed property of path dominance embeddings, we are able to propose effective pruning strategies based on path label/dominance embeddings and guarantee no false dismissals for subgraph matching. We build multidimensional indexes over path embedding vectors, and develop an efficient subgraph matching algorithm by traversing indexes over graph partitions in parallel and applying our pruning methods. We also propose a cost-model-based query plan that obtains query paths from the query graph with low query cost. To further optimize our GNN-PE approach, we also propose a more efficient GNN-based path group embedding (GNN-PGE) technique, which performs subgraph matching over grouped path embedding vectors. We design effective pruning strategies (w.r.t. grouped path embeddings) that can significantly reduce the search space during the index traversal. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GNN-PE and GNN-PGE approaches for exact subgraph matching on both real and synthetic graph data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15641","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.381583","language":"en","tags":["csdb","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":265,"author":"Yutong Ye, Xiang Lian, Mingsong Chen","raw_content_length":1899,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.325,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GNN","GNN-PE"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1898,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["GNN","which","arXiv230915641v4 Announce Type","Abstract","The classic problem","exact subgraph matching","those subgraphs","a large-scale data graph","a given query graph","increasing importance"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"GNN":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv230915641v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The classic problem":1.0,"exact subgraph matching":1.0,"those subgraphs":1.0,"a large-scale data graph":1.0,"a given query graph":1.0,"increasing importance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778412004722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.3125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8625,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8873,"joy":0.0298,"surprise":0.0647,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.0081,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel GNN-based framework for efficient subgraph matching.

For example, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning can be viewed as learning representations to predict which states are likely to be visited in the future. While prior methods have used contrastive predictive coding to model time series data, learning representations that encode long-term dependencies usually requires large amounts of data. In this paper, we introduce a temporal difference version of contrastive predictive coding that stitches together pieces of different time series data to decrease the amount of data required to learn predictions of future events. We apply this representation learning method to derive an off-policy algorithm for goal-conditioned RL. Experiments demonstrate that, compared with prior RL methods, ours achieves $2 \\times$ median improvement in success rates and can better cope with stochastic environments. In tabular settings, we show that our method is about $20 \\times$ more sample efficient than the successor representation and $1500 \\times$ more sample efficient than the standard (Monte Carlo) version of contrastive predictive coding.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20141","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.382544","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Chongyi Zheng, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Benjamin Eysenbach","raw_content_length":1231,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Contrastive Difference Predictive Coding"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1230,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Contrastive Difference Predictive Coding","representations","arXiv231020141v3 Announce Type","Abstract","the future lie","the heart","many time-series questions","example","goal-conditioned reinforcement learning","which states"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["goal-conditioned reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Contrastive Difference Predictive Coding":2.0,"representations":2.0,"arXiv231020141v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the future lie":1.0,"the heart":1.0,"many time-series questions":1.0,"example":1.0,"goal-conditioned reinforcement learning":1.0,"which states":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7784413330555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9367,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0282,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0097,"anger":0.0082,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new representation learning method for goal-conditioned RL, showing improved sample efficiency compared to prior methods.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_5a116d0bbc4f","title":"I&S","content":"arXiv:2311.10126v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs (training & inference) undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&S-ViT' superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&S-ViT elevates the performance of 3-bit ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10126","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.383466","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Yunshan Zhong, Jiawei Hu, Mingbao lin, Mengzhao Chen, Rongrong Ji","raw_content_length":1473,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ViTs","I&S","PTQ"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1452,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ViTs","arXiv231110126v3 Announce Type","Abstract","the scalable performance","vision transformers","the dense computational costs","training","inference","their position","industrial applications"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["vision transformers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ViTs":3.0,"arXiv231110126v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the scalable performance":1.0,"vision transformers":1.0,"the dense computational costs":1.0,"training":1.0,"inference":1.0,"their position":1.0,"industrial applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7784716283333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.549,"joy":0.041,"surprise":0.0429,"sadness":0.1581,"fear":0.025,"anger":0.0455,"disgust":0.1384},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (I&S-ViT) to improve the efficiency of vision transformers, potentially reducing the computational cost and energy consumption associated with AI models.
