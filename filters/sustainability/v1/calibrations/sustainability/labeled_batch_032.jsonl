{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_049ce92af7ca","title":"A three","content":"arXiv:2510.07633v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) are widely used across physics, microscopy, neuroscience, and laser engineering, providing fast, precise, and non-mechanical control of light. While conventional AODs naturally support multiplexing in one and two dimensions, no analogous device has existed for three-dimensional control, leaving a critical gap in rapid focus tuning and 3D beam shaping. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional AOD system capable of multiplexed axial and lateral beam control with high speed and large dynamic range. We achieve this by combining a double-pass AOD with a diffraction grating in the Littrow configuration to realize a compact frequency-tunable lens with multiplexing capability. Our device enables axial scanning over more than twenty Rayleigh ranges with switching rates up to 100 kHz, while simultaneous multi-tone driving produces arbitrary multi-focal beam profiles. By integrating the axial module with lateral deflection, we generate reconfigurable 3D optical patterns. This approach establishes a broadly applicable platform for multiplexed 3D beam control, with potential applications from high-resolution microscopy and laser processing to scalable neutral-atom quantum technologies.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07633","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.040685","language":"en","tags":["physicsapp-ph","physicsatom-ph","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Lewis R.

The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07683","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.041106","language":"en","tags":["cond-matsoft","physicscomp-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Zicheng Yan (Brown University), Jialiang Tao (University of Wisconsin-Madison), Christian Franck (University of Wisconsin-Madison), David L.

One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07690","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.041938","language":"en","tags":["physicsapp-ph","physics","physicsins-det","cond-matsupr-con","preprints","quant-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Robinjeet Singh, Avirup Roy, Daniel Becker, Johnathan D.

At the same time, the thermal challenges arising from its stacked architecture have drawn considerable attention. Most existing studies on HBM thermal management are based on Fourier's law, neglecting the non-Fourier effects introduced by the micro/nanoscale structures within HBM. In this study, the Monte Carlo method (MC) is employed to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and investigate the impact of non-Fourier heat transport on the thermal behavior of HBM structures. The results reveal that non-Fourier heat transport leads to a junction temperature that is 59.8 K higher than that predicted by Fourier's law. Furthermore, it is found that the phonon transmittance at the chip interlayers has a severe impact on heat dissipation, with the temperature variation reaching up to 56.6 K.

Nevertheless, the synergistic integration of twist engineering and magneto-optical effects in bi-layer architectures remains unexplored. This work introduces twisted magnetic bi-layer photonic crystal slabs as a novel platform to unify these degrees of freedom. By continuously tuning the twist angle between two magneto-active photonic layers, the giant circular dichroism is observed, and the transmitted waves can be perfectly linearly polarized and rotated. These effects arise from the interplay between resonant properties of the Moir\\'e cell and magnetization-dependent coupling of circularly polarized states.

The adequate grid resolution is determined in the inertia-dominated regime with the aid of high-fidelity simulations of stationary two-phase homogeneous isotropic turbulence by evaluating convergence of total interfacial area, size distribution, SMD, and curvature distribution. Although standards for DNS for single-phase turbulence flow exist, there is a lack of similar guidance in two-phase flows. Therefore, length scale ratios of the Kolmogorov-Hinze to the Kolmogorov scale of \\eta_{KH}/\\eta \\sim We_{L}^{-3/5}Re_{L}^{3/4} in the inertia-dominated regime and the Kolmogorov-viscous to Kolmogorov scale of \\eta_{KV}/\\eta \\sim Ca_{L}^{-1}Re_{L}^{3/4} for the viscous-dominated regime, are constructed. These scalings imply a computational cost increase like We_{L}^{12/5} and Ca_{L}^4, in the inertia-dominated and viscous-dominated regimes, respectively. A novel dimensionless number, coined as the ratio of interface scales (Ris), is proposed to aid in the classification of the turbulence regimes in the presence of an interface. Convergence of the total interfacial area, size distribution, SMD, and curvature distribution are observed for grid resolutions of k_{\\max} \\eta_{KH} \\geq 60$ for second-order schemes. Furthermore, it is observed that this lower bound is the minimum required to capture intermittent events responsible for the increase of instantaneous total interfacial area. This criterion will be a valuable tool for determining grid resolution and time-step requirements a-priori for DNS of two-phase flows and for estimating the corresponding computational cost. This work provides guidelines and best practices for numerical simulations of two-phase flows, which will accelerate physics discovery and model development.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07727","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.043174","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicscomp-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":265,"author":"Luis H.

Here we demonstrate, through comprehensive finite element and variational Monte-Carlo modelling, that a reconfigurable three-dimensional array of needle shaped beams can selectively switch the quantum optical response of individual InAs nanorods embedded in GaAs. By tuning the local non resonant intensity pattern the exciton and biexciton energies were calculated, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) windows were examined, and correspondingly near-field diffraction carpets were dynamically reshaped. A single parameter the activation ratio between illuminated and dark nanorods provides continuous control over photoluminescence peak position (80 meV) and EIT bandwidth (six times).

In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_d788153c1cdb","title":"Effect of Stokes number on erosion on Pelton buckets for sediment","content":"arXiv:2510.08036v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With increased glacial melting and the need to maintain sediment continuity for ecosystem health, sediment-laden flows through hydropower plants are becoming increasingly problematic, particularly due to erosion on runner blades and buckets. A widely used mitigation strategy is the use of filters to protect Pelton turbines. However, these filters lead to rapid sediment accumulation in reservoirs, which must be drained frequently to maintain storage capacity. The high cost of such drainage operations calls for longer intervals between them, without compromising runner integrity, as erosion-induced stress concentrations may cause bucket rupture. A better understanding of the causes of runner erosion under varying operational and sediment conditions is essential to allow more sediment to pass through the hydraulic machine safely. This study investigates how sediment-laden flow through the nozzle affects particle distribution in the jet for different Stokes numbers. Furthermore, it analyses how a realistic particle size and spatial distribution in the impacting jet compares to the assumption of a uniform particle distribution with particles of mean size when simulating bucket erosion in Pelton wheels. The results show that the particle distribution in the jet follows a similar axisymmetric shape for low Stokes numbers whereas at higher Stokes numbers it becomes asymmetric. Additionally, it is shown that imposing uniform particle distribution with particles of mean diameter under-predicts tip- and splitter erosion when simulating the erosion on the bucket but is captured by imposing the realistic size and spatial distribution.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08036","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.047609","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicsflu-dyn","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Aron Dagur Beck, Elena Vagnoni","raw_content_length":1698,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Pelton"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1697,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["erosion","Effect","Stokes number","Pelton buckets","sediment","arXiv251008036v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","increased glacial melting","the need","sediment continuity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"erosion":3.0,"Effect":2.0,"Stokes number":2.0,"Pelton buckets":2.0,"sediment":2.0,"arXiv251008036v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"increased glacial melting":1.0,"the need":1.0,"sediment continuity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7866017530555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5425,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0257,"sadness":0.075,"fear":0.1135,"anger":0.1069,"disgust":0.1299},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the erosion of Pelton turbine buckets due to sediment-laden flows, aiming to optimize turbine operation and reduce the need for frequent reservoir drainage.

However, conventional designs based on directional coupling or multi-mode interference often suffer from back scattering, frequency-dependent splitting ratios, and limited bandwidth. To overcome these limitations, here, we propose a new physical mechanism to achieve a broadband, robust, and tunable beam splitter by manipulating the mode coupling of the topological unidirectional surface magnetoplasmons (USMP) at the input and output waveguides. We show that the beam splitter not only exhibits strong robustness against obstacles but also achieves a broad bandwidth across nearly the entire USMP band with arbitrarily tunable and frequency- independent splitting ratios. Moreover, the operating band of the beam splitter can be actively tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field, while its robust and broadband characteristics are retained.

This study investigates the optical Kerr effect (OKE) enhancement in high-refractive-index metasurfaces featuring non-BIC trapped-mode resonances, using gallium phosphide (GaP) as a model material. Three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations reveal a significant enhancement of the effective second-order refractive index, reaching values up to 700 times greater than bulk GaP. The numerical results show strong electromagnetic field localization at the trapped-mode resonance, characterized by a wide transmittance dip (low Q-factor) and near-unity reflectance. Remarkable stability is observed, with the OKE enhancement maintaining less than 5\\% variation for moderate polarization angles and tolerating random nanohole rotations that model fabrication imperfections. Compared to bound states in the continuum (BIC), the non-BIC trapped mode demonstrates superior robustness to structural disorder while achieving comparable nonlinear enhancement. These findings suggest promising applications in reflective nonlinear optics, particularly for high harmonic generation and polarization-insensitive photonic devices.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08100","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.049594","language":"en","tags":["physicsapp-ph","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Andrey V.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_e1fc918de6be","title":"Beyond the Training Data: Confidence","content":"arXiv:2510.08107v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Persistent systematic errors in Earth system models (ESMs) arise from difficulties in representing the full diversity of subgrid, multiscale atmospheric convection and turbulence. Machine learning (ML) parameterizations trained on short high-resolution simulations show strong potential to reduce these errors. However, stable long-term atmospheric simulations with hybrid (physics + ML) ESMs remain difficult, as neural networks (NNs) trained offline often destabilize online runs. Training convection parameterizations directly on coarse-grained data is challenging, notably because scales cannot be cleanly separated. This issue is mitigated using data from superparameterized simulations, which provide clearer scale separation. Yet, transferring a parameterization from one ESM to another remains difficult due to distribution shifts that induce large inference errors. Here, we present a proof-of-concept where a ClimSim-trained, physics-informed NN convection parameterization is successfully transferred to ICON-A. The scheme is (a) trained on adjusted ClimSim data with subtracted radiative tendencies, and (b) integrated into ICON-A. The NN parameterization predicts its own error, enabling mixing with a conventional convection scheme when confidence is low, thus making the hybrid AI-physics model tunable with respect to observations and reanalysis through mixing parameters. This improves process understanding by constraining convective tendencies across column water vapor, lower-tropospheric stability, and geographical conditions, yielding interpretable regime behavior. In AMIP-style setups, several hybrid configurations outperform the default convection scheme (e.g., improved precipitation statistics). With additive input noise during training, both hybrid and pure-ML schemes lead to stable simulations and remain physically consistent for at least 20 years.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08107","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.050015","language":"en","tags":["physics","physicsao-ph","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Helge Heuer, Tom Beucler, Mierk Schwabe, Julien Savre, Manuel Schlund, Veronika Eyring","raw_content_length":1931,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Training Data: Confidence arXiv:2510.08107v1 Announce Type","ESM"],"persons":["multiscale atmospheric convection"],"locations":["Earth"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1930,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Training Data","arXiv251008107v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Persistent systematic errors","Earth system models","ESMs","difficulties","the full diversity","subgrid","multiscale atmospheric convection"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the Training Data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Training Data":2.0,"arXiv251008107v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Persistent systematic errors":1.0,"Earth system models":1.0,"ESMs":1.0,"difficulties":1.0,"the full diversity":1.0,"subgrid":1.0,"multiscale atmospheric convection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7866931605555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8799,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0143,"fear":0.0518,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.012},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a proof-of-concept for transferring a machine learning-based convection parameterization between Earth system models, showing improved precipitation statistics in AMIP-style setups.

However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08136","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.050429","language":"en","tags":["physicsapp-ph","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Yiyi Yao, Shijie Kang, Aoning Luo, Jiusi Yu, Ken Qin, Xiexuan Zhang, Jiayu Fan, Xusheng Xia, Haitao Li, Xiaoxiao Wu","raw_content_length":1560,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Kirigami","kirigami"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1559,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Kirigami","arXiv251008136v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Chiral responses","electromagnetic metasurfaces","asymmetric interactions","the structure","incident waves","the unit cell","most existing metasurface designs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Kirigami":2.0,"arXiv251008136v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Chiral responses":1.0,"electromagnetic metasurfaces":1.0,"asymmetric interactions":1.0,"the structure":1.0,"incident waves":1.0,"the unit cell":1.0,"most existing metasurface designs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7867069147222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8605,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.0806,"sadness":0.0163,"fear":0.0117,"anger":0.0104,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel kirigami-based metasurface design with potential for dynamic modulation of chirality, which could lead to adaptive photonic systems.

While experimental and theoret- ical studies have previously been carried out for fluorine substitution, this is the first study of chlorine substitution. Five well-characterized base molecules are studied and the trends are compared with the effect of fluorine substitution. The trichloromethyl substitution is found to accelerate the rotation more than a trifluoromethyl (CF3) sub- stitution by reducing the life-time of the metastable state, due to larger steric hindrance in the metastable state than in the transition state for the thermal helix inversion (THI). A larger increase in the separation of the absorption peaks of the two isomers is also ob- tained. The Cl atom substitution, however, changes the energy landscape significantly, making the M isomer lower in energy than the P isomer, and raising the energy barrier for THI beyond that of the back transition, thus quenching the rotation.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08165","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.050824","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicschem-ph","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Ivan Tambovtsev, \\'Oskar Kristinsson, Hannes J\\'onsson","raw_content_length":1269,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Effect of Chlorine Substitution on Rotational Speed and Light Absorption of","the stereogenic center"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1268,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Effect","Chlorine Substitution","Rotational Speed","Light Absorption","Second Generation Molecular Motors","arXiv251008165v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The effect","a hydrogen atom","a chlorine atom"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["a hydrogen atom"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Effect":2.0,"Chlorine Substitution":2.0,"Rotational Speed":2.0,"Light Absorption":2.0,"Second Generation Molecular Motors":2.0,"arXiv251008165v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The effect":1.0,"a hydrogen atom":1.0,"a chlorine atom":1.0}},"age_hours":2.786722153888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7552,"joy":0.0226,"surprise":0.0463,"sadness":0.0115,"fear":0.0644,"anger":0.0518,"disgust":0.0481},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a theoretical study analyzing the effect of chlorine substitution on molecular motors.

It treats a rotor as an infinitesimally-thin permeable disk and applies the governing flow equations over a streamtube encompassing the disk. A well-known limitation of the theory is its assumption of ideal flow downstream of the disk, which restricts its applicability to short downwind distances before turbulence and mixing processes governing the wake evolution take hold. As a result, the classical theory also leads to unphysical predictions for highly-loaded rotors. Turbulent axisymmetric wakes, by contrast, represent an extensively-studied canonical free shear flow with much of the progress and its applications to wind turbines limited to the far-wake dynamics. In this work, we introduce a generalised actuator disk theory based on a hybrid stream-tube and wake control volume, that seamlessly integrates classical actuator disk analysis with wake turbulence modelling at arbitrary distances from the rotor. The resulting model, while still idealised, can be used to predict variations in velocity, pressure, and cross-sectional flow area as function of position, both upstream and downstream of the rotor disk. Furthermore, by accounting for turbulent entrainment in the wake development, it provides more realistic predictions of thrust and power coefficients for highly-loaded disks.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08213","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.052745","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicsflu-dyn","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Majid Bastankhah, Peter E.

With longer and more frequent disruptions as well as increasing ridership, traffic delays can incur substantial costs for passengers and other transport stakeholders, e.g., operators and infrastructure managers. Such costs can, however, be reduced thanks to effective travel information strategies during traffic disruptions. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation model to assess the value of travel information under different scenarios. Focusing on real-time travel information to train passengers, accessibility benefits are quantified in monetary terms based on historical delay distributions, timing of travel information (pre/on-trip) and ridership. Using a case study from the Swedish railways, the model is showcased and applied to a commuter line in Stockholm. The experimental results indicate individual valuations that are higher than references and savings at the system level of at least 23% of the delay costs.

However, the development of optimal interconnecting layers (ICLs) remains one major challenge for further efficiency gains, and progress in understanding the improved long-term stability of P-O tandem configuration has been lagging. In this study, we experimentally investigate the enhanced stability of p-i-n P-O TSCs employing a simplified C60/atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) SnOx/PEDOT: PSS ICL without an additional charge recombination layer (CRL), which achieve an averaged efficiency of 25.12% and a hero efficiency of 25.5%. Our finding discovers that the recrystallization of C60, a widely used electron transport layer in perovskite photovoltaics, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during operation, which act as migration channels for the interdiffusion of halide and Ag ions. Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that the tandem device architecture, incorporating organic semiconductor layers, effectively suppresses the bi-directional ion diffusion and mitigates electrode corrosion. Thus, the P-O TSC establishes a mutual protection system: the organic layers stabilize the perovskite sub-cell by suppressing ion diffusion-induced degradation, and the perovskite layer shields the organic sub-cell from spectrally induced degradation. The simultaneous synergistic protection mechanism enables P-O TSCs to achieve exceptional long-term operational stability, retaining over 91% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of continuous metal-halide lamp illumination, and to exhibit minimal fatigue after 86 cycles (2067 hours) of long-term diurnal (12/12-hour) testing. These results demonstrate that tandem cells significantly outperform their single-junction counterparts in both efficiency and stability.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08330","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.054778","language":"en","tags":["physics","physicsapp-ph","research","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Chao Liu, Kaicheng Zhang, Xin Zhou, Mingjian Wu, Paul Weitz, Shudi Qiu, Andrej Vincze, Yuchen Bai, Michael A.

Currently a popular hourly data-driven prediction scheme is multi-time-scale long short-term memory (MTS-LSTM), yet such models face challenges in probabilistic forecasts or integrating observations when available. Diffusion artificial intelligence (AI) models represent a promising method to predict high-resolution information, e.g., hourly streamflow. Here we develop a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (h-Diffusion) for hourly streamflow prediction that conditions on either observed or simulated daily discharge from hydrologic models to generate hourly hydrographs. The model is benchmarked on the CAMELS hourly dataset against record-holding MTS-LSTM and multi-frequency LSTM (MF-LSTM) baselines.

With the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) crossing the boundary between the sub- and super-Alfv\\'enic flow, Bandyopadhyay et al.

In this study, we re-examine the turbulence properties such as turbulence amplitude, anisotropy of the magnetic field variance, intermittency and switchback strength extending with PSP data for encounters 8-19. The later orbits probe lower altitudes and experience sub-Alfv\\'enic conditions more frequently providing a greater statistical coverage to contrast sub- and super-Alfv\\'enic solar wind. Also, by isolating the intervals where the solar wind speed is approximately equal to the Alfv\\'en speed, we explore the transition in more detail. We show that the amplitude of the normalized magnetic field fluctuation is smaller for the sub-Alfv\\'enic samples. While solar wind turbulence in general is shown to be anisotropic, the sub-Alfv\\'enic samples are more anisotropic than the super-Alfv\\'enic samples, in general. Further, we show that the sub- and super-Alfv\\'enic samples do not show much distinction in terms of intermittency strength.

We present a broadly applicable fluorescence-encoding method that circumvents coherence-time constraints by transducing time-varying magnetic fields directly into modulated fluorescence signals. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond as a model system, we demonstrate shot-noise-limited sensitivity for AC magnetic fields spanning near-DC to MHz frequencies, with detection bandwidth tunable via optical excitation power. The technique captures complete spectral information in a single measurement, eliminating the need for point-by-point frequency scanning, and allows phase-sensitive multi-frequency detection with Hz-level resolution. This approach transforms quantum sensors into atomic-scale spectrum analyzers, with immediate applications for low-frequency RF communication, zero-field NMR, and bioelectronic sensing.

The dynamics of magnetic particles in high-gradient magnetic fields-encompassing both their transport and eventual capture-arise from the coupled interplay of field-driven drift, fluid advection, and particle-field feedback. These processes remain poorly captured by existing models relying on empirical closures or discrete particle tracking. Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for collective magnetic particle transport and capture in high-gradient fields. The framework derives from a free-energy functional that couples magnetic energy, entropic mixing, and steric interactions, yielding a concentration-dependent susceptibility via homogenization theory. The resulting equations unify magnetism, mass transport, and momentum balances without ad hoc shut-off criteria, allowing field shielding, anisotropic deposition, and boundary-layer confinement to emerge naturally. Simulations predict canonical capture morphologies-axially aligned plumes, crescent-shaped deposits, and nonlinear shielding-across field strengths and flow regimes, consistent with trends reported in prior experimental and modeling studies. By organizing captured particle mass data into a dimensionless phase diagram based on the Mason number, we reveal three distinct regimes-thermodynamically controlled, transitional, and dynamically controlled. This perspective provides a predictive platform for in silico optimization and extension to three-dimensional geometries, and informing digital twin development for industrial-scale high-gradient magnetic separation processes.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07552","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.060892","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","cond-matstat-mech","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Marko Tesanovic, Daniel M.

Exploring the Protein Data Bank, we have identified nine different types of anomalous shells structurally close to flat octagonal quasicrystals. As we show, these numerous shells have cubic nets cut from short-period approximants of an octagonal tiling composed of square and rhombic tiles. The approximants and parent tiling are easily obtained within the Landau density wave approach, while the nonequilibrium assembly of them can be simulated using the pair potentials derived from critical density waves. Gluing a polyhedron net and mapping it onto a spherical surface induces tile distortions, and to reduce them, we introduce and minimize the effective elastic energy of the system. Thus, we return quasi-equivalence to previously equivalent tiles. Possible cubic faceting of the octagonal spherical tilings is discussed in terms of the topological charge distribution over the tiling vertices. The proposed structural models describe numerous proteinaceous shells including about half of the known symmetrical enzymes. Our results constitute a fundamental basis for further applications of identified octagonal assemblies and can help to discover and study similar systems in the future.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07555","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.061305","language":"en","tags":["cond-matsoft","physics","preprints","physicsbio-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Sergei B.

Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits.

Despite theoretical predictions of several phases of two-dimensional (2D) ice confined between idealized hydrophobic walls, experimental validation has been limited to the square phase, whose structural origin remains controversial. Here, we propose a realistic nanoconfinement setup using wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer and Cu(111) as the substrate.

However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07771","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.063592","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physicscomp-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Long Zhang, Guoying Gao","raw_content_length":1543,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CrSb"],"persons":["MnP"],"locations":["NiAs","MnP"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1542,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dimension","Announce Type","Altermagnets","significant interest","their vanishing net magnetic moment","non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting","altermagnetic AM multiferroics","especially triferroics","a model system","the effects"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dimension":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Altermagnets":1.0,"significant interest":1.0,"their vanishing net magnetic moment":1.0,"non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting":1.0,"altermagnetic AM multiferroics":1.0,"especially triferroics":1.0,"a model system":1.0,"the effects":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7871672583333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8492,"joy":0.0296,"surprise":0.0953,"sadness":0.0117,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0066,"disgust":0.0026},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the potential of altermagnetic multiferroics for spintronic applications.

Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport equation, we demonstrate that selective excitation of specific phonon modes enables active control over thermal transport. At an excitation multiplier of 25, the thermal conductivity of BAs can be enhanced by up to 2% or suppressed by up to 35% relative to its intrinsic value of 2235 W m^-1 K^-1. At a lower multiplier of 5, thermal conductivity can be increased by 2% or decreased by 11%. The modulation effect depends on excitation frequency, multiplier, and intrinsic phonon properties, with certain frequencies exhibiting opposite trends under different excitation intensities. Mechanistic analysis shows that at low excitation levels, phonon splitting suppresses Umklapp scattering, reducing the scattering rate, while at high levels, it enhances Normal scattering, increasing the scattering rate. This approach offers a dynamic and reversible route to tuning thermal conductivity, with applications in thermal management and thermoelectric energy conversion.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07934","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.065217","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physicscomp-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":178,"author":"Tianhao Li, Yangjun Qin, Dongkai Pan, Han Meng, Nuo Yang","raw_content_length":1304,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Boltzmann"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1303,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["thermal conductivity","bulk BAs","targeted phonon excitation","arXiv251007934v1","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This study","a reversible phonon excitation strategy","the thermal conductivity"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"thermal conductivity":2.0,"bulk BAs":2.0,"targeted phonon excitation":2.0,"arXiv251007934v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"a reversible phonon excitation strategy":1.0,"the thermal conductivity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7872264777777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.559,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9118,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.854,"joy":0.0305,"surprise":0.0515,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.0088,"anger":0.0326,"disgust":0.0169},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study presents a theoretical method for modulating thermal conductivity in boron arsenide.

Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08063","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.067695","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","cond-matmes-hall","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"\\'Alvaro Buend\\'ia, Jos\\'e Luis Pura, Vincenzo Giannini, Jos\\'e Antonio S\\'anchez Gil","raw_content_length":1136,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["2D Su arXiv:2510.08063v1 Announce Type: cross","SSH","2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ("],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1135,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["bulk","edge","Far-field radiation","corner eigenmodes","a finite 2D Su","arXiv251008063v1 Announce Type","cross","Subwavelength arrays","plasmonic nanoparticles","the behaviour"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["edge"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"bulk":3.0,"edge":3.0,"Far-field radiation":2.0,"corner eigenmodes":2.0,"a finite 2D Su":2.0,"arXiv251008063v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Subwavelength arrays":1.0,"plasmonic nanoparticles":1.0,"the behaviour":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7872962725,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8833,"joy":0.0265,"surprise":0.0606,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0147,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on controlling light at the nanoscale using plasmonic nanoparticles.

This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08493","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.073507","language":"en","tags":["statth","physicsatom-ph","math-ph","cond-matstat-mech","physics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","mathst","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Sujay Kazi, Iman Marvian","raw_content_length":1362,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks arXiv:2510.08493v1 Announce Type:","fidelity"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1361,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimal Distillation","Qubit Clocks","arXiv251008493v1 Announce Type","cross","coherence distillation","time-translation-invariant operations","many copies","a quantum state","coherence","the energy eigenbasis"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimal Distillation":2.0,"Qubit Clocks":2.0,"arXiv251008493v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"coherence distillation":1.0,"time-translation-invariant operations":1.0,"many copies":1.0,"a quantum state":1.0,"coherence":1.0,"the energy eigenbasis":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787468921666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8097,"joy":0.0931,"surprise":0.0715,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0033,"anger":0.0107,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on optimizing coherence distillation for qubit clocks, aiming to produce purer coherent states.

We propose an association of numerical integration methods (integrators) in order to optimize the performance. The standard we apply is the balance of the duo : precision obtained x running time. The numerical integration methods we have chosen, for this particular instance of association, were the Runge-Kutta of fourth order and seventheighth order. The algorithm was implemented in C++ language. The results showed an improvement in accuracy over the lower grade numerical integrator (actually, we have achieved, basically, the precision of the top integrator) with a processing time performance closer to the one of the lower grade integrator.

Other flow features such as freestream pressure gradients and streamwise boundary layer growth also strongly influence the skin friction. In this paper, an angular momentum integral (AMI) equation is introduced to quantify these effects by representing them as torques that alter the shape of the mean velocity profile. This approach uniquely isolates the skin friction of a Blasius boundary layer in a single term that depends only on the Reynolds number, so that other torques are interpreted as augmentations relative to the laminar case having the same Reynolds number. The AMI equation for external flows shares this key property with the so-called FIK relation for internal flows [Fukagata et al. 2002, Phys. Fluids, \\textbf{14}, L73-L76]. Without a geometrically imposed boundary layer thickness, the length scale in the Reynolds number for the AMI equation may be chosen freely. After a brief demonstration using Falkner-Skan boundary layers, the AMI equation is applied as a diagnostic tool on four transitional and turbulent boundary layer DNS datasets. Regions of negative wall-normal velocity are shown to play a key role in limiting the peak skin friction during the late stages of transition, and the relative strengths of terms in the AMI equation become independent of the transition mechanism a very short distance into the fully-turbulent regime. The AMI equation establishes an intuitive, extensible framework for interpreting the impact of turbulence and flow control strategies on boundary layer skin friction.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03043","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.074468","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicsflu-dyn","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Ahmed Elnahhas, Perry L.

Axonal growth, in particular, integrates deterministic guidance from substrate mechanics and geometry with stochastic fluctuations generated by signaling, molecular detection, cytoskeletal assembly, and growth cone dynamics. A comprehensive quantitative description of this process remains incomplete. We review stochastic models in which Langevin dynamics and the associates Fokker-Planck equation capture axonal motion and turning under combined biases and noise. Paired with experiments, these models yield key parameters, including effective diffusion (motility) coefficients, speed and angle distributions, mean-square displacement, and mechanical measures of cell-substrate coupling, thereby linking single-cell biophysics and intercellular interactions to collective growth statistics and network formation. We further couple the Fokker-Planck description to a mechanochemical actin-myosin-clutch model and perform a linear stability analysis of the resulting dynamics. Routh--Hurwitz criteria identify regimes of steady extension, damped oscillations, and Hopf bifurcations that generate sustained limit cycles. Together, these results clarify the mechanisms that govern axonal guidance and connectivity and inform the design of engineered substrates and neuroprosthetic scaffolds aimed at enhancing nerve repair and regeneration.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10723","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.074887","language":"en","tags":["q-bionc","physics","preprints","nlinao","physicsbio-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Cristian Staii","raw_content_length":1485,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Stochastic Models of Neuronal Growth arXiv:2205.10723v2 Announce Type","Fokker-Planck","Langevin"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1484,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Stochastic Models","Neuronal Growth","arXiv220510723v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Neuronal circuits","axons","dendrites","cells","Axonal growth","deterministic guidance"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["cells"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Stochastic Models":2.0,"Neuronal Growth":2.0,"arXiv220510723v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Neuronal circuits":1.0,"axons":1.0,"dendrites":1.0,"cells":1.0,"Axonal growth":1.0,"deterministic guidance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787512162222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9112,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0316,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.0151,"anger":0.011,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on stochastic models of neuronal growth, focusing on axonal motion and turning.

Here, we assume the application of TUS to individuals without contraindications, compromised thermoregulation, vascular vulnerabilities, or administered ultrasound contrast agents. In this context, we present a concise yet comprehensive set of levels for nonsignificant risks of TUS application. For mechanical effects, it is non-significant risk if the mechanical index (MI) or the mechanical index for transcranial application (MItc) does not exceed 1.9. For thermal effects, it is non-significant risk if any of the following three levels are met: the peak temperature rise does not exceed 2{\\deg}C or the peak absolute temperature does not exceed 39{\\deg}C, assuming a baseline temperature of 37{\\deg}C, the thermal dose does not exceed 2 CEM43 in brain tissue, 16 CEM43 in bone tissue, and 21 CEM43 in skin tissue, or specific values of the thermal index (TI) for a given exposure time. This report reflects a consensus expert opinion and can inform, but not replace, regulatory guidelines or official international standards. Similarly, this consensus can inform, but not replace, ethical evaluation, which weighs the total burden, risks, and benefits of the proposed action.

The voting systems considered are: Plurality, Borda, Dowdall, Top Two, Hare, Coombs, Baldwin, Copeland, Anti-Plurality, Nanson, Ranked Pairs, Pairwise Majority, and Minimax.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_f6ba0e4e0c4f","title":"Extending the trapping theorem to provide local stability guarantees for quadratically nonlinear models","content":"arXiv:2403.00324v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00324","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.076704","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicscomp-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Mai Peng, Alan Kaptanoglu, Chris Hansen, Jacob Stevens-Haas, Krithika Manohar, Steven L.

Many individual reactions in metabolism entail slightly endergonic steps that are coupled to free energy release, typically as ATP hydrolysis, in order to go forward. ATP is almost always supplied by the rotor-stator ATP synthase, which harnesses chemiosmotic ion gradients. Because the ATP synthase is a protein, it arose after the ribosome did. What was the energy currency of metabolism before the origin of the ATP synthase and how (and why) did ATP come to be the universal energy currency? About 27% of a cell's energy budget is consumed as GTP during translation. The universality of GTP-dependence in ribosome function indicates that GTP was the ancestral energy currency of protein synthesis. The use of GTP in translation and ATP in small molecule synthesis are conserved across all lineages, representing energetic compartments that arose in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA. And what came before GTP? Recent findings indicate that the energy supporting the origin of LUCA's metabolism stemmed from H2-dependent CO2 reduction along routes that strongly resemble the reactions and transition metal catalysts of the acetyl-CoA pathway.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08744","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.077096","language":"en","tags":["q-biobm","physics","preprints","physicsbio-ph","q-biope","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Natalia Mrnjavac, William F.

Comparison with published experimental data shows remarkably good agreement and demonstrates the predictive capability of the theoretical approach. While previous measurements by Feringa and coworkers [Chem.\\,Eur.\\,J.\\,(2017) 23, 6643] have shown that a replacement of the stereogenic hydrogen by a fluorine atom increases the relaxation time because of destabilization of the transition state for the thermal helix inversion, we find that a replacement of CH$_3$ by a CF$_3$ group at the same site shortens the relaxation time because of elevated energy of the metastable state without a significant shift in the transition state energy. Since these two fluorine substitutions have an opposite effect on the relaxation time, the two combined can provide a way to fine tune the rotational speed of a molecular motor.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18345","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.077909","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicschem-ph","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Ivan Tambovtsev, Yorick L.

Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18994","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.078755","language":"en","tags":["cond-matmtrl-sci","physicssoc-ph","physicsapp-ph","physicsdata-an","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Peter B{\\o}ggild, Timothy John Booth, Bjarke S{\\o}rensen Jessen, Abhay Shivayogimath, Nolan Lassaline, Stephan Hofmann, Kim Daasbjerg, Anders Smith, Kasper N{\\o}rgaard, Amaia Zurutuza, Terrance Barkan, Andrew J.

Specifically, education researchers and instructors have limited ability to observe the progression of student conceptual understanding throughout the course. Furthermore, instructors are limited in the usefulness of the feedback they can give to the students involved. To address these challenges, we propose an alternative approach that leverages computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and increasing the frequency of CAT-based assessments during the course, while reducing the test length per administration, thus keeping or decreasing the total number of test items administered throughout the course. The feasibility of this idea depends on how far the test length per administration can be reduced without compromising the test accuracy and precision. Specifically, the overall test length is desired to be shorter than when the full assessment is administered as a pretest and subsequent post-test. To achieve this goal, we developed a CAT algorithm that we call Chain-CAT. This algorithm sequentially links the results of each CAT administration using collateral information. We developed the Chain-CAT algorithm using the items of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and analyzed the efficiency by numerical simulations. We found that collateral information significantly improved the test efficiency, and the overall test length could be shorter than the pre-post method. Without constraints for item balancing and exposure control, simulation results indicated that the efficiency of Chain-CAT is comparable to that of the pre-post method even if the length of each CAT administration is only 5 items and the CAT is administered 9 times throughout the semester.

One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM and provide analytic bounds for the algorithm's error.

Our algorithm has all the theoretical benefits of Bryan's algorithm without these theoretical issues. We compare the MEM with Bryan's optimization to the MEM with our dual Newton optimization on test problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics and plasma physics. These comparisons show that in the presence of noise the dual Newton algorithm produces better estimates and error bars; this indicates the limits of Bryan's algorithm's applicability. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas at warm dense matter conditions and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01869","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:24.080793","language":"en","tags":["hep-lat","physicscomp-ph","physicsplasm-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Thomas Chuna, Nicholas Barnfield, Tobias Dornheim, Michael P.
