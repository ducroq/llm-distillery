{"id":"science_arxiv_math_6bee1c63fd5a","title":"Deep","content":"arXiv:2210.12406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Despite its popularity, several empirical and theoretical studies suggest that the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) has persistent issues in providing a substantial practical advantage. Numerical results for few qubits and shallow circuits are, at best, ambiguous, and the well-studied barren plateau phenomenon draws a rather sobering picture for deeper circuits. However, as more and more sophisticated strategies are proposed to circumvent barren plateaus, it stands to reason which issues are actually fundamental and which merely constitute - admittedly difficult - engineering tasks. By shifting the scope from the usually considered parameter landscape to the quantum state space's geometry we can distinguish between problems that are fundamentally difficult to solve, independently of the parameterization, and those for which there could at least exist a favorable parameterization. Here, we find clear evidence for a 'no free lunch'-behavior of QAOA on a general optimization task with no further structure; individual cases have, however, to be analyzed more carefully. Based on our analysis, we propose and justify a performance indicator for the deep-circuit QAOA that can be accessed by solely evaluating statistical properties of the classical objective function. We further discuss the various favorable properties a generic QAOA instance has in the asymptotic regime of infinitely many gates, and elaborate on the immanent drawbacks of finite circuits. We provide several numerical examples of a deep-circuit QAOA method based on local search strategies and find that - in alignment with our performance indicator - some special function classes, like QUBOs, indeed admit a favorable optimization landscape.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12406","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.624664","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":257,"author":"Gereon Ko{\\ss}mann, Lennart Binkowski, Lauritz van Luijk, Timo Ziegler, Ren\\'e Schwonnek","raw_content_length":1803,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.285,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["QAOA"],"persons":["barren plateaus"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1800,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["replace-cross Abstract","its popularity","several empirical and theoretical studies","the quantum approximate optimization","algorithm","QAOA","persistent issues","a substantial practical advantage","Numerical results","few qubits"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"its popularity":1.0,"several empirical and theoretical studies":1.0,"the quantum approximate optimization":1.0,"algorithm":1.0,"QAOA":1.0,"persistent issues":1.0,"a substantial practical advantage":1.0,"Numerical results":1.0,"few qubits":1.0}},"age_hours":2.796281083333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.430499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8861,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1681,"joy":0.0286,"surprise":0.0091,"sadness":0.7193,"fear":0.0094,"anger":0.0035,"disgust":0.062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the theoretical limitations and potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for optimization tasks, including those relevant to sustainability.

In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.628434","language":"en","tags":["hep-lat","math-ph","cond-matstr-el","hep-th","cond-matstat-mech","mathematics","preprints","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov","raw_content_length":1707,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.36,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ising","CFT"],"persons":[],"locations":["Newton"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1706,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the RG map","Transfer Matrix","Lattice Dilatation Operator","the fixed point","arXiv240913012v4 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Tensor network renormalization group maps","critical points","2d lattice models","the Ising model"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the RG map":3.0,"Transfer Matrix":2.0,"Lattice Dilatation Operator":2.0,"the fixed point":2.0,"arXiv240913012v4 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Tensor network renormalization group maps":1.0,"critical points":1.0,"2d lattice models":1.0,"the Ising model":1.0}},"age_hours":2.796417903611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8335,"joy":0.046,"surprise":0.0632,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0224,"anger":0.0217,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical methods for studying critical points in 2D lattice models.

We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs. On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \\geq 2$ and local dimension $n \\geq 5$.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.636895","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","mathoa","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":296,"author":"Aabhas Gulati, Ion Nechita, Sang-Jun Park","raw_content_length":1963,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.48,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PCP","linear","COP","PDEC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1958,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Positive maps","extendibility hierarchies","copositive matrices","PCOP","the cone","arXiv250915201v2","replace-cross Abstract","This work","a new convex cone","pairwise"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["pairwise"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Positive maps":2.0,"extendibility hierarchies":2.0,"copositive matrices":2.0,"PCOP":2.0,"the cone":2.0,"arXiv250915201v2":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"This work":1.0,"a new convex cone":1.0,"pairwise":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7966664536111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.592,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8574,"joy":0.0515,"surprise":0.0563,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.018,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

However, the dependency on sequencing depth severely restricts the reliability and accuracy of existing Hi-C tools, especially in single-cells. To address this issue, we introduce a novel computational framework based on the mean first passage time (MFPT) in Markov chain theory, which transforms chromatin contact matrices into a robust, distance-based representation. We demonstrate that MFPT representation is inherently insensitive to sequencing depth. Leveraging this transformation, we develop STRIDE (Spatial Topological Representation of Interaction Distance Evaluation), a parameter-free metric for library similarity. STRIDE is resilience to sparse and noisy data, insensitive to technical variabilities, and facilitates unsupervised embedding from single-cell Hi-C, enabling accurate delineation of cellular states and developmental trajectories. In conclusion, as a reliable computational framework for sparse and noisy data, STRIDE may serve as a base for wide range single-cell 3D genome analysis that used to be inconceivable.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681271v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.169309","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Xu, B., Gao, X., Tao, W., Zhang, Z., Li, F.","raw_content_length":1211,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.795,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["noisy data"],"persons":["Markov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1211,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["STRIDE","A Sequencing Depth","The study","three-dimensional 3D genome organization","high-throughput chromatin conformation capture technologies","Hi-C","its derivatives","the dependency","depth","the reliability"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["The study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"STRIDE":2.0,"A Sequencing Depth":2.0,"The study":1.0,"three-dimensional 3D genome organization":1.0,"high-throughput chromatin conformation capture technologies":1.0,"Hi-C":1.0,"its derivatives":1.0,"the dependency":1.0,"depth":1.0,"the reliability":1.0}},"age_hours":30.798896200833333,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.706,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4588,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9186,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0248,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0107,"anger":0.0168,"disgust":0.0159},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel computational framework (STRIDE) for analyzing 3D genome organization data.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c15a51877bba","title":"Cell","content":"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central hallmark of many optic neuropathies, yet the mechanisms linking intrinsic metabolic stress to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we developed conditional transgenic models targeting the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufs4 in the retina. Broad deletion of Ndufs4 in the retina resulted in vision loss, progressive RGC degeneration, and pronounced immune activation before overt RGC death. Strikingly, depletion of myeloid cells significantly preserved RGCs, demonstrating that inflammation is not simply a downstream consequence but a participant in the degeneration process. To further distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, we generated a mosaic model in which only subsets of retinal cells lacked Ndufs4. In this paradigm, the degeneration first appeared selectively in mutant regions, suggesting that mitochondrial impairment within RGCs is necessary to initiate vulnerability. At later stages, however, the degeneration extended beyond mutant territories, highly suggestive of a propagation through non-cell autonomous processes. Together, these findings support a model in which mitochondrial dysfunction creates the conditions for neuronal vulnerability, while immune responses govern the timing and extent of cell loss. This framework explains the consistent co-occurrence of metabolic deficits and neuroinflammation in optic neuropathies and highlights the importance of their interactions in disease progression. By clarifying the intersection of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, this work advances our understanding of RGC degeneration and provides a conceptual basis for deciphering pathogenic processes across diverse optic neuropathies.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681245v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.170484","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Santamaria-Munoz, D., Reyes, R.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_f1f59628abfc","title":"Machado noemt Nobelprijs 'grote erkenning voor Venezolaanse volk'","content":"\"O, mijn god. Ik heb er geen woorden voor.\" María Corina Machado reageerde vol ongeloof toen ze werd gebeld vanuit Oslo met het nieuws dat ze dit jaar de Nobelprijs voor de Vrede krijgt. De Venezolaanse oppositieleider was even sprakeloos, maar zei al snel dat ze de prijs niet in haar eentje verdient. \"Ik ben maar één iemand. Dit is een hele beweging, van de samenleving.\" Ze zei verder dat ze dankbaar was voor de prijs, die ze een grote erkenning voor het Venezolaanse volk noemde. \"We zijn nog niet waar we willen zijn, maar we doen wel erg ons best. Ik weet zeker dat we zullen winnen. De mensen verdienen het.\" De directeur van het Noorse Nobel-instituut was zichtbaar geëmotioneerd toen hij haar belde: Het is nog niet duidelijk of Machado in december zelf naar Oslo kan komen om de Nobelprijs in ontvangst te nemen. Ze is haar leven in Venezuela niet zeker en zit ondergedoken. Verschillende landen en organisaties hebben Machado inmiddels gefeliciteerd. De VN-mensenrechtencommissaris zegt dat de prijs een erkenning is \"voor de glasheldere wens van het Venezolaanse volk voor vrije en eerlijke verkiezingen\". De voorzitter van het Europees Parlement, Roberta Metsola, zegt dat ze enorm trots is op moedige Machado. \"Jouw onvermoeibare strijd voor vrijheid en democratie in Venezuela inspireert miljoenen mensen wereldwijd.\" Het Witte Huis was minder enthousiast. President Trump had publiekelijk zijn wens uitgesproken om de prijs te krijgen. Volgens zijn communicatiedirecteur vindt het Nobelcomité politiek belangrijker dan vrede. \"Er zal nooit iemand zijn zoals president Trump, die bergen kan verzetten met pure wilskracht.\" Nina Jurna, correspondent Latijns-Amerika: \"Machado probeert al jaren als oppositieleider om vrije verkiezingen van de grond te krijgen in Venezuela. Dat leek in 2024 te lukken, maar toen werd ze door Maduro toch uitgesloten van deelname. De hoop was groot, maar het werd een grote teleurstelling. Maduro claimde de overwinning, terwijl vrijwel iedereen ervan uitging dat de oppositie had gewonnen. Sindsdien zit ze ondergedoken. De mensen die ik heb gesproken zijn heel erg blij en trots. Het is een enorme opsteker voor de democratie en voor de Venezolanen zelf, die haar zien als een moederfiguur. Ze putten veel hoop uit deze prijs. Tegelijk is het een klap in het gezicht van het autoritaire regime, dat hiermee wordt neergezet als een dictatuur.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585952","published_date":"2025-10-10T12:28:26","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.374230","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":381,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2810,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Nobelprijs","Venezuela"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2392,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["grote erkenning","Venezolaanse volk","de prijs","mijn god","geen woorden","het nieuws","dit jaar","de Vrede","De Venezolaanse oppositieleider","Dit"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"grote erkenning":2.0,"Venezolaanse volk":2.0,"de prijs":2.0,"mijn god":1.0,"geen woorden":1.0,"het nieuws":1.0,"dit jaar":1.0,"de Vrede":1.0,"De Venezolaanse oppositieleider":1.0,"Dit":1.0}},"age_hours":0.4697925327777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5793,"joy":0.0187,"surprise":0.1624,"sadness":0.0682,"fear":0.06,"anger":0.0435,"disgust":0.0679},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Venezuelan opposition leader.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_37c4797a6140","title":"Duidelijke tegenstelling klimaat in doorrekening verkiezingsprogramma's","content":"Vooral linkse en progressieve partijen willen meer doen om de Nederlandse klimaatdoelen te halen. Middenpartij CDA doet dit in mindere mate. BBB en JA21 kiezen er juist voor om minder in te zetten op klimaat dan het huidige kabinet. Dat blijkt uit de doorrekening van het Centraal Planbureau (CPB), samen met het Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving (PBL). Diverse partijen, zoals SP, Forum voor Democratie, 50Plus en PVV, lieten hun plannen niet doorrekenen. Verdeeldheid CO2-heffing industrie Zeker bij het klimaatbeleid voor de industrie is een duidelijke tegenstelling zichtbaar. Partijen in het midden en op rechts willen af van de CO2-heffing voor de industrie. Terwijl vooral linkse en progressieve partijen eraan vast willen houden. Radiodebat De lijsttrekkers van vrijwel alle partijen gaan vanmiddag met elkaar in debat op NPO Radio 1. Het debat is behalve op de radio ook live te volgen op NOS.nl en NPO Politiek en Nieuws. Politieke partij Volt neem niet deel omdat de partij niet in debat wil over het thema klimaat met Forum voor Democratie. Ook Geert Wilders van de PVV is niet aanwezig, in verband met berichten dat hij doelwit zou zijn geweest van een Belgische terreurcel. Het huidige kabinet schortte op Prinsjesdag de heffing op, nadat een motie van het CDA hierover werd aangenomen. Bedrijven zouden vaak niet kunnen verduurzamen door vertraging in de bouw van pijpleidingen en kabels die hiervoor nodig zijn. Op dit moment streeft de overheid ernaar de uitstoot van gassen die de planeet opwarmen te verminderen. In 2030 zou de uitstoot 55 procent lager moeten zijn dan in 1990. Maar de kans dat dit wordt gehaald is zeer onwaarschijnlijk, stelde het PBL op Prinsjesdag. Het kabinet kwam wel met aanvullend beleid, maar dat leidt lang niet altijd tot minder uitstoot. Geen complete doorrekening De planbureaus maakten geen complete doorrekening van de klimaatplannen. Ze bekijken wel of de plannen van partijen het halen van klimaatdoelen dichterbij brengen of juist verder uit beeld, maar niet hoe groot de kans zou worden dat het doel wordt gehaald. Volgens de doorrekening leiden de plannen van GroenLinks-PvdA, D66, ChristenUnie en Volt tot een veel lagere uitstoot dan in de huidige kabinetsplannen. De maatregelen die het CDA wil nemen, doen dit in mindere mate. De manier waarop partijen dit doen verschilt wel. Vooral Volt kiest nadrukkelijk voor het afdwingen van klimaatbeleid door heffingen, bijvoorbeeld door een hogere energiebelasting. De partij geeft juist minder uit aan klimaat dan in het huidige beleid. Andere partijen proberen ook op andere manieren te verduurzamen. Zo willen GroenLinks-PvdA, VVD, CDA en ChristenUnie meer subsidies uitdelen. Verplaatsing naar buitenland Het nadrukkelijk inzetten op normen en heffingen leidt er wel toe dat Nederland minder aantrekkelijk wordt om te produceren. Daardoor kan uitstoot zich verplaatsen naar het buitenland, wat de daling in Nederland deels tenietdoet. De planbureaus constateren dat dit vooral gebeurt in de plannen van PvdA-GroenLinks, Volt en D66. De plannen van BBB en JA21 leiden ertoe dat de uitstoot minder daalt dan in het huidige beleid. Die partijen willen samen met NSC een belangrijke pot voor duurzaamheidssubsidies afschaffen. NSC, JA21 en BBB geven dan ook minder geld uit aan klimaat dan het huidige kabinet zich heeft voorgenomen. VVD en JA21 kiezen voor een lagere energiebelasting en accijnzen, maatregelen die ook kunnen leiden tot een hogere uitstoot.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585950","published_date":"2025-10-10T12:14:08","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.375541","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":543,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4233,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.715,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PBL","NPO","CDA","Radio 1","Forum voor Democratie","Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving","Centraal Planbureau","PVV","CPB"],"persons":["JA21"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3459,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["klimaat","Duidelijke tegenstelling","doorrekening","verkiezingsprogrammas","Vooral linkse en progressieve partijen","de Nederlandse klimaatdoelen","Middenpartij","mindere mate","het huidige kabinet","Dat"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"klimaat":3.0,"Duidelijke tegenstelling":2.0,"doorrekening":2.0,"verkiezingsprogrammas":2.0,"Vooral linkse en progressieve partijen":1.0,"de Nederlandse klimaatdoelen":1.0,"Middenpartij":1.0,"mindere mate":1.0,"het huidige kabinet":1.0,"Dat":1.0}},"age_hours":0.7081423400000001,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7417,"joy":0.019,"surprise":0.1021,"sadness":0.0345,"fear":0.0296,"anger":0.0355,"disgust":0.0375},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the climate plans of various political parties in the Netherlands and their potential impact on achieving the country's climate goals.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_1c183f452840","title":"Wilders voorlopig afwezig bij NOS Radiodebat vanwege bericht over dreiging","content":"Ook PVV-leider Geert Wilders zou een doelwit zijn geweest van de Belgische terreurcel die gisteren werd opgerold. Dat meldt een journalist van de Belgische commerciële omroep VTM Nieuws. In Nederland doet de NCTV er geen uitspraken over, maar Wilders doet vooralsnog niet mee aan het NOS-debat op NPO Radio 1 van vanmiddag. Hij schrijft op X dat wordt uitgezocht of het bericht van VTM klopt. \"Tot ik dat weet ga ik nergens heen\", laat hij weten. Wilders zou samen met de Belgische premier Bart De Wever en de Antwerpse burgemeester Els van Doesburg op een lijst staan van de verdachten die vastzitten voor een verijdelde terreuraanslag. Politie en justitie in België maakten gisteren bekend dat er drie jongeren uit Antwerpen zijn aangehouden die worden verdacht van een poging tot terroristische moord. Er zijn aanwijzingen dat zij een jihadistisch geïnspireerde terroristische aanslag wilden plegen op politici. De drie, volgens Belgische media 18, 23 en 24 jaar, zouden plannen hebben gehad om een aanslag te plegen met een drone, waarop een explosief bevestigd zou worden.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_05d15b14b681","title":"Taliban wil eigen vlag hijsen op ambassade in Duitsland","content":"Niet de zwart-rood-groene vlag, maar de witte Taliban-vlag met zwart opschrift moet voortaan op de ambassade in Berlijn waaien. En de naam zal veranderen van 'ambassade van de islamitische republiek Afghanistan', naar 'ambassade van Afghanistan'. Dat heeft een hoge ambtenaar van de Taliban laten weten in gesprek met journalisten van de Duitse zender ARD in Kabul. Het zorgt in Duitsland voor verdere discussie over de vraag of de Duitse regering de diplomatieke banden met de Taliban te veel aanhaalt. Vanwege hun mensenrechtenschendingen en grootschalige beperking van vrouwenrechten erkennen (behalve Rusland) andere landen de Taliban-regering niet die in 2021 de macht in Afghanistan overnam, noch het emiraat dat ze hebben uitgeroepen. Ook Duitsland heeft destijds om die reden de diplomatieke band met het land praktisch verbroken. Maar door binnenlandse druk om migranten die niet in Duitsland mogen blijven het land uit te krijgen, is dat aan het schuiven. Zeker na mesaanvallen dit en vorig jaar door asielzoekers die waren afgewezen maar niet konden worden uitgezet, groeit de frustratie onder Duitsers over de onmacht van de overheid. Ondertussen blijft de extreemrechtse anti-migratiepartij AfD verder groeien, en staat in sommige peilingen inmiddels op de eerste plek. Vaak blijkt het uitzetten van uitgeprocedeerde asielzoekers in de praktijk zeer lastig, bijvoorbeeld omdat mensen van de radar verdwijnen of het land van herkomst niet wil meewerken. Ook zijn er in het geval van Afghanistan zorgen over mogelijke folteringen bij terugkomst. Dat is ook de reden dat onder meer het Duitse instituut voor de rechten van de mens de regering eerder dit jaar nog adviseerde om geen mensen naar Afghanistan terug te sturen. Het tweede advies: \"versterk het aanzien van de de facto Taliban-regering niet door directe of indirecte onderhandelingen daarover\". Uitzetvluchten naar Afghanistan Afgelopen jaar zette de vorige Duitse regering van Scholz al 28 Afghaanse mannen op het vliegtuig die strafbare feiten hadden gepleegd en deels als gevaarlijk golden. Toen verliepen de gesprekken daarover niet direct met de Taliban in Kabul, maar indirect via Qatar. Dit jaar zette de huidige regering van Merz nog eens 81 mannen \"met een strafrechtelijk verleden\" op het vliegtuig, ook met hulp van Qatar. Maar om zulke vluchten regelmatiger mogelijk te maken, gaat deze regering duidelijk verder. Het Duitse ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken bevestigt inmiddels dat ambtenaren in Kabul zijn geweest om zelf directe gesprekken te voeren met de Taliban. Volgens een woordvoerder waren dat 'technische gesprekken' over de praktische afwikkeling van de vluchten en opname van de Afghanen. Daar hebben Duitsland en de Taliban nu afspraken over gemaakt. De Taliban zou daar niets voor terug hebben gekregen. Daar is in elk geval in de Duitse oppositie twijfel over. De Groenen spreken van \"geheime diplomatie met terroristen\". Ondertussen heeft Duitsland twee medewerkers geaccrediteerd die de Taliban naar Duitsland heeft gestuurd om de consulaten in Bonn en Berlijn te gaan leiden. Tot groot protest van de consul in Bonn en het overige personeel, dat daar al zat voordat de Taliban aan de macht kwamen. De voltallige staf is ruim een week geleden daarom opgestapt. In een brief zegt de vertrekkende consul de Taliban-medewerkers in Duitsland te zullen bijstaan bij het uitzetten van Afghanen. Tegelijk waarschuwt hij dat de veiligheid en vrijheid van Afghanen in Duitsland, Europa, Noord-Amerika en Australië in gevaar komt, regio's waarvoor het consulaat in Duitsland diensten uitvoert. \"In de afgelopen bijna vier jaar hebben wij de persoonlijke gegevens en documenten beschermd van honderdduizenden Afghaanse staatsburgers, in het bijzonder diegenen die via internationale programma's uit Afghanistan geëvacueerd werden. Ondanks flinke druk hebben wij dit materiaal nooit aan de Taliban gegeven.\" Om te voorkomen dat dit alsnog zal gebeuren verklaart hij dat ze alle documenten en andere bezittingen die hij en zijn personeel namens het consulaat hebben, overdraagt aan het Duitse ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken. Dat gebeurt op basis van het verdrag van Wenen voor diplomatiek verkeer. Hij noemt de Duitse accreditatie een legitimering van het Taliban-regime. Juristen in Duitsland wijzen er ondertussen op dat de Duitse overheid weinig kan doen tegen een Talibanvlag bij de ambassade, of een wijziging van de naam. De regering zou de diplomatieke relatie kunnen verbreken, maar dat lijkt op dit moment onwaarschijnlijk.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585948","published_date":"2025-10-10T11:56:20","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.377488","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":687,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4942,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.435,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ARD"],"persons":["Afghanistan"],"locations":["Berlijn","islamitische republiek","Duitsland","Kabul","Rusland","Taliban-vlag"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4523,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ambassade","eigen vlag","Niet de zwart-rood-groene vlag","de witte Taliban-vlag","zwart opschrift","de ambassade","de naam","de islamitische republiek","Dat","een hoge ambtenaar"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ambassade":4.0,"eigen vlag":2.0,"Niet de zwart-rood-groene vlag":1.0,"de witte Taliban-vlag":1.0,"zwart opschrift":1.0,"de ambassade":1.0,"de naam":1.0,"de islamitische republiek":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"een hoge ambtenaar":1.0}},"age_hours":1.004841775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7411,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0725,"sadness":0.0381,"fear":0.0489,"anger":0.0471,"disgust":0.043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a policy action where Germany is deporting Afghan migrants.

Bij de bedrijven Lashing Service en Matrans Marine Service wordt sinds woensdag gestaakt. Het zijn de enige twee sjordersbedrijven in de Rotterdamse haven. De sjorders zijn verantwoordelijk voor het vastzetten en losmaken van containers. Ze hebben het werk neergelegd voor een betere cao. Vakbond FNV had eerst gevraagd om een loonsverhoging van 7 procent, maar dat is inmiddels bijgesteld naar 6,5 procent. Afgelopen woensdag gaven de sjordersbedrijven al aan te verwachten dat de staking een behoorlijke impact zou hebben op de haven. \"De terminals liggen grotendeels plat. Uiteindelijk kan dat ook leiden tot een wachtrij in de havenmonding. Schepen kunnen niet laden en niet lossen\", zei Erik Bouwens van Matrans Marine Services. Volgens haveneconoom Martijn Streng wordt de impact steeds groter. \"Gisteren zei het havenbedrijf dat er dertien schepen voor anker lagen, maar dat worden er nu alleen maar meer.\" Toch verwacht Streng niet dat de schepen zullen uitwijken naar andere havens.

De Europese Unie investeert ruim 71 miljoen euro in het project, waardoor de financiering helemaal rond is. Met bijdragen van het Rijk en de Economische Agenda van Nij Begun komt de totale investering uit op zo'n 200 miljoen euro. In de stad wordt een expertisecentrum voor kunstmatige intelligentie (AI) ingericht. De 'AI-fabriek' komt in het voormalige Niemeyer-gebouw aan de Paterswoldseweg. Het markante pand, symbool van de aloude tabaksindustrie, krijgt zo een nieuw leven als broedplek voor ontwikkelingen op het gebied van kunstmatige intelligentie, schrijft RTV Noord. Met de Europese bijdrage sluit Groningen zich aan bij het EuroHPC-netwerk, een Europees samenwerkingsverband met andere AI-fabrieken. De EU maakte vorig jaar bekend te willen investeren in supercomputers, om zo minder afhankelijk te worden van tech-giganten uit de Verenigde Staten en China. De plannen voor de AI-fabriek lagen al langer op tafel. Eerder stelde het kabinet 70 miljoen euro beschikbaar en ook vanuit de Economische Agenda van Nij Begun ligt er 60 miljoen euro. Met de Europese bijdrage is het project nu volledig gefinancierd en kan de uitvoering beginnen. Kennis en werkgelegenheid De 'AI-fabriek' moet een plek worden waar onderzoekers, bedrijven en overheden samenwerken aan slimme toepassingen van kunstmatige intelligentie. Deze toepassingen kunnen worden ontwikkeld voor sectoren als de landbouw, zorg en het bedrijfsleven. De verwachting is dat het expertisecentrum halverwege 2026 opent. De supercomputer die gebouwd wordt moet begin 2027 operationeel zijn.

De bewoners troffen het stuk marmer bij het tuinieren aan onder het kreupelhout. Ryan Gray kreeg afgelopen maart een belletje dat Daniella Santoro iets bijzonders had gevonden. Omdat ze in het stuk steen een grafzerk herkende, vreesde ze dat haar huis misschien op een verlaten begraafplaats was gebouwd. De waarheid bleek vreemder. Gray zag dat de inscriptie in het Latijn was en kon via via een vertaling krijgen. Het bleek om tekst uit de eerste eeuwen van de jaartelling te gaan. \"Aan de geesten der doden voor Sextus Congenius Verus, soldaat van de pretoriaanse vloot van Miseno, Thraciër, 42 jaar oud, 22 jaar in dienst, welverdiend voor hem gemaakt door zijn erfgenamen.\" Verwoest museum De tekst bleek ooit al eens te zijn geregistreerd. \"Een steen met precies deze tekst bleek te missen uit een museum in het Italiaanse Civitavecchia, in de buurt waar hij ooit was gevonden\", ontdekte Gray met hulp van zijn Team Tombstone van experts. De steen bleek te zijn kwijtgeraakt toen het museum in de Tweede Wereldoorlog grotendeels werd verwoest bij Amerikaanse bombardementen. Gray besloot daarom zijn vondst bij de afdeling geroofde kunst van de FBI te melden. Speurtocht Ondertussen ging hij zelf door met het uitpluizen van hoe het voorwerp aan de andere kant van de Atlantische Oceaan was terechtgekomen. De eerdere eigenaren van het huis hadden geen band met Italië, een buurman bleek in de Tweede Wereldoorlog soldaat te zijn geweest, maar had alleen in het Stille Oceaangebied gediend. \"Misschien is de steen ooit in handen van een handelaar gevallen en aan een toerist verkocht in de jaren na de oorlog\", speculeert Gray. \"Wellicht dacht een familielid bij het uitruimen wel dat het een handige stoeptegel was voor de modderige tuin.\" De archeoloog is verheugd te kunnen melden dat de steen binnenkort weer teruggaat naar Italië. Dat hij voorlopig nog geen definitief antwoord heeft, neemt hij voor lief. \"Hoewel ik al 25 jaar archeoloog ben in New Orleans, blijven er altijd verrassingen en mysteries om uit te zoeken.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585945","published_date":"2025-10-10T11:26:54","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.379551","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":358,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2326,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Daniella Santoro","Eeuwenoude Romeinse","Sextus Congenius"],"locations":["Miseno","kreupelhout","New Orleans"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2180,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Eeuwenoude Romeinse grafsteen","archeoloog","het stuk","Een archeoloog","bijna 2000 jaar","een tuin","de Amerikaanse stad","De bewoners","marmer","een belletje"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Eeuwenoude Romeinse grafsteen":2.0,"archeoloog":2.0,"het stuk":2.0,"Een archeoloog":1.0,"bijna 2000 jaar":1.0,"een tuin":1.0,"de Amerikaanse stad":1.0,"De bewoners":1.0,"marmer":1.0,"een belletje":1.0}},"age_hours":1.495446131111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.685,"joy":0.0198,"surprise":0.1374,"sadness":0.0407,"fear":0.0462,"anger":0.035,"disgust":0.0359},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes the discovery of a Roman gravestone and the efforts to return it to Italy.

Als de man doorgaat met de discriminatie op basis van geslacht, riskeert hij een boete van 10.000 euro. Het is de eerste keer dat de gemeente Amsterdam ingrijpt bij de verdenking van discriminatie bij verhuurders, meestal is er niet genoeg bewijs. De verhuurder kwam bij de gemeente in beeld door een melding van een woningzoekende. Die zou door de verhuurder zijn geweigerd omdat hij man is. En dit bleek vaker te gebeuren: in de huurcontracten stond dat huurders \"Nederlandse werkende dames\" zijn. Ook online schreef de verhuurder alleen aan vrouwen te verhuren. De verhuurder heeft twee weken de tijd om de gemeente zijn kant van het verhaal te vertellen. Past hij zijn beleid en huurcontracten niet aan, dan krijgt hij een boete van 10.000 euro opgelegd, schrijft de regionale omroep NH. Discriminatie Sinds 1 januari vorig jaar handhaaft het team Goed Verhuurderschap van de gemeente op intimidatie door verhuurders, te hoge waarborgsommen, onduidelijke of te hoge servicekosten en discriminatie bij het selecteren van huurders. Er is een meldpunt waar huurders met hun vragen terecht kunnen. Het aantonen van met name discriminatie is ingewikkeld: vaak ontbreekt schriftelijk of digitaal bewijs. De gemeente adviseert huurders of woningzoekenden die te maken hebben met discriminatie bewijs te verzamelen, zoals een e-mail of opgenomen telefoongesprek. \"Of het nu discriminatie vanwege huidskleur, geloof, seksuele geaardheid of geslacht betreft: het is allemaal niet toegestaan\", schrijft wethouder Zita Pels. \"Wij zullen altijd proberen op te treden tegen dit soort gedrag.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585943","published_date":"2025-10-10T10:36:07","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.380285","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":260,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1922,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["gemeente Amsterdam"],"monetary":["10.000 euro"]},"char_count":1706,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["euro","de gemeente","Amsterdamse verhuurder","mannelijke huurders","boete","Een Amsterdamse verhuurder","die","mannen","huurder","de vingers"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"euro":3.0,"de gemeente":3.0,"Amsterdamse verhuurder":2.0,"mannelijke huurders":2.0,"boete":2.0,"Een Amsterdamse verhuurder":1.0,"die":1.0,"mannen":1.0,"huurder":1.0,"de vingers":1.0}},"age_hours":2.3418514202777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8042,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.0605,"sadness":0.0209,"fear":0.0247,"anger":0.0372,"disgust":0.0405},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a policy action by the city of Amsterdam to combat discrimination in housing rentals.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_36738bb577f3","title":"'Elke minuut telt': hulporganisaties willen zo snel mogelijk Gaza in","content":"Sinds de vreugde over het bestand is er in Gaza nog niet veel veranderd: humanitair is de situatie nog steeds schrijnend. Hulporganisaties in de startblokken voor een enorme hulpoperatie - zo gauw Israël dat toestaat. Een van de afspraken in het akkoord is dat de Israëlische troepen zich terugtrekken achter een gele lijn en dat humanitaire hulp onbelemmerd naar het gebied in kan. Komend weekend mogen 400 vrachtwagens per dag Gaza in, zegt Daniëlle Brouwer van het Rode Kruis. \"Maar dat is een druppel op de gloeiende plaat. Wat we willen is dat de trucks ongelimiteerd naar binnen kunnen. Als er duizend klaarstaan wil je er duizend naar binnen hebben.\" Hongersnood De hulpverleningsorganisaties staan voor een kolossale taak. De VN heeft 170.000 ton voedsel, medicijnen en andere hulpgoederen klaarstaan aan de grens om 2,1 miljoen mensen te voeden, zegt Tom Fletcher, hoofd humanitaire zaken van de VN. Tot nu toe mag er maar 20 procent Gaza in van wat er eigenlijk nodig is. Hij gaat ervan uit dat volgens het vredesakkoord de hulp snel volledig wordt toegelaten. Dat is harder nodig dan ooit. In Noord-Gaza is een hongersnood vastgesteld en er is tekort aan alles, weten ze ook bij het Rode Kruis. \"Er is specialistische voeding nodig, medicijnen en groente en fruit. Er is nu bijna alleen maar rijst en meel.\" Vanochtend waren er nog steeds bombardementen in Gaza te zien: De vraag is hoe die hulp zo snel mogelijk bij degenen komt die het het hardst nodig hebben. \"Daarvoor wil je ervoor zorgen dat er genoeg hulp tegelijk binnenkomt, om plunderingen te voorkomen.\" Er zijn daarom honderden voedseldistributiepunten nodig, zegt Brouwer. \"Elke minuut telt. Onze hulpverleners staan echt te popelen om naar binnen te gaan\". Het Rode Kruis richt zich vooral op medische zorg die net zo hard nodig is. \"We faciliteren twee ziekenhuizen in Gaza en we willen kleine mobiele klinieken opzetten, ook om mensen met ondervoeding te helpen. Als je zolang zonder voldoende eten zit, moet je niet opeens heel veel rijst gaan eten. Dat moet langzaam worden opgebouwd, onder toezicht van artsen.\" Gewonden Daarnaast is er veel basiszorg nodig. Het Rode Kruis schat dat er zo'n 170.000 mensen gewond zijn geraakt tijdens de oorlog. \"Bijna iedereen heeft wel een of andere vorm van basiszorg nodig. Veel operaties zijn uitgesteld en er zijn hersteloperaties nodig. Er moet ook een extra veldziekenhuis komen.\" De magazijnen liggen verder vol met dekens en tenten, want er komt kouder weer aan en talloze Gazanen zijn dakloos. Tot nu toe mochten die goederen vaak niet de grens over omdat het Israëlische leger bang was dat Hamas de middelen voor andere doeleinden zou gebruiken, net als brandstof. Onterecht, volgens het Rode Kruis. \"Als hulporganisatie weten we heel goed waar de hulp terecht komt\", verzekert Brouwer. \"Als er al hulp in mocht moest het allemaal gecontroleerd worden en overgeladen worden in andere trucks, nodeloos ingewikkeld. We hopen dat dat nu niet meer hoeft. We leven een beetje tussen hoop en vrees op dit moment.\" Salih El Saddy, een Rotterdamse arts die vorig jaar een maand in een ziekenhuis is Gaza werkte, heeft dagelijks contact met collega's in het gebied. \"Er is op dit moment tekort aan alles, alles, alles\", zegt hij. \"Wat eerst schaars was, is nu op. Er zijn nauwelijks nog narcosemiddelen bijvoorbeeld, en veel apparatuur is kapot, doorzeefd door kogels, couveuses, dialyse-apparaten. Cruciale zorg wordt niet meer gegeven.\" Het tekort aan vitaminen en eiwitten leidt tot bloedarmoede en andere complicaties. \"Mensen worden sneller ziek, en dat zie je ook. Voor kinderen is dat nog erger. Er komt ook geen babyvoeding binnen. Als arts is dat frustrerend om te zien, vooral omdat het een bewuste keuze is die hulp niet toe te laten. Het is onmenselijk.\" El Saddy is voorzichtig met optimisme over het bestand dat nu is gesloten. \"In januari was er ook een wapenstilstand, Er kan altijd een punt komen waarop Israël een reden ziet om de afspraken weer laten te vervallen. Het gaat Israël vooral om het terughalen van de gijzelaars. Wat er daarna gebeurt blijft onzeker.\" Juliette Verhoeven van Dutch Relief Allience, een overkoepelend verband van hulporganisaties, denkt er hetzelfde over. \"We verwelkomen het bestand, maar we hebben ook wel wat zorgen omdat Israël geen goed trackrecord heeft wat betreft het houden aan afspraken. Dus we kijken er met enige scepsis naar.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585938","published_date":"2025-10-10T10:09:10","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.381483","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":723,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4671,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.615,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Daniëlle Brouwer van het Rode","Tom Fletcher"],"locations":["Israël","Gaza"],"monetary":["2,1 miljoen mensen te voeden, zegt"]},"char_count":4402,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gaza","Elke minuut","hulporganisaties","dat","de vreugde","het bestand","de situatie","de startblokken","een enorme hulpoperatie","de afspraken"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gaza":3.0,"Elke minuut":2.0,"hulporganisaties":2.0,"dat":2.0,"de vreugde":1.0,"het bestand":1.0,"de situatie":1.0,"de startblokken":1.0,"een enorme hulpoperatie":1.0,"de afspraken":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7910357283333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6943,"joy":0.0175,"surprise":0.0916,"sadness":0.0565,"fear":0.0729,"anger":0.0444,"disgust":0.0229},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a humanitarian aid operation in Gaza, focusing on the delivery of food, medicine, and other essential supplies.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_17eed03ad1c5","title":"Start aanpak veiligheid stations Almelo, Purmerend, Bergen op Zoom","content":"Nog voor het einde van het jaar gaat de overheid samen met reizigers kijken hoe de treinstations van Almelo, Purmerend en Bergen op Zoom veiliger gemaakt kunnen worden. Over deze treinstations komen de meeste signalen binnen over onveiligheid. Op Prinsjesdag maakte het demissionaire kabinet al bekend 20 miljoen euro uit te trekken om de veiligheid in het openbaar vervoer te verbeteren. Demissionair staatssecretaris Aartsen zei voor aanvang van het wekelijkse kabinetsberaad vanmorgen zich veel zorgen te maken over de signalen uit het Openbaar Vervoer. \"Iedere dag worden er gemiddeld gezien drie NS-medewerkers zwaar mishandeld of bedreigd. En heel veel mensen, vooral jonge vrouwen, voelen zich 's avonds onveilig in het openbaar vervoer.\" De komende maanden wordt op de drie stations samen met reizigers gekeken waar de grootste problemen zijn. \"Waar moeten meer camera's komen, waar meer poortjes, moet er meer verlichting komen, wat zijn de smoezelige plekken? Daar gaan we snel mee aan de slag.\" Op het station van Purmerend werden vorig jaar twee tieners opgepakt voor het mishandelen van een conducteur. Het aantal meldingen van NS-personeel over agressie steeg in in 2023 met 30 procent, meldde de NS. Na de drie stations is het de bedoeling ook op andere plekken aan de slag te gaan. Veel vrouwen voelen zich onveilig Vrouwen voelen zich vaker onveilig dan mannen. Bijna de helft van de vrouwen zegt af en toe om te lopen of om te rijden om plekken te vermijden die ze als onveilig inschatten. In Nederland krijgen relatief veel vrouwen te maken met geweld vergeleken met de rest van Europa. Na de moord in augustus op de 17-jarige Lisa uit Abcoude voelen veel jonge vrouwen zich nog onveiliger op straat. Zo'n 4000 jonge vrouwen zeggen tegen NOS Stories zich altijd al onveilig te voelen op straat. Voor 1600 van hen is dat gevoel sinds de dood van Lisa nog sterker geworden. Na haar dood zijn meer mensen in gesprek gegaan over femicide, geweld tegen vrouwen en het gevoel van onveiligheid op straat. Dat laten jongeren weten in de vragenlijst van NOS Stories. Ook met mannen wordt hierover gepraat, om zo meer bewustzijn te creëren. \"We moeten vaker het gesprek voeren dat het niet normaal is dat vrouwen bang zijn op straat\", zegt iemand.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585937","published_date":"2025-10-10T09:58:49","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.384222","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":373,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2983,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Almelo"],"persons":[],"locations":["Bergen op Zoom"],"monetary":["20 miljoen euro"]},"char_count":2256,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["aanpak","stations","Nog voor het einde","het jaar","de overheid","reizigers","de treinstations","deze treinstations","de meeste signalen","onveiligheid"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"aanpak":2.0,"stations":2.0,"Nog voor het einde":1.0,"het jaar":1.0,"de overheid":1.0,"reizigers":1.0,"de treinstations":1.0,"deze treinstations":1.0,"de meeste signalen":1.0,"onveiligheid":1.0}},"age_hours":2.9635516222222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3765,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0269,"sadness":0.0178,"fear":0.4871,"anger":0.0597,"disgust":0.0199},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a government initiative to improve safety at train stations, allocating 20 million euros.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_349f5f02503a","title":"Staakt","content":"In Gaza is het staakt-het-vuren officieel ingegaan. Dat is gebeurd om 12.00 uur lokale tijd, 11.00 uur in Nederland, nadat het Israëlische leger was begonnen aan zijn terugtrekking zoals afgesproken met Hamas. \"Sinds 12.00 uur hebben onze troepen zich gepositioneerd op de bijgewerkte inzetlinies, in overeenstemming met de hoofdlijnen van het staakt-het-vuren en de overeenkomst inzake de teruggave van de gijzelaars\", meldt het leger. De Israëlische premier Netanyahu noemde de ontwikkelingen in een toespraak, die wereldwijd op tv-stations werd uitgezonden, een overwinning voor zijn land. Volgens hem was de terugtrekking van het leger en de vrijlating van alle gijzelaars niet eerder mogelijk, omdat Hamas nu pas \"het mes op de keel\" kreeg gezet. Dank aan Trump Netanyahu bedankte in zijn toespraak de militairen \"die ons land hebben beschermd\" en sprak ook zijn dank uit voor de Amerikaanse president Trump, die volgens Netanyahu \"leiderschap toonde en zijn grootsheid heeft laten zien\". Netanyahu noemde in zijn dankwoord eveneens de Amerikaanse onderhandelaars Steve Witkoff en Jared Kushner. Netanyahu zei dat de Israëlische gijzelaars die nog in handen zijn van Hamas de komende dagen terugkeren. Volgens het akkoord laat Hamas nu binnen 72 uur alle gijzelaars vrij, van wie er twintig vermoedelijk nog in leven zijn. Hoeveel er worden vrijgelaten en wanneer precies, is niet bekend. Troepen blijven Netanyahu zei ook dat het Israëlische leger voorlopig wel in Gaza blijft. Het wordt niet geheel teruggetrokken, ook niet in de tweede fase van het akkoord, om de druk op Hamas om zich te ontwapenen hoog houden. Uit een deel van Gaza zijn de troepen vertrokken, maar het leger is nog aanwezig in 53 procent van het Palestijnse gebied. Het is wel de bedoeling dat het Israëlische leger zich in een later stadium bijna helemaal terugtrekt uit Gaza. Er zijn nog twistpunten tussen Israël en Hamas. Zo eist Israël ook de volledige ontwapening van Hamas, maar de beweging heeft dat idee verworpen. Over het toekomstige bestuur van de Gazastrook zijn de partijen het ook nog niet eens. Volksverhuizing In de Gazastrook is inmiddels een grote volksverhuizing op gang gekomen. Op beelden is te zien hoe via de kustweg vanuit het zuiden een lange rij Palestijnen naar het noorden trekt, richting Gaza-Stad. De kustweg was deze maand juist afgesloten door het Israëlische leger, maar is nu weer open. De Palestijnen trekken naar gebied dat ze moesten verlaten vanwege het Israëlische offensief. Ook op andere plekken waar het Israëlische leger zich heeft teruggetrokken, keren Palestijnen terug. Ook hulporganisaties maken zich klaar om de Gazastrook in te trekken. Verwacht wordt dat Israël in eerste instantie 400 tot 600 vrachtwagens met hulpgoederen zal toelaten.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585935","published_date":"2025-10-10T09:51:34","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.385199","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":434,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2974,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Netanyahu","Trump Netanyahu","Trump","Hamas"],"locations":["Nederland","Netanyahu","Hamas"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2766,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["uur","het staakt-het-vuren","Gaza","Dat","lokale tijd","het Israëlische leger","zijn terugtrekking","onze troepen","de bijgewerkte inzetlinies","overeenstemming"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"uur":3.0,"het staakt-het-vuren":2.0,"Gaza":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"lokale tijd":1.0,"het Israëlische leger":1.0,"zijn terugtrekking":1.0,"onze troepen":1.0,"de bijgewerkte inzetlinies":1.0,"overeenstemming":1.0}},"age_hours":3.084401263333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8059,"joy":0.0077,"surprise":0.0631,"sadness":0.0267,"fear":0.0292,"anger":0.036,"disgust":0.0315},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":2,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a ceasefire agreement and troop withdrawal in Gaza.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_6c520693c6e1","title":"Motief voor verijdelde politieke aanslag in België nog onduidelijk","content":"Het blijft raden naar het motief achter de verijdelde politieke aanslag in België. Gisteren pakte de Belgische politie drie jongeren uit Antwerpen op, die worden verdacht van een poging tot terroristische moord. Volgens Belgische media was die gericht op premier Bart De Wever. De Belgische justitie wil dat nog steeds niet bevestigen. \"Er zijn aanwijzingen dat het de bedoeling was om een jihadistisch geïnspireerde terroristische aanslag te plegen die gericht was op politici\", zei federaal procureur Ann Fransen gisteravond alleen op een persconferentie van het Belgische Openbaar Ministerie. Volgens de Belgische media was ook de Antwerpse burgemeester Els van Doesburg, net als De Wever ook van de N-VA, een mogelijk doelwit. Zowel Van Doesburg als De Wever zijn door de politie op de hoogte gebracht, meldt de Belgische krant Het Laatste Nieuws. Luchtige reactie De Belgische premier reageerde vanochtend luchtig en met humor op het nieuws. Bij de start van de begrotingsonderhandelingen in Brussel liet hij zich kort zien en stak zijn duim omhoog toen hem werd gevraagd of hij opgelucht was en alles onder controle heeft. En op sociale media is een grapje geplaatst, op de Instagram-pagina van de kat die in het kantoor van de premier woont. \"Maximus, kan jij een drone vangen?\", vraagt De Wever in een tekstballonnetje aan de poes. \"Een droom vangen? Als de beste!\", luidt daarop het ludieke antwoord. De verdachten zouden een drone hebben willen gebruiken voor de aanslag. Verdachten De drie jongeren die zijn opgepakt, zijn 18, 23 en 24 jaar oud. Alle drie zijn ze Belg, de jongste en de oudste zouden van Marokkaanse afkomst zijn, de 23-jarige van Tsjetsjeense afkomst. Ze kenden elkaar persoonlijk, schrijft de VRT. Volgens de Vlaamse omroep ging gisteren het gerucht dat de drie jongeren het gemunt hadden op politici met pro-Israëlische standpunten, maar volgens de omroep klopt dat niet. Het onderzoek is in september begonnen, meldt de Belgische krant Het Laatste Nieuws. Eerst zijn er twee verdachten in het vizier van de politie gekomen en door verder onderzoek is ook de derde gevonden. De 24-jarige verdachte werd gisteren alweer vrijgelaten, wegens gebrek aan bewijs. De andere twee worden vandaag voorgeleid aan de onderzoeksrechter. De 18-jarige studeerde Defensie en Veiligheid op een middelbare school in Antwerpen en de 23-jarige verdachte zou cybersecurity-opleiding volgen aan een hogeschool. De Belgische politie onderzoekt nog of het drietal contact had met andere radicalen. Zelfgemaakt explosief De politie voerde in Antwerpen vier huiszoekingen uit. Bij een van de verdachten werd een zelfgemaakt explosief gevonden. \"Dat had sterke gelijkenissen met een IED, een improvised explosive device\", zei Fransen. Het explosief zou nog niet actief geweest zijn, maar zou dat wel op korte termijn kunnen zijn. Bij die verdachte werd ook een \"zak met stalen balletjes\" gevonden. Bij een tweede verdachte is onder meer een 3D-printer gevonden, \"waarvan kan worden vermoed dat deze moest dienen om onderdelen voor de aanslag te maken\", maakte Fransen bekend. Mogelijk was het de bedoeling om een drone te maken waarop een lading bevestigd zou worden. Premier Schoof heeft zijn steun overgebracht aan zijn Belgische collega en beloofde België te helpen bij het bestrijden van terrorisme. Het dreigingsniveau in België blijft voorlopig ongewijzigd. Het staat nu op 3 op een schaal van 4. Dat betekent dat de dreiging 'ernstig' is en dat een aanslag als 'mogelijk en waarschijnlijk' wordt ingeschat. De Belgische procureur vertelde ook nog dat de Belgische justitie dit jaar al zo'n tachtig nieuwe terreuronderzoeken is begonnen. \"Dat zijn er nu al meer dan het totaal aantal dossiers in 2024\", aldus Fransen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585930","published_date":"2025-10-10T09:14:38","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.387162","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":586,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4504,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["N-VA","Motief voor verijdelde politieke"],"persons":["Els van Doesburg","Van Doesburg","De Wever","Ann Fransen","Bart De Wever"],"locations":["Antwerpen","België","Gisteren"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3728,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["die","Motief","verijdelde politieke aanslag","het motief","de verijdelde politieke aanslag","de Belgische politie","een poging","terroristische moord","Belgische media","premier"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"die":3.0,"Motief":2.0,"verijdelde politieke aanslag":2.0,"het motief":1.0,"de verijdelde politieke aanslag":1.0,"de Belgische politie":1.0,"een poging":1.0,"terroristische moord":1.0,"Belgische media":1.0,"premier":1.0}},"age_hours":3.6999889733333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.842,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8316,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3815,"joy":0.0175,"surprise":0.0471,"sadness":0.0493,"fear":0.3332,"anger":0.0898,"disgust":0.0816},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"transition_delay","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":1,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article discusses a foiled terrorist plot involving a drone and explosives.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_5d2a472400a1","title":"Venezolaanse oppositieleider Machado wint Nobelprijs voor de Vrede","content":"De Nobelprijs voor de Vrede gaat dit jaar naar de Venezolaanse oppositieleider María Corina Machado, heeft het Noorse Nobelcomité bekendgemaakt. Ze krijgt de prijs vanwege haar onvermoeibare inzet voor de democratie in haar land: ze is fel tegenstander van het regime-Maduro. De 58-jarige Machado staat volgens het comité voor \"een rechtvaardige en vreedzame overgang van een dictatuur naar een democratie\". Ze wordt een moedige en vastberaden voorvechter van vrede genoemd, \"die het vuur van de democratie laat branden te midden van groeiende duisternis\". Voor haar werk kreeg ze ook al de belangrijkste mensenrechtenprijs van de Europese Unie. Machado werd door Maduro uitgesloten van deelname aan de verkiezingen in de zomer van vorig jaar, waarna de oppositie een andere kandidaat naar voren schoof. Maduro werd tot winnaar van de verkiezingen uitgeroepen, maar bewijs voor de winst leverde de kiescommissie niet. De oppositie zegt dat er op grote schaal is gefraudeerd. In Venezuela gebleven Presidentskandidaat Edmundo González ontvluchtte het land anderhalve maand later, nadat hij wekenlang had geschuild in de Nederlandse ambassade. Machado deed dat niet en leeft sindsdien ondergedoken. Het Nobelcomité prijst haar moed om in Venezuela te blijven en daar oppositie te voeren tegen de dictatuur. In januari verscheen ze voor het eerst in maanden weer in het openbaar en werd gelijk opgepakt. Volgens de voorzitter van het comité zei Machado, toen ze werd gebeld met het nieuws, dat dit een prijs is voor de hele beweging. Ook González belde met Machado en feliciteerde haar: Met de uitverkiezing van Machado passeert het Nobelcomité de Amerikaanse president Trump, die ook was genomineerd en openlijk had gelonkt naar de eer. \"Iedereen vindt dat ik de Nobel Vredesprijs moet krijgen\", zei hij bij de Algemene Vergadering van de VN. \"Maar ik geef niet om prijzen, het gaat mij om het redden van levens.\" Toch had hij naar verluidt uit het niets de prominente Noorse politicus Jens Stoltenberg gebeld om hem om de prijs te vragen. Ook pochte hij geregeld dat hij \"een einde had gemaakt\" aan maar liefst zeven oorlogen, van het conflict tussen Armenië en Azerbeidzjan tot de korte oorlog tussen India en Pakistan. Op die optelsom valt wel wat af te dingen: vaak werd slechts een korte crisis in een langer conflict bezworen en in één geval kwam het juist tot een escalatie van de strijd. Ook de timing van het akkoord tussen Israël en Hamas leek nog gunstig, precies enkele dagen voor de bekendmaking van het Nobelcomité, maar op dat moment was de nominatieperiode al gesloten. Namen konden worden voordragen tot 31 januari dit jaar, dus vlak na het aantreden van Trump was de inzending al gesloten. Commissie van vijf Onder de 338 nominaties waren dit jaar 244 individuen en 94 organisaties. Wie precies, wordt 50 jaar lang geheimgehouden. Namen mogen worden voorgedragen door een selecte groep, zoals wereldleiders, internationale politici, eerdere winnaars en leden van het Nobelcomité zelf. Wie de prijs krijgt, wordt bepaald door een commissie die is aangesteld door het Noorse parlement. Onder de vijf leden zijn een mensenrechtenadvocaat, oud-ministers en een buitenlandexpert. Voorzitter Jørgen Watne Frydnes erkende dat Trumps belangrijkste diplomatieke overwinning, het bestand tussen Israël en Hamas, best in aanmerking kan komen. \"Als iemand erin slaagt vrede te brengen in het Midden-Oosten, zal de tijd uitwijzen of die de prijs verdient.\" Maar, voegde hij eraan toe, \"voor toekomstige prijzen moeten we wachten tot oktober volgend jaar\". In het verleden hebben vier Amerikaanse presidenten de prijs gewonnen: Theodore Roosevelt voor zijn bemiddeling in de Russisch-Japanse oorlog, Woodrow Wilson voor de Volkenbond, Jimmy Carter voor zijn liefdadigheidswerk en Barack Obama voor zijn bijdrage aan de internationale diplomatie.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2585928","published_date":"2025-10-10T09:02:37","collected_date":"2025-10-10T12:50:57.388619","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":600,"author":null,"raw_content_length":5215,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Maduro","Corina Machado"],"locations":["Nobelprijs","Europese Unie"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3847,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["de Vrede","Venezolaanse oppositieleider","dit jaar","de Venezolaanse oppositieleider","de prijs","haar onvermoeibare inzet","de democratie","haar land","het regime-Maduro","het comité"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"de Vrede":3.0,"Venezolaanse oppositieleider":2.0,"dit jaar":1.0,"de Venezolaanse oppositieleider":1.0,"de prijs":1.0,"haar onvermoeibare inzet":1.0,"de democratie":1.0,"haar land":1.0,"het regime-Maduro":1.0,"het comité":1.0}},"age_hours":3.9002824644444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5036,"joy":0.024,"surprise":0.0463,"sadness":0.044,"fear":0.2248,"anger":0.0913,"disgust":0.066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to a Venezuelan opposition leader for her work promoting democracy.

In het eerste grote lijsttrekkersdebat discussiëren ze over tien onderwerpen die hoog op de politieke agenda staan. Het NOS-lijsttrekkersdebat duurt van 14.00 uur tot 16.30 uur en wordt gepresenteerd door Nynke de Zoeten en Winfried Baijens. Het debat vanmiddag is te volgen op NOS.nl en NPO Nieuws en Politiek. De tien thema's van het debat, en de deelnemers: De NOS nodigt altijd alle partijen in de Tweede Kamer uit voor het radiodebat, en dat zijn er deze keer vijftien. Volt heeft woensdag afgezegd omdat de partij niet in debat wil met Forum voor Democratie over klimaat. SP-leider Dijk neemt dit debat over en gaat met partijleider De Vos discussiëren over dit thema. Twee dagen na het Radio 1-debat volgt zondag het eerste tv-debat bij RTL met de vier grootste partijen. Een week later is er opnieuw een debat bij RTL, met de grootste zes partijen.
