Intuitively speaking, the flatter the landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be. Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure, i.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform} (identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the \\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller the (R\\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between generalization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization bounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the reparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\\'enyi Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\\'enyi Sharpness Aware Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\\%, compared against the classical SAM method.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07758","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.177265","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Qiaozhe Zhang, Jun Sun, Ruijie Zhang, Yingzhuang Liu","raw_content_length":1918,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["\\textit{R\\'enyi"],"persons":["Hessian","minima"],"locations":["R\\'enyi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1917,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sharpness","Renyi","A Novel Sharpness","Generalization","the generalization","arXiv251007758v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the loss minima","a common measure","neural networks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sharpness":3.0,"Renyi":2.0,"A Novel Sharpness":2.0,"Generalization":2.0,"the generalization":2.0,"arXiv251007758v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the loss minima":1.0,"a common measure":1.0,"neural networks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.770949143888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.089,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3822,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6606,"joy":0.014,"surprise":0.1255,"sadness":0.0402,"fear":0.0887,"anger":0.0241,"disgust":0.0469},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a novel sharpness measure for neural networks that correlates with generalization, potentially leading to more efficient AI models.

In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel two-stage WSAD framework.

In this work, we propose RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes.

Modern serving systems adopt stall-free scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill, reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in co-located environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08055","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.239126","language":"en","tags":["csdc","computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Gunjun Lee, Jiwon Kim, Jaiyoung Park, Younjoo Lee, Jung Ho Ahn","raw_content_length":1541,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TBT"],"persons":["laye"],"locations":["Tokens"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1540,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Tokens","Layers"," Redefining Stall","arXiv251008055v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","LLM","production","stringent service-level objectives","both time-to-first-token TTFT","throughput"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"],"hydrogen_energy":["production"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Tokens":2.0,"Layers":2.0," Redefining Stall":2.0,"arXiv251008055v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"LLM":1.0,"production":1.0,"stringent service-level objectives":1.0,"both time-to-first-token TTFT":1.0,"throughput":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7732347269444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.8709999999999996,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9284,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.0308,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0117,"anger":0.0142,"disgust":0.007},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach (layered prefill) to improve the efficiency of LLM serving, leading to reduced energy consumption.

Federated learning, as a representative distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model, FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's contribution during local updates.

The architecture consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a better representation of the minoritarian classes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08060","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.240326","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Giulio Weikmann, Gianmarco Perantoni, Lorenzo Bruzzone","raw_content_length":1858,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ResNet","Residual Neural Network"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1857,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A class","the classification","arXiv251008060v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This work","ResNet","Time Series","multispectral images","different semantical class levels","The architecture"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A class":2.0,"the classification":2.0,"arXiv251008060v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This work":1.0,"ResNet":1.0,"Time Series":1.0,"multispectral images":1.0,"different semantical class levels":1.0,"The architecture":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7732752091666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8827,"joy":0.0282,"surprise":0.0592,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new neural network architecture for classifying multispectral images, specifically applied to Amazonian forest monitoring.

Existing compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution.

However, its standard formulation often struggles with poor long-term predictive accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a localized DMD (LDMD) framework that improves prediction performance by integrating DMD's strong linear forecasting capabilities with time-domain segmentation techniques. In this framework, the temporal domain is segmented into multiple subintervals, within which snapshot matrices are constructed and localized predictions are performed. We first present the localized DMD method with predefined segmentation, and then explore an adaptive segmentation strategy to further enhance computational efficiency and prediction robustness. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis that provides the upper bound of the local and global truncation error for the proposed framework. The effectiveness of LDMD is demonstrated on four benchmark problems-Burgers', Allen-Cahn, nonlinear Schrodinger, and Maxwell's equations. Numerical results show that LDMD significantly enhances long-term predictive accuracy while preserving high computational efficiency.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08065","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.241134","language":"en","tags":["csna","computer-science","preprints","mathna","research","mathds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Qiuqi Li, Chang Liu, Yifei Yang","raw_content_length":1253,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LDMD","Temporally Adaptive Segmentation arXiv:2510.08065v1 Announce Type","DMD"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1252,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LDMD","Temporally Adaptive Segmentation","arXiv251008065v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Dynamic mode decomposition","DMD","a widely used data-driven algorithm","the future states","dynamical systems","its standard formulation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a widely used data-driven algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LDMD":2.0,"Temporally Adaptive Segmentation":2.0,"arXiv251008065v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Dynamic mode decomposition":1.0,"DMD":1.0,"a widely used data-driven algorithm":1.0,"the future states":1.0,"dynamical systems":1.0,"its standard formulation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7733028725,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9403,"joy":0.0062,"surprise":0.0203,"sadness":0.0123,"fear":0.0089,"anger":0.0068,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm (LDMD) for predicting dynamical systems, which could potentially improve the efficiency of simulations used in climate modeling or energy system optimization.

Unlike prior light-emitting diode (LED)-based LeRIS designs with diffuse emission or LiDAR-assisted schemes requiring bulky sensing modules, the proposed VCSEL-based approach exploits narrow Gaussian beams and multimode diversity to enable compact, low-power, and analytically tractable integration. We derive closed-form expressions to jointly recover user position and orientation from received signal strength using only five VCSELs, and reduce this requirement to three under specific geometric conditions by leveraging dual-mode operation. In parallel, we introduce a VCSEL-based mapping method that uses reflected signal time-of-arrival measurements to detect obstructions and guide blockage-resilient RIS beam routing. Simulation results demonstrate millimeter-level localization accuracy, robust obstacle detection, high spectral efficiency, and substantial gains in minimum user rate.

Programmable photonic interconnects offer a promising path forward: by dynamically reconfiguring the fabric, they can establish direct, high-bandwidth optical paths between communicating endpoints -- \\emph{synchronously and guided by the structure of collective operations} (e.g., AllReduce). However, realizing this vision -- \\emph{when light bends to the collective will} -- requires navigating a fundamental trade-off between reconfiguration delay and the performance gains of adaptive topologies. In this paper, we present a simple theoretical framework for adaptive photonic scale-up domains that makes this trade-off explicit and clarifies when reconfiguration is worthwhile. Along the way, we highlight a connection -- not surprising but still powerful -- between the Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition, maximum concurrent flow (a classic measure of network throughput), and the well-known $\\alpha$--$\\beta$ cost model for collectives.

However, detecting such videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_58ea230ebbb7","title":"Detecting and Mitigating Insertion Hallucination in Video","content":"arXiv:2510.08078v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Video-to-Audio generation has made remarkable strides in automatically synthesizing sound for video. However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps.

However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept, making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit, computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user base.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f63414247e04","title":"DarkHash: A Data","content":"arXiv:2510.08094v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency, deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results, they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns. Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08094","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.245991","language":"en","tags":["research","cscv","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Ziqi Zhou, Menghao Deng, Yufei Song, Hangtao Zhang, Wei Wan, Shengshan Hu, Minghui Li, Leo Yu Zhang, Dezhong Yao","raw_content_length":1714,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1713,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DarkHash","A Data","arXiv251008094v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","its superior feature learning capabilities","efficiency","deep hashing","remarkable success","large-scale image retrieval"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DarkHash":2.0,"A Data":2.0,"arXiv251008094v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"its superior feature learning capabilities":1.0,"efficiency":1.0,"deep hashing":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"large-scale image retrieval":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7734855922222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.221,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8442,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6378,"joy":0.0221,"surprise":0.0576,"sadness":0.0285,"fear":0.1703,"anger":0.0417,"disgust":0.0419},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing, called DarkHash.

For this purpose, a multi-product, multi-echelon, multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model has been formulated. The objective is to minimize the cost of the entire circular supply chain starting from the collection of post-consumer plastic waste to the production of virgin-equivalent high value polymers, satisfying a large number of constraints from collection quota to the quality of the feedstock. The framework aims to support the strategic planning of future circular supply chains by determining the optimal number, locations and sizes of various types of facilities as well as the amounts of materials to be transported between the nodes of the supply chain network over a specified period.

The economic potential and infrastructure requirements are evaluated, and it has been found that from a solely economic perspective, the current status of the value chain is not competitive with fossil-based feedstock or incineration.

We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400 %. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language consistency between their reasoning and final output.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08098","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.247167","language":"en","tags":["cscl","computer-science","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Sherzod Hakimov, Roland Bernard, Tim Leiber, Karl Osswald, Kristina Richert, Ruilin Yang, Raffaella Bernardi, David Schlangen","raw_content_length":1387,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1386,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Negotiation","The Price","Thought","A Multilingual Analysis","Reasoning","Performance","Cost","Large Language Models","arXiv251008098v1 Announce Type","new Abstract"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Negotiation":3.0,"The Price":2.0,"Thought":2.0,"A Multilingual Analysis":2.0,"Reasoning":2.0,"Performance":2.0,"Cost":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251008098v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7735325872222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7678,"joy":0.0551,"surprise":0.0606,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0644,"anger":0.0381,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the impact of reasoning on LLM negotiation abilities, finding that enabling reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4% while increasing its cost by nearly 400%.

However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental models necessary for this collaboration.

However, expert sonographers are severely scarce in resource-limited regions. Here, we develop an autonomous lightweight ultrasound robot comprising an AI agent that integrates multi-modal perception with memory attention for localization of unseen target structures, and a 588-gram 6-degrees-of-freedom cable-driven robot.

However, it remains unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data, which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and (ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to intelligently decide when to learn from others.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08113","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.250402","language":"en","tags":["csma","computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Daniel Jarne Ornia, Joel Dyer, Nicholas Bishop, Anisoara Calinescu, Michael Wooldridge","raw_content_length":1541,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bayesian Decision"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1540,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bayesian Decision","Experts","Announce Type","new Abstract","Complex learning agents","existing experts","human operators","previously trained agents","learners","certain forms"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["previously trained agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bayesian Decision":2.0,"Experts":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Complex learning agents":1.0,"existing experts":1.0,"human operators":1.0,"previously trained agents":1.0,"learners":1.0,"certain forms":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7736528552777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.492,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3016,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.913,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0384,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0126,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0094},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for Bayesian decision-making to incorporate expert data in multi-armed bandit problems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a5e431c67f3d","title":"Can Risk","content":"arXiv:2510.08114v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models (LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems, understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment. This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs, examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability.

Deep learning (DL) based segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload. Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation. However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing. We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08116","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.251326","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","cscv","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Eirik A. {\\O}stmo, Kristoffer K.

These algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits. Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08117","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.251887","language":"en","tags":["mathit","statml","computer-science","preprints","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Fr\\'ed\\'eric Zheng, Yassir Jedra, Alexandre Proutiere","raw_content_length":1271,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1270,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008117v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the problem","a high-dimensional matrix","linear measurements","a focus","optimal rank-adaptive algorithms","These algorithms","the matrix","its singular values"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["optimal rank-adaptive algorithms","These algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008117v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"a high-dimensional matrix":1.0,"linear measurements":1.0,"a focus":1.0,"optimal rank-adaptive algorithms":1.0,"These algorithms":1.0,"the matrix":1.0,"its singular values":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7736990324999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9172,"joy":0.0203,"surprise":0.0298,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0073,"anger":0.014,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for matrix estimation, which could potentially be applied to various fields, including climate modeling and resource management.

In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge.

We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks.

Many temporal graph problems turn out to be much more difficult than their static counterparts. One such problem is \\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} (also known as \\textsc{MinTimeline$_\\infty$}), a temporal analogue to the classical \\textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. In this problem, one is given a temporal graph $\\mathcal{G}$ and two integers $k$ and $\\ell$, and the goal is to cover each edge of each snapshot by selecting for each vertex at most $k$ activity intervals of length at most $\\ell$ each. Here, an edge $uv$ in the $i$th snapshot is covered, if an activity interval of $u$ or $v$ is active at time $i$. In this work, we continue the algorithmic study of \\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} and introduce the \\textsc{Timeline Dominating Set} problem where we want to dominate all vertices in each snapshot by the selected activity intervals. We analyze both problems from a classical and parameterized point of view and also consider partial problem versions, where the goal is to cover (dominate) at least $t$ edges (vertices) of the snapshots. With respect to the parameterized complexity, we consider the temporal graph parameters vertex-interval-membership-width $(vimw)$ and interval-membership-width $(imw)$. We show that all considered problems admit FPT-algorithms when parameterized by $vimw + k+\\ell$. This provides a smaller parameter combination than the ones used for previously known FPT-algorithms for \\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}. Surprisingly, for $imw+ k+\\ell$, \\textsc{Timeline Dominating Set} turns out to be easier than \\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}, by also admitting an FPT-algorithm, whereas the vertex cover version is NP-hard even if $imw+\\, k+\\ell$ is constant. We also consider parameterization by combinations of $n$, the vertex set size, with $k$ or $\\ell$ and parameterization by $t$.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08124","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.254292","language":"en","tags":["csds","computer-science","preprints","cscc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":292,"author":"Anton Herrmann, Christian Komusiewicz, Nils Morawietz, Frank Sommer","raw_content_length":1966,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.46,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dominating Set","Dominating Set arXiv:2510.08124v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","Vertex Cover"],"persons":[],"locations":["Temporal Graphs"],"monetary":["$u$ or","uv$"]},"char_count":1963,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Vertex Cover","Timeline Problems","Temporal Graphs","vs Dominating Set","arXiv251008124v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A temporal graph","a finite sequence","graphs","snapshots"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Vertex Cover":3.0,"Timeline Problems":2.0,"Temporal Graphs":2.0,"vs Dominating Set":2.0,"arXiv251008124v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A temporal graph":1.0,"a finite sequence":1.0,"graphs":1.0,"snapshots":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7738576738888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.262,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9476,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8576,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0455,"sadness":0.0218,"fear":0.0228,"anger":0.0242,"disgust":0.0244},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical algorithmic research on temporal graphs, specifically focusing on the Timeline Vertex Cover and Timeline Dominating Set problems.

This paper develops a variational and spectral framework for Poisson energy-based floorplanning and placement in physical design. We show that the Poisson energy, defined via a Neumann Poisson equation, is exactly the squared H^{-1} Sobolev norm of the density residual, providing a functional-analytic interpretation of the classical electrostatic analogy. Through spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the energy acts as an intrinsic low-pass filter, suppressing high-frequency fluctuations while enforcing large-scale uniformity. Under a mild low-frequency dominance assumption, we establish a quantitative linear lower bound relating the Poisson energy to the geometric overlap area, thereby justifying its use as a smooth surrogate for the hard nonoverlap constraint.

Our task is to compute, given a probabilistic word, what is the probability that a word drawn according to the distribution belongs to L. This problem generalizes the problem of counting how many words of length n belong to L, or of counting how many completions of a partial word belong to L. We show that this problem is in polynomial time for unambiguous context-free languages (uCFLs), but can be #P-hard already for unions of two linear uCFLs. More generally, we show that the problem is in polynomial time for so-called poly-slicewise-unambiguous languages, where given a length n we can tractably compute an uCFL for the words of length n in the language. This class includes some inherently ambiguous languages, and implies the tractability of bounded CFLs and of languages recognized by unambiguous polynomial-time counter automata; but we show that the problem can be #P-hard for nondeterministic counter automata, even for Parikh automata with a single counter. We then introduce classes of circuits from knowledge compilation which we use for tractable counting, and show that this covers the tractability of poly-slicewise-unambiguous languages and of some CFLs that are not poly-slicewise-unambiguous. Extending these circuits with negation further allows us to show tractability for the language of primitive words, and for the language of concatenations of two palindromes. We finally show the conditional undecidability of the meta-problem that asks, given a CFG, whether the probabilistic membership problem for that CFG is tractable or #P-hard.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08127","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.255135","language":"en","tags":["research","csfl","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Antoine Amarilli, Mika\\\"el Monet, Paul Rapha\\\"el, Sylvain Salvati","raw_content_length":1820,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Complexity of Language Membership for Probabilistic Words arXiv:2510.08127v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1817,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Complexity","Language Membership","Probabilistic Words","arXiv251008127v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the membership problem","context-free languages","CFLs","probabilistic words","each position"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Complexity":2.0,"Language Membership":2.0,"Probabilistic Words":2.0,"arXiv251008127v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the membership problem":1.0,"context-free languages":1.0,"CFLs":1.0,"probabilistic words":1.0,"each position":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7738888905555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.076,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5848,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8573,"joy":0.0229,"surprise":0.0805,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0106,"anger":0.0188,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the computational complexity of determining language membership for probabilistic words.

We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular (EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering (targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD) analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB). Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96% classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces. This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26058","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.531288","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","csne","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Hossein Enshaei, Pariya Jebreili, Sayed Mahmoud Sakhaei","raw_content_length":1700,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EOG","EMG","SNR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1699,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","Electroencephalogram EEG artifact detection","real-world settings","significant challenges","computational inefficiency","multi-channel methods","poor robustness","simultaneous noise","trade-offs","accuracy"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"Electroencephalogram EEG artifact detection":1.0,"real-world settings":1.0,"significant challenges":1.0,"computational inefficiency":1.0,"multi-channel methods":1.0,"poor robustness":1.0,"simultaneous noise":1.0,"trade-offs":1.0,"accuracy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7829993227777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.75,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.25,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8752,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.0497,"sadness":0.0156,"fear":0.0209,"anger":0.0195,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for EEG artifact detection, achieving 99% accuracy at low SNRs and >90% in moderate noise, with significantly faster training times.

However, they often retain irrelevant information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information.

In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads, validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding.

Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1) stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy, exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE regularizers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08141","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.258121","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Chen Wang, Zhaochun Li, Jionghao Bai, Yuzhi Zhang, Shisheng Cui, Zhou Zhao, Yue Wang","raw_content_length":1487,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GRPO","RFT","Group Relative Policy Optimization"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1486,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization","Entropy","Reinforcement Finetuning","arXiv251008141v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","RFT","the reasoning capabilities","large language models","LLM","GRPO"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization":2.0,"Entropy":2.0,"Reinforcement Finetuning":2.0,"arXiv251008141v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"RFT":1.0,"the reasoning capabilities":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLM":1.0,"GRPO":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7739927822222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.742,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7602,"joy":0.0114,"surprise":0.027,"sadness":0.1089,"fear":0.0214,"anger":0.0334,"disgust":0.0376},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm (AEPO) to improve reinforcement finetuning of large language models, addressing the issue of entropy collapse.

Existing studies, however, are largely confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model.

This approach plays a vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents. Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets.

While distributed UMDA methods address privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical, leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising 18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts.

Despite their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item generation, and call purpose identification.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step. By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset, comprising 14K high-quality editing examples.

We address this challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with \"Focus\" keywords that identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios.

Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when combined with effective background subtraction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08160","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.262135","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Nabeel Nisar Bhat, Maksim Karnaukh, Jakob Struye, Rafael Berkvens, Jeroen Famaey","raw_content_length":1158,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COTS"],"persons":["mmWave Wi-Fi"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1157,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sub-6 GHz","arXiv251008160v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Person identification","a vital role","human-computer interaction","Recent research","the feasibility","Wi-Fi signals"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Recent research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sub-6 GHz":2.0,"arXiv251008160v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Person identification":1.0,"a vital role":1.0,"human-computer interaction":1.0,"Recent research":1.0,"the feasibility":1.0,"Wi-Fi signals":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7741435019444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9001,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8313,"joy":0.0266,"surprise":0.0226,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0716,"anger":0.0249,"disgust":0.0189},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a comparative study of mmWave and sub-6 GHz Wi-Fi for person identification.

Some strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average.

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels.

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic, bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features, enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex sequence generation.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8592a8488cee","title":"Long","content":"arXiv:2510.08177v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes. Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing (MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks, spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08177","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.265600","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Jiaan Luo, Feng Hong, Qiang Hu, Xiaofeng Cao, Feng Liu, Jiangchao Yao","raw_content_length":1333,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Model Rebalancing"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1332,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251008177v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Long-tailed recognition","deep learning","the downstream finetuning","foundation models","the skew class distribution","the model generalization","the tail classes","the promise"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Long-tailed recognition","deep learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251008177v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Long-tailed recognition":1.0,"deep learning":1.0,"the downstream finetuning":1.0,"foundation models":1.0,"the skew class distribution":1.0,"the model generalization":1.0,"the tail classes":1.0,"the promise":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774278292777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.4165,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4833,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8949,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0462,"sadness":0.0103,"fear":0.0091,"anger":0.0144,"disgust":0.0142},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel model rebalancing framework (MORE) to improve generalization in long-tailed recognition tasks.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9aacf621bb9c","title":"Robust Canonicalization through Bootstrapped Data Re","content":"arXiv:2510.08178v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost. Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately, real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization baselines while performing on par with augmentation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08178","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:18.265989","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","cscv","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Johann Schmidt, Sebastian Stober","raw_content_length":1224,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Robust Canonicalization","Bootstrapped Data Re"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1223,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robust Canonicalization","Bootstrapped Data","which","arXiv251008178v1 Announce Type","insect","bird identification","sensitivity","subtle visual cues","spatial transformations","A key challenge"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robust Canonicalization":2.0,"Bootstrapped Data":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251008178v1 Announce Type":1.0,"insect":1.0,"bird identification":1.0,"sensitivity":1.0,"subtle visual cues":1.0,"spatial transformations":1.0,"A key challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7742934158333337,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.929,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0288,"sadness":0.0041,"fear":0.0149,"anger":0.0096,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a bootstrapping algorithm for improving fine-grained visual classification, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by improving the accuracy of identifying species in biodiversity monitoring.
