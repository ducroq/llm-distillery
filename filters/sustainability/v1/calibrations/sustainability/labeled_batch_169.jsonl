The framework of smoothed analysis, first introduced by Spielman and Teng (JACM '04) for this purpose, defines the smoothed complexity of solving a linear program with $d$ variables and $n$ constraints as the expected running time when Gaussian noise of variance $\\sigma^2$ is added to the LP data. We prove that the smoothed complexity of the simplex method is $O(\\sigma^{-3/2} d^{13/4}\\log^{7/4} n)$, improving the dependence on $1/\\sigma$ compared to the previous bound of $O(\\sigma^{-2} d^2\\sqrt{\\log n})$. We accomplish this through a new analysis of the \\emph{shadow bound}, key to earlier analyses as well. Illustrating the power of our new method, we use our method to prove a nearly tight upper bound on the smoothed complexity of two-dimensional polygons. We also establish the first non-trivial lower bound on the smoothed complexity of the simplex method, proving that the \\emph{shadow vertex simplex method} requires at least $\\Omega \\Big(\\min \\big(\\sigma^{-1/2} d^{-1/2}\\log^{-1/4} d,2^d \\big) \\Big)$ pivot steps with high probability. A key part of our analysis is a new variation on the extended formulation for the regular $2^k$-gon. We end with a numerical experiment that suggests this analysis could be further improved.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11860","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.486247","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csds","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Sophie Huiberts, Yin Tat Lee, Xinzhi Zhang","raw_content_length":1476,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Simplex Method arXiv:2211.11860v3 Announce Type","Spielman and Teng (JACM '","linear"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":["1/\\sigma$","$\\sigma^2$"]},"char_count":1473,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Upper","Lower Bounds","the Smoothed Complexity","the Simplex Method","arXiv221111860v3 Announce Type","Abstract","The simplex method","linear programming","practice","its performance"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["linear programming"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Upper":2.0,"Lower Bounds":2.0,"the Smoothed Complexity":2.0,"the Simplex Method":2.0,"arXiv221111860v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The simplex method":1.0,"linear programming":1.0,"practice":1.0,"its performance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745135783888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.589,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7178,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8856,"joy":0.0476,"surprise":0.0398,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0074,"anger":0.0092,"disgust":0.0051},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on improving the theoretical efficiency of the simplex method, a linear programming algorithm.

Existing defenses mainly focus on protecting the training phase of FL such that the learnt global model is poison free. However, these defenses often achieve limited effectiveness when the clients' local training data is highly non-iid or the number of malicious clients is large, as confirmed in our experiments. In this work, we propose FLForensics, the first poison-forensics method for FL. FLForensics complements existing training-phase defenses. In particular, when training-phase defenses fail and a poisoned global model is deployed, FLForensics aims to trace back the malicious clients that performed the poisoning attack after a misclassified target input is identified. We theoretically show that FLForensics can accurately distinguish between benign and malicious clients under a formal definition of poisoning attack.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_dd95c76f6dce","title":"RIS","content":"arXiv:2407.08386v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are two critical technologies for next-generation networks, especially in dense indoor environments. However, existing analyses often oversimplify the indoor environment by neglecting some of the key characteristics, such as height variations, boundary effects, blockage effects, and user spatial distributions. In this paper, we develop an improved stochastic geometry-based model for RIS-assisted mmWave communications in indoor scenarios like conference centers, hospitals, and shopping malls. The proposed model incorporates the height factor for all the nodes in the network (e.g., transmitters, users, RISs, and obstacles) and captures the user clustering behavior in these scenarios. In addition, the boundary effect is also being considered for line-of-sight (LOS) probability calculation. Analytical expressions for distance distributions, LOS probabilities, and the coverage probability (CP) are derived. The CP is then validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our results reveal deployment insights by approximating and simplifying the derived CP expressions, showing how transmitter density, obstacle density, RIS density, and user cluster radius impact network coverage. Notably, we show that RISs significantly improve coverage when transmitters or transmit power are limited but offer marginal benefits when transmitter density is high. These findings provide practical guidelines for the design and deployment of RIS-assisted indoor mmWave networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08386","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.499857","language":"en","tags":["preprints","eesssy","computer-science","research","cssy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Zhi Chai, Jiajie Xu, Justin P.

We built a lexicon that links each activity to specific elements and spaces within parks present in OpenStreetMap. Using this data, we scored 23,477 parks across 35 cities worldwide based on their ability to support these activities. We found clear patterns: parks in North America focus more on physical activity, while those in Europe offer more chances to enjoy nature. Parks near city centers support health-promoting activities better than those farther out. Suburban parks in many cities lack the spaces and equipment needed for nature-based, social, and cultural activities. We also found large gaps in park quality between cities.

However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory poses challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it difficult for LLM to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are not easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLM's ability to apply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular, while LLM excels in handling natural language data, creating a structural mismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. To address these challenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent framework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The causal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tool module, the causal agent calls Python code and uses the encapsulated causal function module to align tabular data with natural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent performs reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In the memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the keys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal ability of the causal agent, we established a Causal Tabular Question Answer (CausalTQA) benchmark consisting of four levels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and causal effect level. CausalTQA consists of about 1.4K for these four levels questions. Causal agent demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems, with accuracy rates all above 80\\%. Through verification on the real-world dataset QRData, the causal agent is 6\\% higher than the original SOTA.

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios.

Yet these models are sensitive on textual prompts, posing a challenge for novice users who may not be familiar with TIS prompt writing. Existing solutions relieve this via automatic prompt expansion or generation from a user query. However, this single-turn manner suffers from limited user-centricity in terms of result interpretability and user interactivity. Thus, we propose DialPrompt, a dialogue-based TIS prompt generation model that emphasizes user experience for novice users. DialPrompt is designed to follow a multi-turn workflow, where in each round of dialogue the model guides user to express their preferences on possible optimization dimensions before generating the final TIS prompt. To achieve this, we mined 15 essential dimensions for high-quality prompts from advanced users and curated a multi-turn dataset. Through training on this dataset, DialPrompt improves user-centricity by allowing users to perceive and control the creation process of TIS prompts. Experiments indicate that DialPrompt improves significantly in user-centricity score compared with existing approaches while maintaining a competitive quality of synthesized images. In our user evaluation, DialPrompt is highly rated by 19 human reviewers (especially novices).","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12910","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.502872","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Yilun Liu, Minggui He, Feiyu Yao, Yuhe Ji, Shimin Tao, Jingzhou Du, Duan Li, Jian Gao, Li Zhang, Hao Yang, Boxing Chen, Osamu Yoshie","raw_content_length":1475,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TIS","DialPrompt"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1474,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Image","Novices","User","arXiv240812910v2","Announce Type","Abstract","The emergence","image","digital image creation","high-quality visuals"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Image":2.0,"Novices":2.0,"User":2.0,"arXiv240812910v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The emergence":1.0,"image":1.0,"digital image creation":1.0,"high-quality visuals":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745639123888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9082,"joy":0.0084,"surprise":0.0141,"sadness":0.0089,"fear":0.0325,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.0167},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach to text-to-image prompt generation, but its impact on sustainability is indirect.

The accuracy of these decisions is crucial for the widespread adoption of ADSs, as errors can have serious consequences. 3D obstacle detection, in particular, is sensitive to point cloud data (PCD) noise from various sources. However, the robustness of current 3D obstacle detection models against specification-based perturbations remains unevaluated. These perturbations are derived from the specification of LiDAR sensors and previous research on LiDAR's ability to capture objects of different colors and materials. They can manifest as very subtle sensor-based noises or obstacle-specific perturbations. Hence, we propose SORBET, a framework that tests the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in ADS against such perturbations to the PCD to evaluate their robustness. We applied SORBET to evaluate the robustness of five classic 3D obstacle detection models, including one from an industry-grade Level 4 ADS (Baidu's Apollo). Furthermore, we studied how the deviated obstacle detection results would propagate and negatively impact trajectory prediction. Our evaluation emphasizes the importance of testing 3D obstacle detection against specification-based perturbations. We find that even very subtle changes in the PCD (i.e., removing two points) may introduce a non-trivial decrease in the detection performance. Furthermore, such a negative impact will further propagate to other modules and endanger the safety of the ADS.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13653","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.503303","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Tri Minh Triet Pham, Bo Yang, Jinqiu Yang","raw_content_length":1641,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Robustness Evaluation"],"persons":["LiDAR"],"locations":["SORBET"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1640,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Robustness Evaluation","3D Obstacle Detection","Specifications","Autonomous Driving","ADSs","arXiv240813653v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Autonomous driving systems","real-time sensor data","cameras"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Robustness Evaluation":2.0,"3D Obstacle Detection":2.0,"Specifications":2.0,"Autonomous Driving":2.0,"ADSs":2.0,"arXiv240813653v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Autonomous driving systems":1.0,"real-time sensor data":1.0,"cameras":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7456547141666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.1414999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7717,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4276,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0273,"sadness":0.0319,"fear":0.4588,"anger":0.0343,"disgust":0.0146},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on evaluating the robustness of 3D obstacle detection models in autonomous driving systems.

These challenges can be addressed using generative AI. Given that GenAI based RE has not been systematically analyzed in detail, this review examines related research, focusing on trends, methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Methods: A systematic methodology for paper selection, data extraction, and feature analysis is used to comprehensively review 238 articles published from 2019 to 2025 and available from major academic databases. Results: Generative pretrained transformer models dominate current applications (67.3%), but research remains unevenly distributed across RE phases, with analysis (30.0%) and elicitation (22.1%) receiving the most attention, and management (6.8%) underexplored. Three core challenges: reproducibility (66.8%), hallucinations (63.4%), and interpretability (57.1%) form a tightly interlinked triad affecting trust and consistency. Strong correlations (35% cooccurrence) indicate these challenges must be addressed holistically. Industrial adoption remains nascent, with over 90% of studies corresponding to early stage development and only 1.3% reaching production level integration. Conclusions: Evaluation practices show maturity gaps, limited tool and dataset availability, and fragmented benchmarking approaches. Despite the transformative potential of GenAI based RE, several barriers hinder practical adoption. The strong correlations among core challenges demand specialized architectures targeting interdependencies rather than isolated solutions. The limited deployment reflects systemic bottlenecks in generalizability, data quality, and scalable evaluation methods. Successful adoption requires coordinated development across technical robustness, methodological maturity, and governance integration.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06741","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.504138","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Haowei Cheng, Jati H.

The system operator provides drivers with energy-efficient driving guidance throughout their trips and measures compliance through vehicle telematics that capture how closely drivers follow this guidance. Drivers optimize their behaviors based on personal trade-offs between travel times and emissions. To design effective incentives, the operator elicits driver preferences regarding trip urgency and willingness to eco-drive, while determining optimal budget allocations and eco-driving recommendations. Two distinct settings based on driver behavior are analyzed. When drivers report their preferences truthfully, an incentive mechanism ensuring obedience (drivers find it optimal to follow recommendations) is designed by implementing eco-driving recommendations as a Nash equilibrium. When drivers may report strategically, the mechanism is extended to be both obedient and truthful (drivers find it optimal to report truthfully). Unlike existing works that focus on congestion or routing decisions in transportation networks, our framework explicitly targets emissions reduction by incentivizing drivers. The proposed mechanism addresses both strategic behavior and network effects arising from driver interactions, without requiring the operator to reveal system parameters to the drivers. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effects of budget constraints, driver types, and strategic misreporting on equilibrium outcomes and emissions reduction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07952","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.504971","language":"en","tags":["preprints","eesssy","csgt","computer-science","mathoc","research","cssy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"M.

Yet, as observed in this paper, the proof of the difficult direction of this equivalence is unsatisfactory: It does not assign distinct roles to the two players of the game, as is natural from the definition of a zero-sum game. In retrospect, a partial resolution to this predicament was provided in another brilliant paper of von Neumann, which reduced the assignment problem to zero-sum games. However, the underlying LP is highly specialized; all entries of its objective function vector are strictly positive, the constraint vector is all ones, and the constraint matrix is 0/1. We generalize von Neumann's result along two directions, each allowing negative entries in certain parts of the LP. Our reductions make explicit the roles of the two players of the reduced game, namely their maximin strategies are to play optimal solutions to the primal and dual LPs. Furthermore, unlike previous reductions, the value of the reduced game reveals the value of the given LP.

We envision a future where Internet communication will be dominated by \"prompts\" sent to generative AI models. For this, we will need proxies that provide similar functions to HTTP proxies (e.g., caching, routing, compression) while dealing with unique challenges and opportunities of prompt-based communication. As a first step toward supporting prompt-based communication, we present LLMBridge, an LLM proxy designed for cost-conscious users, such as those in developing regions and education (e.g., students, instructors). LLMBridge supports three key optimizations: model selection (routing prompts to the most suitable model), context management (intelligently reducing the amount of context), and semantic caching (serving prompts using local models and vector databases). These optimizations introduce trade-offs between cost and quality, which applications navigate through a high-level, bidirectional interface. As case studies, we deploy LLMBridge in two cost-sensitive settings: a WhatsApp-based Q&A service and a university classroom environment.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely explored for their ability to integrate both, providing a framework for generative clustering. However, while VAEs can learn meaningful cluster representations in latent space, they often struggle to generate high-quality samples. This paper addresses this problem by introducing TreeDiffusion, a deep generative model that conditions diffusion models on learned latent hierarchical cluster representations from a VAE to obtain high-quality, cluster-specific generations. Our approach consists of two steps: first, a VAE-based clustering model learns a hierarchical latent representation of the data. Second, a cluster-aware diffusion model generates realistic images conditioned on the learned hierarchical structure. We systematically compare the generative capabilities of our approach with those of alternative conditioning strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that conditioning diffusion models on hierarchical cluster representations improves the generative performance on real-world datasets compared to other approaches. Moreover, a key strength of our method lies in its ability to generate images that are both representative and specific to each cluster, enabling more detailed visualization of the learned latent structure. Our approach addresses the generative limitations of VAE-based clustering approaches by leveraging their learned structure, thereby advancing the field of generative clustering.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16910","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.506820","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Jorge da Silva Gon\\c{c}alves, Laura Manduchi, Moritz Vandenhirtz, Julia E.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a3beaacd4b7c","title":"Retrieval","content":"arXiv:2410.22954v5 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective approach to enhance the factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs) by retrieving information from external databases, which are typically composed of diverse sources, to supplement the limited internal knowledge of LLMs. However, the standard RAG often risks retrieving incorrect information, as it relies solely on relevance between a query and a document, overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of these sources. To address this issue, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG (RA-RAG), a new multi-source RAG framework that estimates the reliability of sources and leverages this information to prioritize highly reliable and relevant documents, ensuring more robust and accurate response generation. Specifically, RA-RAG first estimates source reliability by cross-checking information across multiple sources. It then retrieves documents from the top-$\\kappa$ reliable and relevant sources and aggregates their information using weighted majority voting (WMV), where the selective retrieval ensures scalability while not compromising the performance. Comprehensive experiments show that RA-RAG consistently outperforms baselines in scenarios with heterogeneous source reliability while scaling efficiently as the number of sources increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of RA-RAG to estimate real-world sources' reliability, highlighting its practical applicability. \\jy{Our code and data are available at \\href{https://github.com/ml-postech/RA-RAG}{RA-RAG}.}","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22954","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.507231","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Jeongyeon Hwang, Junyoung Park, Hyejin Park, Dongwoo Kim, Sangdon Park, Jungseul Ok","raw_content_length":1583,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RA-RAG","Reliability-Aware RAG","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG"],"persons":["RAG"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1582,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Retrieval","LLMs","arXiv241022954v5 Announce Type","Abstract","Retrieval-Augmented Generation","RAG","an effective approach","the factual accuracy","large language models","information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","large language models"],"hydrogen_energy":["RAG"],"renewable_energy":["RAG"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Retrieval":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv241022954v5 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation":1.0,"RAG":1.0,"an effective approach":1.0,"the factual accuracy":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745790082777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8737,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0157,"sadness":0.0212,"fear":0.0487,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.015},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel RAG framework (RA-RAG) that improves the accuracy of LLMs by considering the reliability of information sources.

We explore RLHF under a general preference framework by modeling the alignment problem as a two-player zero-sum game in a game-theoretic framework, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50% win rate against any competing policy. However, previous self-play algorithms for finding the Nash policy either diverge or only converge to a Nash policy in a modified game, even in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win rate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm, Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with general preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory. We provide theoretical analysis that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash policy in the last iterate and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of synthetic and preference optimization datasets. COMAL is simple and can be integrated with many existing methods designed for preference optimization with minimal changes, and empirically it consistently maintains above 60.2% and 56.8% win rates, when applied to Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B, against all compared algorithms under controlled evaluations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23223","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.507666","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","csgt","computer-science","cslg","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Yixin Liu, Argyris Oikonomou, Weiqiang Zheng, Yang Cai, Arman Cohan","raw_content_length":1475,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COMAL","Convergent Meta Alignment Algorithm","Nash"],"persons":[],"locations":["Nash"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1474,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["COMAL","A Convergent Meta","RLHF","arXiv241023223v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Many alignment methods","reinforcement learning","human feedback","the Bradley-Terry reward assumption","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"COMAL":2.0,"A Convergent Meta":2.0,"RLHF":2.0,"arXiv241023223v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Many alignment methods":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"human feedback":1.0,"the Bradley-Terry reward assumption":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745804970277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8993,"joy":0.0199,"surprise":0.0533,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm (COMAL) for improving language model alignment, which could indirectly support sustainability efforts by improving the accuracy and reliability of information related to climate change and environmental issues.

However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairDTD achieves optimal fairness while preserving high model utility, showcasing its effectiveness in fair representation learning for GNNs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00382","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.508872","language":"en","tags":["preprints","statml","computer-science","cslg","research","cscy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Chengyu Li, Debo Cheng, Guixian Zhang, Yi Li, Shichao Zhang","raw_content_length":1739,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fair","Graph Neural Networks"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1738,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual","GNNs","Announce Type","Abstract","Graph Neural Networks","strong performance","graph representation","various real-world applications","biased predictions","sensitive attributes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual","Graph Neural Networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fair Graph Neural Networks Via Dual":2.0,"GNNs":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Graph Neural Networks":1.0,"strong performance":1.0,"graph representation":1.0,"various real-world applications":1.0,"biased predictions":1.0,"sensitive attributes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7458471336111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9216,"joy":0.0068,"surprise":0.0327,"sadness":0.0101,"fear":0.0049,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (FairDTD) for improving fairness in Graph Neural Networks.

We investigate the complexity of this problem depending on how termination of $R$ can be established. We show that the problem is in general NP-complete for length-reducing term rewriting systems. Its complexity increases to N2ExpTime-complete (NExpTime-complete) if termination is proved using a (linear) polynomial order and to PSpace-complete for systems whose termination can be shown using a restricted class of Knuth-Bendix orders.

Unfortunately, modern application codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \\textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \\textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \\& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \\textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \\textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs.

A sparse matrix is defined as an $n\\!\\times\\!n$ matrix with $m\\!=\\!O(n)$ nonzero entries. The algorithm first computes an approximate solution in single precision with tolerance $\\varepsilon_1$, then switches to double precision to refine the solution to the required stopping tolerance $\\varepsilon_2$. Based on estimates of system matrix parameters -- computed in time which does not exceed $1\\%$ of the time needed to solve the system in double precision -- we determine the optimal value of $\\varepsilon_1$ that minimizes total computation time. This value is obtained by classifying the matrix using the $k$-nearest neighbors method on a small precomputed sample. Classification relies on a feature vector comprising: the matrix size $n$, the number of nonzeros $m$, the pseudo-diameter of the matrix sparsity graph, and the average rate of residual norm decay during the early CG iterations in single precision. We show that, in addition to the matrix condition number, the diameter of the sparsity graph influences the growth of rounding errors during iterative computations. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity of the CG -- expressed in equivalent double-precision iterations -- by more than $17\\%$ on average across the considered matrix types in a sequential setting. The resulting speedup is at most $1.5\\%$ worse than that achieved with the optimal (oracle) choice of $\\varepsilon_1$. While the impact of matrix structure on Krylov subspace method convergence is well understood, the use of the sparsity graph diameter as a predictive feature for rounding error growth in mixed-precision CG appears to be novel. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work employs graph diameter to guide precision switching in iterative linear solvers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08059","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.510526","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathna","csna","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":293,"author":"Alexander V.

Recent theories suggest that loss power laws arise from Zipf's law, a power law observed in domains like natural language. One theory suggests that language scaling laws emerge when Zipf-distributed task quanta are learned in descending order of frequency. In this paper we examine power-law scaling in AlphaZero, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using a model of language-model scaling. We find that game states in training and inference data scale with Zipf's law, which is known to arise from the tree structure of the environment, and examine the correlation between scaling-law and Zipf's-law exponents. In agreement with the quanta scaling model, we find that agents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this order scales inversely with modelling complexity. We also find that inverse scaling, the failure of models to improve with size, is correlated with unusual Zipf curves where end-game states are among the most frequent states. We show evidence that larger models shift their focus to these less-important states, sacrificing their understanding of important early-game states.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11979","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.510935","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Oren Neumann, Claudius Gros","raw_content_length":1290,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AlphaZero Neural Scaling and Zipf's Law:","AlphaZero"],"persons":["Zipf"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1289,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["AlphaZero Neural Scaling","Zipfs Law","a Tale","Board Games","Power Laws","laws","domains","Announce Type","Abstract","Neural"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["domains","Neural"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"AlphaZero Neural Scaling":2.0,"Zipfs Law":2.0,"a Tale":2.0,"Board Games":2.0,"Power Laws":2.0,"laws":2.0,"domains":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Neural":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7459221808333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8412,"joy":0.0188,"surprise":0.1024,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0056},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the relationship between neural scaling laws and Zipf's law in the context of AlphaZero.

The initial phase of these DR methods often involves converting the original high-dimensional data into a graph. In this graph, each edge represents the similarity or dissimilarity between pairs of data points. However, this graph is frequently suboptimal due to unreliable high-dimensional distances and the limited information extracted from the high-dimensional data. This problem is exacerbated as the dataset size increases. If we reduce the size of the dataset by selecting points for a specific sections of the embeddings, the clusters observed through DR are more separable since the extracted subgraphs are more reliable. In this paper, we introduce LocalMAP, a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that dynamically and locally adjusts the graph to address this challenge. By dynamically extracting subgraphs and updating the graph on-the-fly, LocalMAP is capable of identifying and separating real clusters within the data that other DR methods may overlook or combine.

The task has evolved as generative approaches have become more promising than the traditional pre-fetch and re-rank-based state-of-the-art approaches. This paper introduces citation-specific pre-training within an encoder-decoder architecture, where author-date citation tokens are masked to learn to reconstruct them to fulfill LCR. There are two variants for this pre-training. In the local context-only base scheme (CiteBART-Base), the citation token in a local context is masked to learn to predict the citation. The global version (CiteBART-Global) extends the local context with the citing paper's title and abstract to enrich the learning signal. CiteBART-Global achieves state-of-the-art performance on LCR benchmarks except for the FullTextPeerRead dataset, which is quite small to see the advantage of generative pre-training.

A practical means to protect against these attacks is to adhere to the constant-time (CT) policy. However, it is hard to write constant-time code, and even constant-time code can be turned vulnerable by mainstream compilers. So how can we verify that binary code is constant-time? The obvious answer is to use binary-level CT tools. To do so, a common approach is to use decompilers or lifters as a front-end for CT analysis tools operating on source code or IR. Unfortunately, this approach is problematic with current decompilers. To illustrate this fact, we use the recent Clangover vulnerability and other constructed examples to show that five popular decompilers eliminate CT violations, rendering them not applicable with the approach. In this paper, we develop foundations to asses whether a decompiler is fit for the Decompile-then-Analyze approach. We propose CT transparency, which states that a transformation neither eliminates nor introduces CT violations, and a general method for proving that a program transformation is CT transparent. Then, we build CT-RetDec, a CT analysis tool based on a modified version of the LLVM-based decompiler RetDec. We evaluate CT-RetDec on a benchmark of real-world vulnerabilities in binaries, and show that the modifications had significant impact on CT-RetDec's performance. As a contribution of independent interest, we found that popular tools for binary-level CT analysis rely on decompiler-like transformations before analysis. We show that two such tools employ transformations that are not CT transparent, and, consequently, that they incorrectly accept non-CT programs. While our examples are very specific and do not invalidate the general approach of these tools, we advocate that tool developers counter such potential issues by proving the transparency of such transformations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04183","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.514543","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cspl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":291,"author":"Santiago Arranz-Olmos, Gilles Barthe, Lionel Blatter, Youcef Bouzid, S\\\"oren van der Wall, Zhiyuan Zhang","raw_content_length":1970,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.455,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Clangover"],"persons":["Decompile"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1965,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Constant","Announce Type","Abstract","Cryptographic libraries","a main target","side-channel attacks","A practical means","these attacks","the constant-time CT policy","constant-time code"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a main target"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Constant":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Cryptographic libraries":1.0,"a main target":1.0,"side-channel attacks":1.0,"A practical means":1.0,"these attacks":1.0,"the constant-time CT policy":1.0,"constant-time code":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7460290219444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.6475,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6705,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8389,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0093,"sadness":0.0098,"fear":0.1068,"anger":0.0142,"disgust":0.0163},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method for verifying constant-time properties in binary code, which is crucial for securing cryptographic libraries.

Through experiments with CLIP encoders, we demonstrate that GTA-CLIP, yields an average performance improvement of 8.6% and 3.7% across 12 datasets and 3 encoders, over CLIP and transductive CLIP respectively in the zero-shot setting.

While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first evaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently multiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are often available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more plentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture model to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier predictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or expected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2) content moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image annotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1x relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4x relative to the next best competing method.

While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: existing RAG poisoning attacks are less effective under GraphRAG than conventional RAG, due to GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GragPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GragPoison employs three key strategies: (i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, (ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and (iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GragPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text) on multiple variations of GraphRAG.

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio.

If all we have access to is a Turing machine computing $r$, it is not possible to decide whether an input formula from this theory satisfiable. However, we show an algorithm to decide this problem when: 1. $r$ is known to be transcendental, or 2. $r$ is a root of some given integer polynomial (that is, $r$ is algebraic). In other words, knowing the algebraicity of $r$ suffices to circumvent undecidability. Furthermore, we establish complexity results under the proviso that $r$ enjoys what we call a polynomial root barrier. Using this notion, we show that the satisfiability problem of $\\exists\\mathbb{R}(r^{\\mathbb{Z}})$ is 1. in NEXPTIME if $r$ is a natural number, 2. in EXPSPACE if $r$ is an algebraic number, and 3. in 3EXP if $r$ belongs to a family of transcendental numbers including $\\pi$ and Euler's $e$.

While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02631","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.525814","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cslg","research","cscl","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Hanxian Huang, Sijia Chen, Jing Zhang, Jiawei Zhao, Scott Roy, Lisa Jin, Yunyang Xiong, Yangyang Shi, Lin Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Bilge Soran, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Tijmen Blankevoort, Vikas Chandra","raw_content_length":1422,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Rema"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1421,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Scaling Laws","Extremely Low","arXiv250202631v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The optimal bit-width","the best trade-off","quantized model size","accuracy","a subject","ongoing debate"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Scaling Laws":2.0,"Extremely Low":2.0,"arXiv250202631v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The optimal bit-width":1.0,"the best trade-off":1.0,"quantized model size":1.0,"accuracy":1.0,"a subject":1.0,"ongoing debate":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746208540277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.490499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8981,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8731,"joy":0.0171,"surprise":0.0153,"sadness":0.0121,"fear":0.0172,"anger":0.0423,"disgust":0.0228},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel quantization framework (ParetoQ) that improves the size-accuracy trade-off for machine learning models.

In this study, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style instantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its empirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's log-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded naive instantiation. Further, we relate MDAC to Advantage Learning by recalling that the actor's log-probability is equal to the regularized advantage function in tabular cases, and theoretically discuss when and why bounding the advantage terms is validated and beneficial. We also empirically explore effective choices for the bounding functions, and show that MDAC performs better than strong non-regularized and entropy-only-regularized methods with an appropriate choice of the bounding functions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03854","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.526631","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Ryo Iwaki","raw_content_length":1307,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Kullback-Leibler","Mirror Descent Value Iteration","Reinforcement Learning","MDAC","Bounded Advantage Learning","Mirror Descent Actor Critic"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1306,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mirror Descent Actor Critic","Bounded Advantage Learning","arXiv250203854v2","Announce Type","Abstract","Regularization","a core component","Mirror Descent Value Iteration","MDVI","both Kullback-Leibler divergence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mirror Descent Actor Critic":2.0,"Bounded Advantage Learning":2.0,"arXiv250203854v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Regularization":1.0,"a core component":1.0,"Mirror Descent Value Iteration":1.0,"MDVI":1.0,"both Kullback-Leibler divergence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7462382405555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8709,"joy":0.0238,"surprise":0.0707,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0072,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning algorithm (MDAC) and shows improved performance in continuous action domains.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_5ea7124daca2","title":"From Rational Answers to Emotional Resonance: The Role of Controllable Emotion Generation in Language Models","content":"arXiv:2502.04075v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Purpose: Emotion is a fundamental component of human communication, shaping understanding, trust, and engagement across domains such as education, healthcare, and mental health. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning and knowledge generation capabilities, they still struggle to express emotions in a consistent, controllable, and contextually appropriate manner. This limitation restricts their potential for authentic human-AI interaction. Methods: We propose a controllable emotion generation framework based on Emotion Vectors (EVs) - latent representations derived from internal activation shifts between neutral and emotion-conditioned responses. By injecting these vectors into the hidden states of pretrained LLMs during inference, our method enables fine-grained, continuous modulation of emotional tone without any additional training or architectural modification. We further provide theoretical analysis proving that EV steering enhances emotional expressivity while maintaining semantic fidelity and linguistic fluency. Results: Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that the proposed approach achieves consistent emotional alignment, stable topic adherence, and controllable affect intensity. Compared with existing prompt-based and fine-tuning-based baselines, our method demonstrates superior flexibility and generalizability.

We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05339","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.527478","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","csgr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Siyuan Chen, Yixin Chen, Jonathan Panuelos, Otman Benchekroun, Yue Chang, Eitan Grinspun, Zhecheng Wang","raw_content_length":1876,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DMD","Dynamic Mode Decomposition"],"persons":["fluid phenomena"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1871,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fast Subspace Fluid Simulation","a Temporally","arXiv250205339v2","Announce Type","Abstract","a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique","Dynamic Mode Decomposition","DMD","our approach","the strengths"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fast Subspace Fluid Simulation":2.0,"a Temporally":2.0,"arXiv250205339v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique":1.0,"Dynamic Mode Decomposition":1.0,"DMD":1.0,"our approach":1.0,"the strengths":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7462670511111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.467,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8934,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.899,"joy":0.0309,"surprise":0.0287,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.0088,"anger":0.019,"disgust":0.0099},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel fluid simulation technique that could potentially reduce energy consumption in graphics and animation by enabling faster and more efficient simulations.

In this paper, we argue for an adaptive interpretation of the HHH principle and propose a reference framework for its adaptation to diverse scenarios. We first examine the principle's foundational significance and identify ambiguities and conflicts through case studies of its dimensions. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of priority order, which provides a structured approach for balancing trade-offs among helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness. Further, we explore the interrelationships between these dimensions, demonstrating how harmlessness and helpfulness can be jointly enhanced and analyzing their interdependencies in high-risk evaluations. Building on these insights, we propose a reference framework that integrates context definition, value prioritization, risk assessment, and benchmarking standards to guide the adaptive application of the HHH principle.

Multilingual reasoning requires language models to handle logical reasoning across languages while addressing misalignment, biases, and challenges in low-resource settings. This survey provides the first in-depth review of multilingual reasoning in LMs. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of existing methods that leverage LMs for multilingual reasoning, specifically outlining the challenges, motivations, and foundational aspects of applying language models to reason across diverse languages. We provide an overview of the standard data resources used for training multilingual reasoning in LMs and the evaluation benchmarks employed to assess their multilingual capabilities. Next, we analyze various state-of-the-art methods and their performance on these benchmarks. Finally, we explore future research opportunities to improve multilingual reasoning in LMs, focusing on enhancing their ability to handle diverse languages and complex reasoning tasks.

In contrast, human cognition fluidly adapts between intuitive, heuristic (System 1) and analytical, deliberative (System 2) reasoning depending on the context. This difference between human cognitive flexibility and LLMs' reliance on a single reasoning style raises a critical question: while human fast heuristic reasoning evolved for its efficiency and adaptability, is a uniform reasoning approach truly optimal for LLMs, or does its inflexibility make them brittle and unreliable when faced with tasks demanding more agile, intuitive responses? To answer these questions, we explicitly align LLMs to these reasoning styles by curating a dataset with valid System 1 and System 2 answers, and evaluate their performance across reasoning benchmarks. Our results reveal an accuracy-efficiency trade-off: System 2-aligned models excel in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning, while System 1-aligned models perform better in commonsense reasoning tasks. To analyze the reasoning spectrum, we interpolated between the two extremes by varying the proportion of alignment data, which resulted in a monotonic change in accuracy. A mechanistic analysis of model responses shows that System 1 models employ more definitive outputs, whereas System 2 models demonstrate greater uncertainty. Building on these findings, we further combine System 1- and System 2-aligned models based on the entropy of their generations, without additional training, and obtain a dynamic model that outperforms across nearly all benchmarks. This work challenges the assumption that step-by-step reasoning is always optimal and highlights the need for adapting reasoning strategies based on task demands.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12470","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.534768","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Alireza S.

Initially, an extremely compressed reference image is obtained through a learned image encoder. Then we leverage LMMs to extract essential semantic components, including overall descriptions, object detailed description, and semantic segmentation masks. We propose a training-free Object Restoration model with Attention Guidance (ORAG) built on pre-trained ControlNet to restore object details conditioned by object-level text descriptions and semantic masks. Based on the proposed ORAG, we design a multistage semantic image decoder to progressively restore the details object by object, starting from the extremely compressed reference image, ultimately generating high-quality and high-fidelity reconstructions.

Large language models (LLMs) introduce new dimensions to these challenges through their ability to generate persuasive content at scale and reinforcing existing biases. This study investigates the bidirectional persuasion dynamics between LLMs and humans when exposed to misinformative content. We analyze human-to-LLM influence using human-stance datasets and assess LLM-to-human influence by generating LLM-based persuasive arguments. Additionally, we use a multi-agent LLM framework to analyze the spread of misinformation under persuasion among demographic-oriented LLM agents. Our findings show that demographic factors influence susceptibility to misinformation in LLMs, closely reflecting the demographic-based patterns seen in human susceptibility. We also find that, similar to human demographic groups, multi-agent LLMs exhibit echo chamber behavior.

In scalable applications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase multiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade the generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept erasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a null space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect non-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate accurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary strategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the most affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich the filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds.

Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods.

However, an unsupervised framework that combines kernels with Wasserstein distances for clustering distributional data is still lacking. We address this gap by introducing a computationally tractable framework that integrates Wasserstein metrics with kernel methods for clustering. The framework can accommodate both vectorial and distributional data, enabling applications in various domains. It comprises three components: (i) an efficient approximation of pairwise Wasserstein distances using multiple reference distributions; (ii) shifted positive definite kernel functions based on Wasserstein distances, combined with kernel principal component analysis for feature mapping; and (iii) scalable, distance-agnostic validity indices for clustering evaluation and kernel parameter optimization.

The input is a graph and the goal is to construct a clustering minimizing the number of inter-cluster edges plus the number of missing intra-cluster edges. CCL+24 introduced the cluster LP for Correlation Clustering, which they argued captures the problem much more succinctly than previous linear programming formulations. However, the cluster LP has exponential size, with a variable for every possible set of vertices in the input graph. Nevertheless, CCL+24 showed how to find a feasible solution for the cluster LP in time $O(n^{\\text{poly}(1/\\eps)})$ with objective value at most $(1+\\epsilon)$ times the value of an optimal solution for the respective Correlation Clustering instance. Furthermore, they showed how to round a solution to the cluster LP, yielding a $(1.485+\\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the Correlation Clustering problem. The main technical result of this paper is a new approach to find a feasible solution for the cluster LP with objective value at most $(1+\\epsilon)$ of the optimum in time $\\widetilde O(2^{\\text{poly}(1/\\eps)} n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. We also show how to implement the rounding within the same time bounds, thus achieving a fast $(1.485+\\eps)$-approximation algorithm for the Correlation Clustering problem. This bridges the gap between state-of-the-art methods for approximating Correlation Clustering and the recent focus on fast algorithms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20883","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.545717","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csds","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Nairen Cao, Vincent Cohen-Addad, Shi Li, Euiwoong Lee, David Rasmussen Lolck, Alantha Newman, Mikkel Thorup, Lukas Vogl, Shuyi Yan, Hanwen Zhang","raw_content_length":1589,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Correlation Cluster LP","Correlation Clustering","LP for Correlation Clustering"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["O(n^{\\text{poly}(1/\\eps)})$"]},"char_count":1584,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Correlation Cluster LP","Sublinear Time","Correlation Clustering","the number","arXiv250320883v3 Announce Type","Abstract","a fundamental and widely-studied problem","unsupervised learning and data mining","The input","a graph"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Correlation Cluster LP":2.0,"Sublinear Time":2.0,"Correlation Clustering":2.0,"the number":2.0,"arXiv250320883v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a fundamental and widely-studied problem":1.0,"unsupervised learning and data mining":1.0,"The input":1.0,"a graph":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7465143391666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.3655,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7269,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9292,"joy":0.0139,"surprise":0.0357,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.009,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm for solving the Correlation Clustering problem in sublinear time.
