We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12141","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.467269","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","q-bionc","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Sabine Muzellec, Yousif Kashef Alghetaa, Simon Kornblith, Kohitij Kar","raw_content_length":1484,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ANN","EMI","MAPS","Probing of Strategies"],"persons":["MAPS"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1483,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MAPS","Masked Attribution","arXiv251012141v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Human core object recognition","the selective use","visual information","the strategies","these choices"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MAPS":3.0,"Masked Attribution":2.0,"arXiv251012141v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Human core object recognition":1.0,"the selective use":1.0,"visual information":1.0,"the strategies":1.0,"these choices":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7445179108333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9403,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.031,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0084,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a computational tool (MAPS) for evaluating the interpretability of artificial neural networks in the context of human vision.

Schr\\\"odinger bridges generally describe transformations between two data distributions based on diffusion processes. We use a specific Schr\\\"odinger-bridge model (SM) that directly transforms low-resolution data into high-resolution data, unlike denoising diffusion probabilistic models (simply, diffusion models; DMs) that generate high-resolution data from Gaussian noise. Low-resolution and high-resolution data were obtained from separate numerical simulations with a physics-based model under common initial and boundary conditions. Compared with a DM, the SM attains comparable accuracy at one-fifth the computational cost, requiring 50 neural-network evaluations per datum for the DM and only 10 for the SM. Furthermore, high-resolution samples generated by the SM exhibit larger variance, implying superior uncertainty quantification relative to the DM. Owing to the reduced computational cost of the SM, our results suggest the feasibility of real-time ensemble micrometeorological prediction using SM-based super-resolution.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12148","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.467730","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsao-ph","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Yuki Yasuda, Ryo Onishi","raw_content_length":1250,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Probabilistic Super arXiv:2510.12148v1 Announce Type: cross"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1249,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Probabilistic Super","arXiv251012148v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This study","a neural network","the solution","a Schrodinger bridge problem","super","resolution"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Probabilistic Super":2.0,"arXiv251012148v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"a neural network":1.0,"the solution":1.0,"a Schrodinger bridge problem":1.0,"super":1.0,"resolution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744532142222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8183,"joy":0.032,"surprise":0.1088,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0115,"anger":0.0128,"disgust":0.0081},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel neural network approach for super-resolution of temperature data in urban areas, potentially enabling more efficient and accurate micrometeorological predictions.

The loss of the explored arm is observed but not counted, while the loss of the exploited arm is incurred without being observed. We propose a policy within the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) framework using Pareto perturbations. Our policy achieves (near-)optimal regret regardless of the environment, i.e., Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW): constant regret in the stochastic regime, improving upon the optimal bound of the standard MABs, and minimax optimal regret in the adversarial regime. Moreover, the practicality of our policy stems from avoiding both the convex optimization step required by the previous BOBW policy, Decoupled-Tsallis-INF (Rouyer & Seldin, 2020), and the resampling step that is typically necessary in FTPL. Consequently, it achieves substantial computational improvement, about $20$ times faster than Decoupled-Tsallis-INF, while also demonstrating better empirical performance in both regimes. Finally, we empirically show that our approach outperforms a pure exploration policy, and that naively combining a pure exploration with a standard exploitation policy is suboptimal.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12152","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.468154","language":"en","tags":["preprints","statml","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Chaiwon Kim, Jongyeong Lee, Min-hwan Oh","raw_content_length":1305,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MAB","BOBW","FTPL"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1304,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the-Perturbed-Leader","Decoupled Bandits","one arm","Announce Type","the decoupled multi-armed bandit","MAB problem","exploration","exploitation","each round","The loss"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the-Perturbed-Leader":2.0,"Decoupled Bandits":2.0,"one arm":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"the decoupled multi-armed bandit":1.0,"MAB problem":1.0,"exploration":1.0,"exploitation":1.0,"each round":1.0,"The loss":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7445485916666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7990000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8402,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8649,"joy":0.0111,"surprise":0.0459,"sadness":0.0325,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0247,"disgust":0.0146},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm for the decoupled multi-armed bandit problem, achieving computational improvements of about 20 times faster than a previous approach.

We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization (RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely, DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80% overhead reduction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12238","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.469374","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","mathoc","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Boyang Zhang, Zhiguo Wang, Ya-Feng Liu","raw_content_length":1369,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Gradient-Guided Diffusion","Optimization","CCP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1368,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Gradient Guided Diffusion Framework","Chance Constrained Programming","CCP","GGDOpt","arXiv251012238v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Chance constrained programming","a powerful framework","optimization problems"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Chance Constrained Programming"],"engineering":["Chance Constrained Programming","Chance constrained programming"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Gradient Guided Diffusion Framework":2.0,"Chance Constrained Programming":2.0,"CCP":2.0,"GGDOpt":2.0,"arXiv251012238v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Chance constrained programming":1.0,"a powerful framework":1.0,"optimization problems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744592807222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8519,"joy":0.0195,"surprise":0.0181,"sadness":0.0034,"fear":0.0676,"anger":0.0225,"disgust":0.017},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel optimization framework (GGDOpt) for chance constrained programming, demonstrating a potential 80% overhead reduction in a waveform design task.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_921385275e1f","title":"Beyond","content":"arXiv:2510.12366v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. Conventional RIS is constrained to a diagonal scattering matrix, which limits its flexibility. Recently, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a more general RIS architecture class that allows inter-element connections and shows great potential for performance improvement. Despite extensive progress on BD-RIS, most existing studies rely on simplified channel models that ignore practical electromagnetic (EM) effects such as mutual coupling and impedance mismatching. To address this gap, this paper investigates the architecture design and optimization of BD-RIS under the general physics-consistent model derived with multiport network theory in recent literature. Building on a compact reformulation of this model, we show that band-connected RIS achieves the same channel-shaping capability as fully-connected RIS, which extends existing results obtained for conventional channel models. We then develop optimization methods under the general physics-consistent model; specifically, we derive closed-form solutions for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, propose a globally optimal semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm for single-stream multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, and design an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm for multiuser MIMO systems. Using the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations to evaluate the impact of various EM effects and approximations, including mutual coupling among RIS antennas and the commonly adopted unilateral approximation, on system performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12366","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.471094","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","csit","computer-science","research","mathit","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Zheyu Wu, Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx","raw_content_length":1743,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RIS"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1742,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["BD-RIS","arXiv251012366v1 Announce Type","cross","Reconfigurable intelligent surface","RIS","a promising technology","future wireless communication systems","Conventional RIS","a diagonal scattering matrix","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"BD-RIS":2.0,"arXiv251012366v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Reconfigurable intelligent surface":1.0,"RIS":1.0,"a promising technology":1.0,"future wireless communication systems":1.0,"Conventional RIS":1.0,"a diagonal scattering matrix":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744648258333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.547,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9094,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8608,"joy":0.0323,"surprise":0.0779,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores a new architecture for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in wireless communication, aiming to improve performance by addressing limitations in conventional RIS designs.

These new workflows, e.g. in On-set Virtual Production, present the challenge of requiring precise quality control and energy efficiency. Existing approaches to transcoding often fall short of these requirements, either due to a lack of quality control or computational overhead. To fill this gap, we present a lightweight neural network (LiteVPNet) for accurately predicting Quantisation Parameters for NVENC AV1 encoders that achieve a specified VMAF score. We use low-complexity features, including bitstream characteristics, video complexity measures, and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. Our results demonstrate that LiteVPNet achieves mean VMAF errors below 1.2 points across a wide range of quality targets. Notably, LiteVPNet achieves VMAF errors within 2 points for over 87% of our test corpus, c.f. approx 61% with state-of-the-art methods.

While encoders can be configured to produce bitstreams that are decoder-friendly, estimating the decoding complexity and energy overhead for a given video is non-trivial. In this study, we systematically analyse the impact of disabling various coding tools and adjusting coding parameters in two AV1 encoders, libaom-av1 and SVT-AV1. Using system-level energy measurement tools like RAPL (Running Average Power Limit), Intel SoC Watch (integrated with VTune profiler), we quantify the resulting trade-offs between decoding complexity, energy consumption, and compression efficiency for decoding a bitstream. Our results demonstrate that specific encoder configurations can substantially reduce decoding complexity with minimal perceptual quality degradation. For libaom-av1, disabling CDEF, an in-loop filter gives us a mean reduction in decoding cycles by 10%. For SVT-AV1, using the in-built, fast-decode=2 preset achieves a more substantial 24% reduction in decoding cycles.

In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome.

However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex optimization.

Due to decoherence, the quality of the computational outcome can degrade seriously with increasing circuit length. Thus, there is major interest to reduce a quantum circuit to an equivalent circuit which is in its gate count as short as possible. One method to address efficient transpilation is based on approaches known from stochastic optimization, e.g. by using random sampling and token replacement strategies. Here, a core challenge is that these methods can suffer from sampling efficiency, causing long and energy consuming optimization time. As a remedy, we propose in this work 2D neural guided sampling. Thus, given a 2D representation of a quantum circuit, a neural network predicts groups of gates in the quantum circuit, which are likely reducible.

Specifically, we develop feedback laws for stabilization of hyperbolic systems at the micro level (i.e., of the large-scale system) that employ a) measurements obtained from the $n+m$ system (i.e., at micro level) and kernels constructed based on an $\\infty+\\infty$ continuum system counterpart (i.e., at macro level), or b) kernels and measurements both stemming from a continuum counterpart, or c) averaged-continuum kernels/measurements. We also address (d)) stabilization of the continuum (macro) system, employing continuum kernels and measurements. Towards addressing d) we derive in a constructive manner an $\\infty+\\infty$ continuum approximation of $n+m$ hyperbolic systems and establish that its solutions approximate, for large $n$ and $m$, the solutions of the $n+m$ system. We then construct a feedback law for stabilization of the $\\infty+\\infty$ system via introduction of a continuum-PDE backstepping transformation. We establish well-posedness of the resulting 4-D kernel equations and prove closed-loop stability via construction of a novel Lyapunov functional. Furthermore, under control configuration a) we establish that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable provided that $n$ and $m$ are large, by proving that the exact, stabilizing $n+m$ control kernels can be accurately approximated by the continuum kernels. While under control configurations b) and c), we establish closed-loop stability capitalizing on the established solutions' and kernels' approximation properties via employment of infinite-dimensional ISS arguments.

This has strong implications for the runtime of many distributed protocols on those graphs, which often have runtimes bounded as a function of the diameter. The GIRG model exhibits many properties empirically found in real-world networks, and the runtime of various practical algorithms has empirically been found to scale in the same way for GIRG and for real-world networks, in particular related to computing distances, diameter, clustering, cliques and chromatic numbers. Thus the GIRG model is a promising candidate for deriving insight about the performance of algorithms in real-world instances. The diameter was previously only known in the one-dimensional case, and the proof relied very heavily on dimension one. Our proof employs a similar Peierls-type argument alongside a novel renormalization scheme. Moreover, instead of using topological arguments (which become complicated in high dimensions) in establishing the connectivity of certain boundaries, we employ some comparatively recent and clearer graph-theoretic machinery. The lower bound is proven via a simple ad-hoc construction.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12543","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.476019","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cssi","computer-science","research","mathpr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Zylan Benjert, Kostas Lakis, Johannes Lengler, Raghu Raman Ravi","raw_content_length":1280,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type","Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1275,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs","The Diameter","Threshold","the runtime","arXiv251012543v1 Announce Type","cross","threshold","zero temperature","GIRG","strong implications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs":3.0,"The Diameter":2.0,"Threshold":2.0,"the runtime":2.0,"arXiv251012543v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"threshold":1.0,"zero temperature":1.0,"GIRG":1.0,"strong implications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7448325675,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9033,"joy":0.0116,"surprise":0.0385,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0081,"anger":0.0219,"disgust":0.0124},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on the diameter of Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRG), proving it is $\\Theta(\\log n)$.

A common remedy is to train a model across multiple environments; in the Waterbirds dataset, this corresponds to training by randomizing the background. However, selecting the right environments is a challenging problem, given that these are rarely known a priori. We propose Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery (UAED), a unified framework that learns a distribution over data transformations that instantiate environments, and optimizes any robust objective averaged over this learned distribution. UAED yields adaptive variants of IRM, REx, GroupDRO, and CORAL without predefined groups or manual environment design. We provide a theoretical analysis by providing PAC-Bayes bounds and by showing robustness to test environment distributions under standard conditions. Empirically, UAED discovers interpretable environment distributions and improves worst-case accuracy on standard benchmarks, while remaining competitive on mean accuracy. Our results indicate that making environments adaptive is a practical route to out-of-distribution generalization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12547","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.476775","language":"en","tags":["preprints","statml","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Madi Matymov, Ba-Hien Tran, Maurizio Filippone","raw_content_length":1293,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery arXiv:2510.12547v1","Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery","GroupDRO","UAED","PAC","Machine Learning"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1292,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery","the Waterbirds dataset","arXiv251012547v1","Announce Type","cross","An open problem","Machine Learning","models","spurious correlations","the data"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery"],"ai_ml":["Machine Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Universal Adaptive Environment Discovery":2.0,"the Waterbirds dataset":2.0,"arXiv251012547v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"An open problem":1.0,"Machine Learning":1.0,"models":1.0,"spurious correlations":1.0,"the data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.744856649722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2469999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7506,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.894,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0075,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.0321,"anger":0.0274,"disgust":0.0249},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel machine learning framework (UAED) to improve model robustness and out-of-distribution generalization.

Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12577","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.477961","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","q-biomn","physicsbio-ph","research","q-bioqm","cset","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Hasi Hays, William Richardson","raw_content_length":1964,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.36,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cardiac"],"persons":["ECM"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1963,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ECMSim","Announce Type","cross","Extracellular matrix ECM remodeling","a wide variety","healthy and diseased tissue processes","ECM","various chemical and mechanical conditions","part","its complex regulation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ECMSim":3.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Extracellular matrix ECM remodeling":1.0,"a wide variety":1.0,"healthy and diseased tissue processes":1.0,"ECM":1.0,"various chemical and mechanical conditions":1.0,"part":1.0,"its complex regulation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7448715716666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7393,"joy":0.0174,"surprise":0.1263,"sadness":0.088,"fear":0.0219,"anger":0.0034,"disgust":0.0036},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"ECMSim simulates cardiac scar tissue remodeling, a component of heart failure, using a large-scale model.

Hence, researchers require a standardized benchmark to evaluate DNA Language Models (DNA LMs) capabilities. However, evaluating DNA LMs is a complex task that intersects genomic's domain-specific challenges and machine learning methodologies, where seemingly minor implementation details can significantly compromise benchmark validity. We demonstrate this through BEND (Benchmarking DNA Language Models), where hardware-dependent hyperparameters -- number of data loading workers and buffer sizes -- create spurious performance variations of up to 4% for identical models. The problem stems from inadequate data shuffling interacting with domain specific data characteristics. Experiments with three DNA language models (HyenaDNA, DNABERT-2, ResNet-LM) show these artifacts affect both absolute performance and relative model rankings. We propose a simple solution: pre-shuffling data before storage eliminates hardware dependencies while maintaining efficiency. This work highlights how standard ML practices can interact unexpectedly with domain-specific data characteristics, with broader implications for benchmark design in specialized domains.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12617","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.478389","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cslg","research","q-biogn","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Davide Greco, Konrad Rawlik","raw_content_length":1323,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DNAB","BEND","Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1322,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Same model","better performance","the impact","DNA Language Models","DNA LMs","arXiv251012617v1 Announce Type","cross","Large Language Models","genomics","their potential"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Same model":2.0,"better performance":2.0,"the impact":2.0,"DNA Language Models":2.0,"DNA LMs":2.0,"arXiv251012617v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"genomics":1.0,"their potential":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7448858044444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9139,"joy":0.0108,"surprise":0.0454,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the benchmarking of DNA language models, which could indirectly support sustainability efforts by improving the efficiency and accuracy of genomic research related to climate change or biodiversity.

We give $L^2$ contraction criteria in two time-dependent metrics induced by the mirror Hessian, which reduce to the coercivity of certain conditional expectation operators. We then give an exact identity for the entropy production rate of the Sinkhorn flow, which was previously known only to be nonpositive. Examining this rate shows that the standard semigroup analysis of diffusion processes extends systematically to the Sinkhorn flow. We show that the flow induces a reversible Markov dynamics on the target marginal as an Onsager gradient flow.

Simulation and modeling play an important role in the design of QCA circuits because fully-coherent models of QCA scale exponentially with the number of devices, and such models are severely limited in size. For larger circuits, approximations become necessary. In the era of fault-tolerant quantum computation, however, it may become possible to model large QCA circuits without such limitations. Presently, this work explores the use of the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method for estimating the ground state of QCA circuits. This is relevant because the computational result of a QCA calculation is encoded in the circuit's ground state. In this study, VQE is used to model logic circuits, including binary wires, inverters, and majority gates. VQE models are performed ideal simulators, noisy simulators, and actual quantum hardware. This study demonstrates that VQE may indeed be used to model molecular QCA circuits. It is observed that using modern NISQ hardware, results are still quite sensitive to noise, so measures should be taken to minimize noise. These include simplifying the ansatz circuit whenever possible, and using low-noise hardware.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12656","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.480044","language":"en","tags":["preprints","eesssy","computer-science","research","cssy","quant-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Nischal Binod Gautam, Enrique P.

Our approach introduces Voronoi-type loss functions aligned with the gate-partition geometry and establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). In over-specified models, we reveal a link between the MLE's convergence rate and the solvability of an associated system of polynomial equations characterizing near-nonidentifiable directions. For model selection, we adapt dendrograms of mixing measures to SGMoE, yielding a consistent, sweep-free selector of the number of experts that attains pointwise-optimal parameter rates under overfitting while avoiding multi-size training. Simulations on synthetic data corroborate the theory, accurately recovering the expert count and achieving the predicted rates for parameter estimation while closely approximating the regression function. Under model misspecification (e.g., $\\epsilon$-contamination), the dendrogram selection criterion is robust, recovering the true number of mixture components, while the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood tend to overselect as sample size grows. On a maize proteomics dataset of drought-responsive traits, our dendrogram-guided SGMoE selects two experts, exposes a clear mixing-measure hierarchy, stabilizes the likelihood early, and yields interpretable genotype-phenotype maps, outperforming standard criteria without multi-size training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12744","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.480863","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statml","computer-science","statco","cslg","research","statme","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Do Tien Hai, Trung Nguyen Mai, TrungTin Nguyen, Nhat Ho, Binh T.

While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.481285","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","csai","computer-science","research","q-bioqm","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Saurabh Sihag, Gonzalo Mateos, Alejandro Ribeiro","raw_content_length":1841,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1840,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Neurodegeneration","Brain Age Gap Prediction Models","A Graph Signal Processing Perspective","arXiv251012763v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","the progressive loss","neuronal structure","function","clinical practice"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Brain Age Gap Prediction Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Neurodegeneration":3.0,"Brain Age Gap Prediction Models":2.0,"A Graph Signal Processing Perspective":2.0,"arXiv251012763v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the progressive loss":1.0,"neuronal structure":1.0,"function":1.0,"clinical practice":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7449860313888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7455,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0403,"sadness":0.0483,"fear":0.0564,"anger":0.0251,"disgust":0.0766},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel approach to predicting brain age gap using graph neural networks, which could potentially improve diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Although GBS has been heuristically and experimentally observed to favor sampling dense subgraphs, its theoretical performance on this classically hard problem remains largely unexplored. We focus on a natural statistic derived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS samples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this signal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background nodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS and quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal a sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured hard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal, making detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings provide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain computationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate further investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum approaches for this problem.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12774","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.481708","language":"en","tags":["cscc","preprints","mathco","computer-science","research","quant-ph","csds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Yu-Zhen Janice Chen, Laurent Massouli\\'e, Don Towsley","raw_content_length":1389,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GBS","Planted Bipartite Clique Detection arXiv:2510.12774v1 Announce"],"persons":["Gaussian Boson Sampling"],"locations":["node"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1388,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Performance","Gaussian Boson Sampling","Planted Bipartite Clique Detection","GBS","Announce Type","Gaussian Boson","Sampling","a computational advantage","the planted biclique problem","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Performance":2.0,"Gaussian Boson Sampling":2.0,"Planted Bipartite Clique Detection":2.0,"GBS":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Gaussian Boson":1.0,"Sampling":1.0,"a computational advantage":1.0,"the planted biclique problem":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7450001475,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7654,"joy":0.0646,"surprise":0.0878,"sadness":0.0123,"fear":0.0152,"anger":0.026,"disgust":0.0288},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on the limitations of Gaussian Boson Sampling for solving a specific graph problem.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_dd923d28ae04","title":"TRIP: Coercion","content":"arXiv:2202.06692v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Online voting is convenient and flexible, but amplifies the risks of voter coercion and vote buying. One promising mitigation strategy enables voters to give a coercer fake voting credentials, which silently cast votes that do not count. Current systems along these lines make problematic assumptions about credential issuance, however, such as strong trust in a registrar and/or in voter-controlled hardware, or expecting voters to interact with multiple registrars. Votegral is the first coercion-resistant voting architecture that leverages the physical security of in-person registration to address these credential-issuance challenges, amortizing the convenience costs of in-person registration by reusing credentials across successive elections. Votegral's registration component, TRIP, gives voters a kiosk in a privacy booth with which to print real and fake credentials on paper, eliminating dependence on trusted hardware in credential issuance. The voter learns and can verify in the privacy booth which credential is real, but real and fake credentials thereafter appear indistinguishable to others. Only voters actually under coercion, a hopefully-rare case, need to trust the kiosk. To achieve verifiability, each paper credential encodes an interactive zero-knowledge proof, which is sound in real credentials but unsound in fake credentials. Voters observe the difference in the order of printing steps, but need not understand the technical details. Experimental results with our prototype suggest that Votegral is practical and sufficiently scalable for real-world elections. User-visible latency of credential issuance in TRIP is at most 19.7 seconds even on resource-constrained kiosk hardware. A companion usability study indicates that TRIP's usability is competitive with other e-voting systems, and formal proofs support TRIP's combination of coercion-resistance and verifiability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06692","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.483648","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cshc","computer-science","cscr","research","cscy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Louis-Henri Merino, Simone Colombo, Rene Reyes, Alaleh Azhir, Shailesh Mishra, Pasindu Tennage, Mohammad Amin Raeisi, Haoqian Zhang, Jeff R.

In this setting, we ask that walks respect the temporal aspect by defining $\\textit{temporal walks}$ as sequences of adjacent edges whose appearing times are either strictly increasing or non-decreasing (here called non-strict), depending on the scenario. The notion of disjointness between walks is also not unique: two walks are $\\textit{vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex, and are $\\textit{temporal vertex-disjoint}$ if they do not share a vertex at the same time. Thus a $\\textit{temporal path}$ is a temporal walk where no repetition of vertices, at any time, is allowed. This is an important distinction that separates the interpretation of our results from those of previous works on the topic. In this paper we focus on various questions regarding connectivity (maximum number of disjoint paths) and robustness (minimum size of a cut) between a given pair of vertices. Such problems are related to the well-known Menger's Theorem on static graphs. We explore all possible interpretations of such problems, according to vertex and temporal vertex-disjointness, strict and non-strict temporal paths, and directed and undirected temporal graphs.

For every hereditary class of tournaments $\\mathcal T$, first-order model checking is either fixed parameter tractable or $\\textrm{AW}[*]$-hard. This dichotomy coincides with the fact that $\\mathcal T$ has either bounded or unbounded twin-width, and that the growth of $\\mathcal T$ is either at most exponential or at least factorial. From the model-theoretic point of view, we show that NIP classes of tournaments coincide with bounded twin-width. Twin-width is also characterised by three infinite families of obstructions: $\\mathcal T$ has bounded twin-width if and only if it excludes at least one tournament from each family. This generalises results of Bonnet et al.\\ on ordered graphs. The key for these results is a polynomial time algorithm that takes as input a tournament $T$ and computes a linear order $<$ on $V(T)$ such that the twin-width of the birelation $(T,<)$ is at most some function of the twin-width of $T$. Since approximating twin-width can be done in polynomial time for an ordered structure $(T,<)$, this provides a polynomial time approximation of twin-width for tournaments. Our results extend to oriented graphs with stable sets of bounded size, which may also be augmented by arbitrary binary relations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07683","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.484930","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathco","csdm","computer-science","research","cslo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Colin Geniet, St\\'ephan Thomass\\'e","raw_content_length":1377,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Twin arXiv:2207.07683v5","linear","NIP","Bonnet","Twin-width"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$<$"]},"char_count":1372,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["First Order Logic","Twin","tournaments","arXiv220707683v5 Announce Type","Abstract","the classes","tractable first-order model checking","every hereditary class","first-order model checking","either fixed parameter tractable"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"First Order Logic":2.0,"Twin":2.0,"tournaments":2.0,"arXiv220707683v5 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the classes":1.0,"tractable first-order model checking":1.0,"every hereditary class":1.0,"first-order model checking":1.0,"either fixed parameter tractable":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7450920597222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8961,"joy":0.0117,"surprise":0.0755,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0032,"anger":0.0053,"disgust":0.0026},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical advance in computer science related to first-order model checking and twin-width.

With the rise of the QUIC transport protocol, prior work has suggested the method of using QUIC connection migration to conceal the first few handshake packets using a different network path (e.g., an encrypted proxy channel). However, the use of connection migration for censorship circumvention has not been explored or validated in terms of feasibility or performance. We bridge this gap by providing a rigorous quantitative evaluation of this approach that we name QUICstep. We develop a lightweight, application-agnostic prototype of QUICstep and demonstrate that QUICstep is able to circumvent a real-world QUIC SNI censor.

We also propose using QUICstep as a tool for measuring QUIC connection migration support in the wild and show that support for connection migration is on the rise.

Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect. The most common issue types were feature requests for privacy enhancement, which were mainly reported and discussed by frequent reporters and frequent committers. But especially issues regarding privacy enhancement were also frequently reported by one-time reporters. Most of the requests were solved without opposing votes.

However, only a few focus on obtaining models for specified trade-off preferences. When solving the problem of continual learning under specific trade-offs (CLuST), state-of-the-art techniques leverage rehearsal-based learning, which requires retraining when a model corresponding to a new trade-off preference is requested. This is inefficient, since there potentially exists a significant number of different trade-offs, and a large number of models may be requested. As a response, we propose Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL), an algorithm that tackles CLuST efficiently. IBCL replaces retraining with a constant-time convex combination. Given a new task, IBCL (1) updates the knowledge base as a convex hull of model parameter distributions, and (2) generates one Pareto-optimal model per given trade-off via convex combination without additional training. That is, obtaining models corresponding to specified trade-offs via IBCL is zero-shot. Experiments whose baselines are current CLuST algorithms show that IBCL improves classification by at most 44% on average per task accuracy, and by 45% on peak per task accuracy while maintaining a near-zero to positive backward transfer, with memory overheads converging to constants. In addition, its training overhead, measured by the number of batch updates, remains constant at every task, regardless of the number of preferences requested. IBCL also improves multi-objective reinforcement learning tasks by maintaining the same Pareto front hypervolume, while significantly reducing the training cost.

Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training (AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to low-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model retraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is often necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the pre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining. Existing PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all layers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading to significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise approximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss and time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each layer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the layerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input distribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the optimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial time. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20 model and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively, compared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree polynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the GELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the proposed method, without modifying the backbone model.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10349","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.490435","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Junghyun Lee, Eunsang Lee, Young-Sik Kim, Yongwoo Lee, Joon-Woo Lee, Yongjune Kim, Jong-Seon No","raw_content_length":1853,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Optimized Layerwise Approximation","OLA","PTA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1852,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimized Layerwise Approximation","Efficient Private Inference","Fully Homomorphic Encryption","arXiv231010349v4 Announce Type","Abstract","Recent studies","the deployment","privacy-preserving deep neural networks","homomorphic encryption","private inference"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["privacy-preserving deep neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimized Layerwise Approximation":2.0,"Efficient Private Inference":2.0,"Fully Homomorphic Encryption":2.0,"arXiv231010349v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Recent studies":1.0,"the deployment":1.0,"privacy-preserving deep neural networks":1.0,"homomorphic encryption":1.0,"private inference":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7452694927777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.1125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8225,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.921,"joy":0.022,"surprise":0.0307,"sadness":0.0034,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0101,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (OLA) for optimizing private inference on homomorphic encryption, reducing inference times for ResNet models by 2.82-3.02 times compared to existing methods.

In each global training round, each client trains a local model on its own training data and then they exchange local models for aggregation. In this work, we propose SelfishAttack, a new family of attacks to DFL. In SelfishAttack, a set of selfish clients aim to achieve competitive advantages over the remaining non-selfish ones, i.e., the final learnt local models of the selfish clients are more accurate than those of the non-selfish ones. Towards this goal, the selfish clients send carefully crafted local models to each remaining non-selfish one in each global training round. We formulate finding such local models as an optimization problem and propose methods to solve it when DFL uses different aggregation rules. Theoretically, we show that our methods find the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. Empirically, we show that SelfishAttack successfully increases the accuracy gap (i.e., competitive advantage) between the final learnt local models of selfish clients and those of non-selfish ones.

To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem.

Language models like ChatGPT can not only generate code, but also explain its inner workings and in particular its correctness. This raises the question whether we can utilize ChatGPT to support formal software verification. In this paper, we take some first steps towards answering this question. More specifically, we investigate whether ChatGPT can generate loop invariants. Loop invariant generation is a core task in software verification, and the generation of valid and useful invariants would likely help formal verifiers. To provide some first evidence on this hypothesis, we ask ChatGPT to annotate 106 C programs with loop invariants. We check validity and usefulness of the generated invariants by passing them to two verifiers, Frama-C and CPAchecker. Our evaluation shows that ChatGPT is able to produce valid and useful invariants allowing Frama-C to verify tasks that it could not solve before. Based on our initial insights, we propose ways of combining ChatGPT (or large language models in general) and software verifiers, and discuss current limitations and open issues.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02433","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.491687","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","csse","cslg","research","csfl","cslo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Christian Jan{\\ss}en, Cedric Richter, Heike Wehrheim","raw_content_length":1278,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CPAchecker"],"persons":["Frama-C"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1275,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["support software verification","ChatGPT","arXiv231102433v2 Announce Type","Large language models","software engineering tasks","code generation","debugging","repair","Language models","code"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["ChatGPT","Large language models"],"engineering":["software engineering tasks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"support software verification":2.0,"ChatGPT":2.0,"arXiv231102433v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"software engineering tasks":1.0,"code generation":1.0,"debugging":1.0,"repair":1.0,"Language models":1.0,"code":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745315170277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.01,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.802,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9231,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.0376,"sadness":0.0044,"fear":0.0153,"anger":0.0063,"disgust":0.0036},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article investigates the use of ChatGPT for generating loop invariants in C programs, a core task in software verification.

The influence of discretization, relative density, and thickness of the honeycomb core on the stress state of the composite plates is investigated under two boundary conditions: rigid clamping and elastic rotational support. The first numerical experiment setup involves a constant thickness of each composite layer while varying the core relative density. The second experiment setup maintains a constant volume of the honeycomb core solid body, which causes its thickness to change as the relative density varies. Mathematical modeling is performed using the finite element method within the framework of linear elasticity, employing both three-dimensional modeling in Comsol Multiphysics and custom algorithms for solving a plane problem to analyze the stress state of the tetrachiral honeycomb-based multilayer plates. The technical process of manufacturing the composites is described, followed by laboratory tests under three-point bending conditions. Next, the diagrams showing the dependence of maximum stresses in the composite plate layers on the relative density and thickness of the honeycomb core are discussed in the first and second setups of the numerical experiments, respectively. The results demonstrate good agreement between the numerical data from the three-dimensional and plane finite element models. Furthermore, the laboratory data from the three-point bending tests qualitatively align with the numerical analysis.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04781","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.492475","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathna","csna","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"A.

However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning, they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks. Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers. Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' accuracy in decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE, with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with LACE.

A key factor in this context is queue impatience, where waiting entities alter their behavior in response to delay. While balking and reneging have been widely studied, this survey focuses on the less explored but operationally significant phenomenon of jockeying, i.e. the switching of jobs or users between queues. Although a substantial body of literature models jockeying behavior, the diversity of approaches raises questions about their practical applicability in dynamic, distributed environments such as 5G and Beyond. This chronicle reviews and classifies these studies with respect to their methodologies, modeling assumptions, and use cases, with particular emphasis on communication systems and MEC scenarios. We argue that forthcoming architectural transformations in next-generation networks will render many existing jockeying models inapplicable. By highlighting emerging paradigms such as MEC, network slicing, and network function virtualization, we identify open challenges, including state dissemination, migration cost, and stability, that undermine classical assumptions.

Despite its success in the single-agent setting, offline multi-agent RL remains a challenge, especially in competitive games. Firstly, unaware of the game structure, it is impossible to interact with the opponents and conduct a major learning paradigm, self-play, for competitive games. Secondly, real-world datasets cannot cover all the state and action space in the game, resulting in barriers to identifying Nash equilibrium (NE). To address these issues, this paper introduces OFF-FSP, the first practical model-free offline RL algorithm for competitive games. We start by simulating interactions with various opponents by adjusting the weights of the fixed dataset with importance sampling. This technique allows us to learn the best responses to different opponents and employ the Offline Self-Play learning framework. To overcome the challenge of partial coverage, we combine the single-agent offline RL method with Fictitious Self-Play (FSP) to approximate NE by constraining the approximate best responses away from out-of-distribution actions. Experiments on matrix games, extensive-form poker, and board games demonstrate that OFF-FSP achieves significantly lower exploitability than state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we validate OFF-FSP on a real-world human-robot competitive task, demonstrating its potential for solving complex, hard-to-simulate real-world problems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00841","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.495350","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","csgt","computer-science","cslg","research","csma","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Jingxiao Chen, Weiji Xie, Weinan Zhang, Yong yu, Ying Wen","raw_content_length":1633,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Offline Reinforcement Learning"],"persons":["Nash"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1632,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Offline Fictitious Self","arXiv240300841v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Offline Reinforcement Learning","policy improvement","fixed datasets","online interactions","real-world applications","efficient simulators","its success"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Offline Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Offline Fictitious Self":2.0,"arXiv240300841v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Offline Reinforcement Learning":1.0,"policy improvement":1.0,"fixed datasets":1.0,"online interactions":1.0,"real-world applications":1.0,"efficient simulators":1.0,"its success":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7454035891666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.9875,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1975,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9133,"joy":0.0086,"surprise":0.018,"sadness":0.0178,"fear":0.012,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0116},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new offline reinforcement learning algorithm (OFF-FSP) for competitive games, demonstrating lower exploitability than baselines in experiments.

In the PPA-game, agents select from available resources, and their payoffs are proportionately determined based on heterogeneous weights attributed to them. Such dynamics simulate content creators on online recommender systems like YouTube and TikTok, who compete for finite consumer attention, with content exposure reliant on inherent and distinct quality. We first conduct a game-theoretical analysis of the PPA-Game. While the PPA-Game does not always guarantee the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), we identify prevalent scenarios ensuring its existence. Simulated experiments further prove that the cases where PNE does not exist rarely happen. Beyond analyzing static payoffs, we further discuss the agents' online learning about resource payoffs by integrating a multi-player multi-armed bandit framework. We propose an online algorithm facilitating each agent's maximization of cumulative payoffs over $T$ rounds. Theoretically, we establish that the regret of any agent is bounded by $O(\\log^{1 + \\eta} T)$ for any $\\eta > 0$. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our online learning approach.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15524","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.495809","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csgt","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Renzhe Xu, Haotian Wang, Xingxuan Zhang, Bo Li, Peng Cui","raw_content_length":1340,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["YouTube","PNE","the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game","TikTok"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1339,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PPA","agents","arXiv240315524v3 Announce Type","Abstract","this paper","the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game","PPA-Game","which","situations","divisible resources"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PPA":2.0,"agents":2.0,"arXiv240315524v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"the Proportional Payoff Allocation Game":1.0,"PPA-Game":1.0,"which":1.0,"situations":1.0,"divisible resources":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745417696666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8887,"joy":0.0168,"surprise":0.0197,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0175,"anger":0.0391,"disgust":0.0138},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a game-theoretical analysis and online learning algorithm for resource allocation, specifically in the context of online recommender systems.

Previous methods employing token-level or span-level metric learning suffer from the computational burden and a large number of negative sample spans. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding for Few-shot NER with Entity-aware Contrastive Learning (MsFNER), which splits the general NER into two stages: entity-span detection and entity classification. There are 3 processes for introducing MsFNER: training, finetuning, and inference. In the training process, we train and get the best entity-span detection model and the entity classification model separately on the source domain using meta-learning, where we create a contrastive learning module to enhance entity representations for entity classification. During finetuning, we finetune the both models on the support dataset of target domain. In the inference process, for the unlabeled data, we first detect the entity-spans, then the entity-spans are jointly determined by the entity classification model and the KNN. We conduct experiments on the open FewNERD dataset and the results demonstrate the advance of MsFNER.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06970","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.496216","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Congying Liu, Gaosheng Wang, Peipei Liu, Xingyuan Wei, Hongsong Zhu","raw_content_length":1255,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NER","Contrastive Learning (MsFNER"],"persons":["Hybrid Multi-stage"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1254,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding","arXiv240406970v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Few-shot","entity recognition","new types","named entities","a few labeled examples","Previous methods","token-level or span-level metric learning"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hybrid Multi-stage Decoding":2.0,"arXiv240406970v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Few-shot":1.0,"entity recognition":1.0,"new types":1.0,"named entities":1.0,"a few labeled examples":1.0,"Previous methods":1.0,"token-level or span-level metric learning":1.0}},"age_hours":2.745433351111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.6555,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8689,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8063,"joy":0.009,"surprise":0.0247,"sadness":0.092,"fear":0.0107,"anger":0.0203,"disgust":0.037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the efficiency of few-shot named entity recognition using a hybrid multi-stage decoding approach.

Lacking funds to pay this fee, academics are scrambling to continue their research. This study systematically tabulates the number of studies, citations, publication dates, disciplines, and major topics of research using Twitter data between 2006 and 2024. While we cannot know exactly what will be lost now that Twitter data is cost-prohibitive, we can illustrate its research value during the years it was available. A search of eight databases found that between 2006 and 2024, a total of 33,306 studies were published in 8,914 venues, with 610,738 citations across 16 disciplines. Major disciplines include social science, engineering, data science, and public health. Major topics include information dissemination, tweet credibility, research methodologies, event detection, and human behavior. Twitter-based studies increased by a median of 25% annually from 2006 to 2023, but following Twitter's decision to charge for data, the number of studies dropped by 13%. Much of the 2024 research likely used data collected before the API shutdown, suggesting further decline ahead.
