{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2c292a6d0dc3","title":"Approximately Bisubmodular Regret Minimization in Billboard and Social Media Advertising","content":"arXiv:2510.09084v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In a typical \\emph{billboard advertisement} technique, a number of digital billboards are owned by an \\emph{influence provider}, and several commercial houses approach the influence provider for a specific number of views of their advertisement content on a payment basis. If the influence provider provides the demanded or more influence, then he will receive the full payment else a partial payment. In the context of an influence provider, if he provides more or less than the advertisers demanded influence, it is a loss for him. This is formalized as 'Regret', and naturally, in the context of the influence provider, the goal will be to allocate the billboard slots among the advertisers such that the total regret is minimized. In this paper, we study this problem as a discrete optimization problem and propose two solution approaches. The first one selects the billboard slots from the available ones in an incremental greedy manner, and we call this method the Budget Effective Greedy approach. In the second one, we introduce randomness in the first one, where we do it for a sample of slots instead of calculating the marginal gains of all the billboard slots. We analyze both algorithms to understand their time and space complexity. We implement them with real-life datasets and conduct a number of experiments. We observe that the randomized budget effective greedy approach takes reasonable computational time while minimizing the regret.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09084","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.674678","language":"en","tags":["csds","research","csgt","preprints","csdb","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Dildar Ali, Suman Benerjee, Yamuna Prasad","raw_content_length":1503,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Social Media Advertising arXiv:2510.09084v1"],"persons":[],"locations":["Billboard"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1502,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Approximately Bisubmodular Regret Minimization","Billboard","Social Media","Advertising","the influence provider","arXiv251009084v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","a typical emphbillboard advertisement technique","a number"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Approximately Bisubmodular Regret Minimization":2.0,"Billboard":2.0,"Social Media":2.0,"Advertising":2.0,"the influence provider":2.0,"arXiv251009084v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a typical emphbillboard advertisement technique":1.0,"a number":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7644871213888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.6165,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4767,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8285,"joy":0.0173,"surprise":0.1133,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.003,"anger":0.0226,"disgust":0.007},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes algorithms to optimize billboard advertising slot allocation.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses. In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios requiring persuasive communication.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09087","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.675524","language":"en","tags":["csai","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Zhang Zheng, Deheng Ye, Peilin Zhao, Hao Wang","raw_content_length":1145,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Stackelberg"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1144,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Follower","Social Deduction Games","SDGs","arXiv251009087v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language model LLM agents","remarkable progress","social deduction games","existing approaches","information processing"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language model LLM agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Follower":2.0,"Social Deduction Games":2.0,"SDGs":2.0,"arXiv251009087v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language model LLM agents":1.0,"remarkable progress":1.0,"social deduction games":1.0,"existing approaches":1.0,"information processing":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764519081111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.320500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8641,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8085,"joy":0.0723,"surprise":0.0798,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.0205,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for training AI agents to optimize persuasive communication in social deduction games.

Existing normal estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However, existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of the proposed components.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09088","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.675922","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Weijia Wang, Yuanzhi Su, Pei-Gen Ye, Yuan-Gen Wang, Xuequan Lu","raw_content_length":1445,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mamba","AHFF"],"persons":["Rethinking Hyper","MambaH-Fit"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1444,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["-Fit","arXiv251009088v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","MambaH-Fit","a state space modelling framework","hyper-surface fitting-based point","normal estimation","Existing normal estimation methods","modelling fine-grained geometric structures","the accuracy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["modelling fine-grained geometric structures"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"-Fit":2.0,"arXiv251009088v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"MambaH-Fit":1.0,"a state space modelling framework":1.0,"hyper-surface fitting-based point":1.0,"normal estimation":1.0,"Existing normal estimation methods":1.0,"modelling fine-grained geometric structures":1.0,"the accuracy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7645347333333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8836,"joy":0.021,"surprise":0.0521,"sadness":0.021,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new method for point cloud normal estimation, improving accuracy and robustness.

However, robust trajectory repeat navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively experiments are conducted on our mobile platform.

The usage of tool-calling and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows LLMs to process and retrieve sensitive corporate data, amplifying both their functionality and vulnerability to abuse. As LLMs increasingly interact with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate long-standing threats.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09093","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.677527","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Dennis Rall, Bernhard Bauer, Mohit Mittal, Thomas Fraunholz","raw_content_length":1509,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AI Agents for Data Exfiltration arXiv:2510.09093v1 Announce Type","Retrieval Augmented Generation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1508,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Web Search Tools","AI Agents","Data Exfiltration","arXiv251009093v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language models","complex tasks","natural language processing","dynamic workflows"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large language models","natural language processing"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"Web Search Tools":2.0,"AI Agents":2.0,"Data Exfiltration":2.0,"arXiv251009093v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"complex tasks":1.0,"natural language processing":1.0,"dynamic workflows":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7645999008333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8308,"joy":0.0084,"surprise":0.0196,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0508,"anger":0.0546,"disgust":0.0293},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper identifies vulnerabilities in AI systems that could lead to data exfiltration.

Existing parameter compression methods primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\\%. Furthermore, we propose the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further enhancing sparsity.

However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.

However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress, and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and task completion time.

In recent years, leveraging embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings. Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09097","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.679136","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Chihiro Yano, Kosuke Yamada, Hayato Tsukagoshi, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","raw_content_length":1365,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Semantic Frame Induction","Frame Embeddings","BERT","ICL","Causal Language Models arXiv:2510.09097v1 Announce Type","GPT","FrameEOL"],"persons":["Label","deep metric","causal language models"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1364,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FrameEOL","Semantic Frame Induction","Causal Language Models","arXiv251009097v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Semantic frame induction","the task","clustering frame-evoking words","the semantic frames","recent years"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FrameEOL":2.0,"Semantic Frame Induction":2.0,"Causal Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251009097v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Semantic frame induction":1.0,"the task":1.0,"clustering frame-evoking words":1.0,"the semantic frames":1.0,"recent years":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7646639391666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9008,"joy":0.0207,"surprise":0.0482,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0061,"anger":0.0129,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new method for semantic frame induction using causal language models.

To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the partial momentum by a bias correction technique.

Here, we present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG, highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness.

This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism.

Ensuring the correctness of ML libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin.

Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup).

Existing studies have proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in DPML.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09114","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.681949","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Zhi Yang, Changwu Huang, Ke Tang, Xin Yao","raw_content_length":1430,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Fairness of Privacy Protection"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1429,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Fairness","Privacy Protection","the Disparity","Group Privacy Risks","Differentially Private Machine Learning","new Abstract","significant progress","conventional fairness-aware machine learning","DPML","the fairness"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the Fairness","Differentially Private Machine Learning","conventional fairness-aware machine learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Fairness":2.0,"Privacy Protection":2.0,"the Disparity":2.0,"Group Privacy Risks":2.0,"Differentially Private Machine Learning":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"significant progress":1.0,"conventional fairness-aware machine learning":1.0,"DPML":1.0,"the fairness":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7647717752777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9123,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.017,"sadness":0.0096,"fear":0.0184,"anger":0.0221,"disgust":0.0109},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method to audit and mitigate disparity in group privacy risks within differentially private machine learning (DPML).

To address these gaps, we introduce DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation, assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval, a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts, and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent translations.

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models.

This almost immediately yields a way to compute a tree $T$ for graph $G$ that preserves all graph distances with expected $O(\\log n)$-stretch. This gives an alternative proof that obtains tight approximation bounds of the seminal result by Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar [STOC'03] matching the $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound by Bartal [FOCS'96].

PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 \\log N)$, memory requirements to $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$, representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction.

We then notice that several known complexity results for SPs also follow from general complexity classifications of infinite-domain CSPs, suggesting a fruitful application of the theory of CSPs to complexity classifications of SPs. We strengthen this evidence by using basic tools from constraint satisfaction theory to propose new complexity results of the SP for several graph classes including line graphs of multigraphs, line graphs of bipartite multigraphs, $K_k$-free perfect graphs, and classes described by forbidding finitely many induced subgraphs, such as $\\{I_4,P_4\\}$-free graphs, settling an open problem of Alvarado, Dantas, and Rautenbach (2019).

A fundamental challenge in this domain is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the model.

Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss, formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically, using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_adb321291ab6","title":"A Semantic Framework for Patient Digital Twins in Chronic Care","content":"arXiv:2510.09134v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial, behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model. Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.

In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover, our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias. Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09136","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.686713","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","csai","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Marlene Holzleitner, Stephan Leitner, Hanna Lind Jorgensen, Christoph Schmitz, Jacob Welander, Dietmar Jannach","raw_content_length":1410,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1409,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Controlled Personalization","Legacy Media Online Services","A Case Study","News Recommendation","arXiv251009136v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Personalized news recommendations","a standard feature","large news aggregation services","user engagement"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A Case Study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Controlled Personalization":2.0,"Legacy Media Online Services":2.0,"A Case Study":2.0,"News Recommendation":2.0,"arXiv251009136v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Personalized news recommendations":1.0,"a standard feature":1.0,"large news aggregation services":1.0,"user engagement":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7649457819444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.417,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8834,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8126,"joy":0.0096,"surprise":0.0318,"sadness":0.0044,"fear":0.112,"anger":0.0123,"disgust":0.0173},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes an A/B test of personalized news recommendations on a major Norwegian news website, showing increased click-through rates and reduced navigation effort.

Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities. The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test sequences.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09144","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.687503","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Clara Tomasini, Luis Riazuelo, Ana C.

Drawing on an expert workshop and a targeted survey of European modelers, we assess the promise and persistent limitations of such data in pandemic preparedness and response. We distinguish between \"first-mile\" (accessing and harmonizing data) and \"last-mile\" challenges (translating insights into actionable interventions). The expert workshop held in 2024 brought together participants from public health, academia, policymakers, and industry to reflect on lessons learned and define strategies for translating NTD insights into policy making. The survey offers evidence of the barriers faced during COVID-19 and highlights key data unavailability and underuse. Our findings reveal ongoing issues with data access, quality, and interoperability, as well as institutional and cognitive barriers to evidence-based decision-making. Around 66% of datasets suffered access problem, with data sharing reluctance for NTD being double that of traditional data (30% vs 15%). Only 10% reported they could use all the data they needed. We propose a set of recommendations: for first-mile challenges, solutions focus on technical and legal frameworks for data access.; for last-mile challenges, we recommend fusion centers, decision accelerator labs, and networks of scientific ambassadors to bridge the gap between analysis and action. Realizing the full value of NTD requires a sustained investment in institutional readiness, cross-sectoral collaboration, and a shift toward a culture of data solidarity. Grounded in the lessons of COVID-19, the article can be used to design a roadmap for using NTD to confront a broader array of public health emergencies, from climate shocks to humanitarian crises.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09145","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.687948","language":"en","tags":["cscy","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":280,"author":"Mattia Mazzoli, Irma Varela-Lasheras, Sonia Namorado, Constantino Pereira Caetano, Andreia Leite, Lisa Hermans, Niel Hens, Polen T\\\"urkmen, Kyriaki Kalimeri, Leo Ferres, Ciro Cattuto, Daniela Paolotti, Stefaan Verhulst","raw_content_length":1963,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.4,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COVID-19","NTD"],"persons":["Non arXiv:2510.09145v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1962,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251009145v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","an important test case","traditional public health data","non-traditional data","NTD","mobility traces","social media activity","data","decision-making"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251009145v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"an important test case":1.0,"traditional public health data":1.0,"non-traditional data":1.0,"NTD":1.0,"mobility traces":1.0,"social media activity":1.0,"data":1.0,"decision-making":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7649924813888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9035,"joy":0.0154,"surprise":0.0386,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0236,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0039},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses using non-traditional data (NTD) to improve public health emergency response, including climate shocks.

Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation. However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting. We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level. In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over 40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09152","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.688773","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Suming Qiu, Jing Li, Zhicheng Zhou, Junjie Huang, Linyuan Qiu, Zhijie Sun","raw_content_length":1574,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Logits Replay + MoClip"],"persons":["Top-K"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1571,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Logits Replay","MoClip","Low","Announce Type","Large language models","LLMs","a trade-off","improvements","specialized domains","the expense"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Logits Replay":2.0,"MoClip":2.0,"Low":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"a trade-off":1.0,"improvements":1.0,"specialized domains":1.0,"the expense":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7650234736111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.305999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6516,"joy":0.0072,"surprise":0.0176,"sadness":0.0263,"fear":0.0888,"anger":0.1622,"disgust":0.0463},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a method to improve the efficiency of training large language models, resulting in a 40% reduction in training cost.

Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational complexity through adaptive sequence optimization.

We present the first systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs. This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping) and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and data regime.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09159","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.690435","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","csdb","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Tianyi Chen, Mingcheng Zhu, Zhiyao Luo, Tingting Zhu","raw_content_length":1556,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CLMBR","ICU","EHRSHOT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1555,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251009159v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Electronic Health Records","EHRs","deep learning","clinical predictions","the optimal method","patient data","inconsistent evaluation practices","the first systematic benchmark"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251009159v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Electronic Health Records":1.0,"EHRs":1.0,"deep learning":1.0,"clinical predictions":1.0,"the optimal method":1.0,"patient data":1.0,"inconsistent evaluation practices":1.0,"the first systematic benchmark":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765082685277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.9505,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1901,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9066,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0318,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0224,"anger":0.0155,"disgust":0.0099},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a benchmark for comparing EHR representation methods.

On-device learning trains models directly on edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy. However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\\times$ and computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\\times$.

These LLMs are increasingly proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings, considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust patient support.

Advanced model predictive control (MPC) delivers state-of-the-art performance but requires solving an online optimization problem over a thousand times per second (1 kHz control bandwidth), with computational and memory demands scaling with PE count. Traditional MPC approaches execute the controller on the PEs, but operating system overheads create jitter and limit control bandwidth. Running MPC on dedicated on-chip controllers enables fast, deterministic control but raises concerns about area and power overhead. In this work, we tackle these challenges by proposing a hardware-software codesign of a lightweight MPC controller, based on an operator-splitting quadratic programming solver and an embedded multi-core RISC-V controller. Key innovations include pruning weak thermal couplings to reduce model memory and ahead-of-time scheduling for efficient parallel execution of sparse triangular systems arising from the optimization problem. The proposed controller achieves sub-millisecond latency when controlling 144 PEs at 500 MHz, delivering 33x lower latency and 7.9x higher energy efficiency than a single-core baseline.

While most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value. However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning. To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN) operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual, thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates, enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for RL-based recommendation.

The disturbances are assumed to be bounded, but the corresponding bounds are unknown, thus motivating the use of adaptive control strategies. A boundary control law comprising a proportional and discontinuous term is proposed, wherein the magnitude of the discontinuous relay term is adjusted via a gradient-based adaptation algorithm. Depending on how the adaptation algorithm is parameterized, the adaptive gain can be either a nondecreasing function of time (monodirectional adaptation) or it can both increase and decrease (bidirectional adaptation). The convergence and stability properties of these two solutions are investigated by Lyapunov analyses, and two distinct stability results are derived, namely, asymptotic stability for the monodirectional adaptation and globally uniformly ultimately bounded solutions for the bidirectional adaptation. The proposed algorithms are then specified to address the control problem of stabilizing a desired temperature profile in a metal beam equipped with thermoelectric boundary actuators. Experiments are conducted to investigate the real-world performance of the proposed sliding-mode-based adaptive control, with a particular focus on comparing the monodirectional and bidirectional adaptation laws.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09169","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.692520","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","eesssy","cssy","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Paul Mayr, Alessandro Pisano, Stefan Koch, Markus Reichhartinger","raw_content_length":1459,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Robust Adaptive Boundary Control of a Thermal Process with Thermoelectric Actuators: Theory"],"persons":["Lyapunov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1458,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robust Adaptive Boundary Control","a Thermal Process","Thermoelectric Actuators","Theory","Experimental Validation","arXiv251009169v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A sliding-mode-based adaptive boundary control law","a class","uncertain thermal reaction-diffusion processes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["uncertain thermal reaction-diffusion processes"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robust Adaptive Boundary Control":2.0,"a Thermal Process":2.0,"Thermoelectric Actuators":2.0,"Theory":2.0,"Experimental Validation":2.0,"arXiv251009169v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A sliding-mode-based adaptive boundary control law":1.0,"a class":1.0,"uncertain thermal reaction-diffusion processes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7651610611111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8225,"joy":0.0283,"surprise":0.0541,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0445,"anger":0.0333,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes experimental validation of a control algorithm for thermoelectric actuators used in thermal processes.

However, the high cost and scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods, while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.

However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.693347","language":"en","tags":["research","csse","csdl","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Herminio Garc\\'ia-Gonz\\'alez","raw_content_length":1446,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FAIR"],"persons":["Generating CodeMeta","CodeMeta"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1445,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Generating CodeMeta","declarative mapping rules","Announce Type","new Abstract","software","the cornerstones","research","several scientific fields","which","computer-based methodologies"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["software"],"healthcare_tech":["research"],"research_academic":["research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Generating CodeMeta":2.0,"declarative mapping rules":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"software":1.0,"the cornerstones":1.0,"research":1.0,"several scientific fields":1.0,"which":1.0,"computer-based methodologies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7651910452777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.324,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4648,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8204,"joy":0.0679,"surprise":0.0888,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0039,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0032},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a method for generating CodeMeta files, which can improve the FAIRness of research software.

While open-set detection methods aim to address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to 29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive performance in both unknown recall and known mAP.

Meanwhile, the computational burden and heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this, we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint (signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels (sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight the interpretability of GCM.

Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge. Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment. Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09181","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.695346","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Ze Peng, Jian Zhang, Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yang Gao, Yinghuan Shi","raw_content_length":1307,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["sam"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1306,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Implicit Adversariality","Catastrophic Forgetting","Deep Continual Learning","catastrophic forgetting","arXiv251009181v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Continual learning","the human-like ability","new skills","machine intelligence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Implicit Adversariality":2.0,"Catastrophic Forgetting":2.0,"Deep Continual Learning":2.0,"catastrophic forgetting":2.0,"arXiv251009181v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Continual learning":1.0,"the human-like ability":1.0,"new skills":1.0,"machine intelligence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765262204722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7045000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8591,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6096,"joy":0.0052,"surprise":0.0352,"sadness":0.0209,"fear":0.139,"anger":0.1158,"disgust":0.0743},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical understanding of catastrophic forgetting in deep learning and proposes a method (backGP) to mitigate it.

Since such interventions may carry irreversible effects, it is critical to anticipate not only potential benefits but also possible harms. This study proposes a student development agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate how students with diverse characteristics may evolve under different educational settings without administering them to real students.

Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient, trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09188","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.697304","language":"en","tags":["research","csma","preprints","csro","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Zihao Mao, Yunheng Wang, Yunting Ji, Yi Yang, Wenjie Song","raw_content_length":1451,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Decentralized Multi arXiv:2510.09188v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1450,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Decentralized Multi","arXiv251009188v1 Announce Type","Multi-robot navigation","a fundamental trade-off","global strategic foresight","local tactical agility","limited communication","Centralized methods","global optimality","high communication"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Decentralized Multi":2.0,"arXiv251009188v1 Announce Type":1.0,"Multi-robot navigation":1.0,"a fundamental trade-off":1.0,"global strategic foresight":1.0,"local tactical agility":1.0,"limited communication":1.0,"Centralized methods":1.0,"global optimality":1.0,"high communication":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7653369658333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.1614999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7677,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8477,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.024,"sadness":0.0247,"fear":0.0647,"anger":0.0253,"disgust":0.008},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a decentralized multi-robot navigation system with demonstrated improvements in success rate and efficiency in simulations and real-world experiments.

Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty. The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system, making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2bcba831ac63","title":"Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction","content":"arXiv:2510.09200v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

However, despite this shift, prompt optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09201","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.698959","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Yumin Choi, Dongki Kim, Jinheon Baek, Sung Ju Hwang","raw_content_length":1325,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MPO","the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer","Multimodal Prompt Optimization"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1324,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MLLMs","Multimodal Prompt Optimization","Multiple Modalities","text","arXiv251009201v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","LLMs","remarkable success","their multimodal expansions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MLLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MLLMs":4.0,"Multimodal Prompt Optimization":2.0,"Multiple Modalities":2.0,"text":2.0,"arXiv251009201v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"their multimodal expansions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7653958769444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8625,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8122,"joy":0.0165,"surprise":0.122,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0157,"anger":0.0205,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (MPO) for optimizing prompts in multimodal large language models.

Video-based monitoring, combined with deep learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6 dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking, standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows. Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding, drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09203","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.699392","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Huimin Liu, Jing Gao, Daria Baran, AxelX Montout, Neill W Campbell, Andrew W Dowsey","raw_content_length":1781,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cattle-CLIP","Cattle arXiv:2510.09203v1 Announce Type:","CLIP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1780,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cattle","arXiv251009203v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Cattle behaviour","a crucial indicator","an individual animal health","productivity","overall well-being","Video-based monitoring","deep learning techniques"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep learning techniques"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cattle":2.0,"arXiv251009203v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Cattle behaviour":1.0,"a crucial indicator":1.0,"an individual animal health":1.0,"productivity":1.0,"overall well-being":1.0,"Video-based monitoring":1.0,"deep learning techniques":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7654113827777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9257,"joy":0.0317,"surprise":0.0231,"sadness":0.0026,"fear":0.0045,"anger":0.0084,"disgust":0.004},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deep learning framework (Cattle-CLIP) for cattle behavior recognition, which could potentially improve animal welfare and farm management.
