We model bicycle as an oriented segment of a fixed length that is moving in the Euclidean plane so that the trajectory of the rear point is tangent to the segment at all times. The trajectories of front and back points of the segment are called bicycle tracks, and one asks if it is possible that the front track is contained in the rear track (other than when they are straight lines). Such curves are called unitracks or unicycle tracks. In 2002 D.Finn proposed a construction of unitracks that are obtained as a union of a sequence of curves. Numerical evidence suggested that these curves behave expansively and that various numerical characteristics of the curves grow quickly in the sequence. In this paper we prove that the curves that form a unitrack in Finn's construction cannot remain graphs of functions, unless they are straight lines. We conclude that the horizontal amplitude of the curves has a linear growth rate between 1 and 2.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10388","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.230835","language":"en","tags":["mathds","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Ivan Molodyk","raw_content_length":1047,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Complexity of Bicycle Unitracks arXiv:2510.10388v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["Finn"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1046,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Complexity","Bicycle","Unitracks","bicycle tracks","the segment","arXiv251010388v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","the geometry","bicycle"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Complexity":2.0,"Bicycle":2.0,"Unitracks":2.0,"bicycle tracks":2.0,"the segment":2.0,"arXiv251010388v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the geometry":1.0,"bicycle":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7842162597222218,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8828,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0824,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a mathematical analysis of bicycle track geometry.

We consider Morse function-metric pairs with gradient flowlines that have nontrivial yet well-controlled cokernels (i.e., the gradient flowlines are not transversely cut out). We investigate (i) whether these nontransverse gradient flowlines can be glued to other gradient flowlines and (ii) the bifurcation of gradient flowlines after we perturb the metric to be Morse-Smale. For the former, we show that certain three-component broken flowlines with total Fredholm index 2 can be glued to a one-parameter family of flowlines of the given metric if and only if an explicit (essentially combinatorial, and straightforward to verify) criterion is satisfied. For the latter, we provide a similar combinatorial criterion of when certain 2-level broken Morse flowlines of total Fredholm index 1 glue to index 1 gradient flowlines after perturbing the metric. Our primary example is the ``upright torus,\" which has a flowline between the two index-1 critical points.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10393","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.231575","language":"en","tags":["mathgt","preprints","research","mathematics","mathsg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Ipsita Datta, Yuan Yao","raw_content_length":1135,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.83,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["0705.2074"],"persons":["Taubes","Morse"],"locations":["Hutchings","Fredholm","Morse-Smale"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1134,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Obstruction","Morse Flow Lines","arXiv251010393v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Obstruction Bundle Gluing","OBG","techniques","Hutchings","Taubes","arxiv"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Obstruction":2.0,"Morse Flow Lines":2.0,"arXiv251010393v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Obstruction Bundle Gluing":1.0,"OBG":1.0,"techniques":1.0,"Hutchings":1.0,"Taubes":1.0,"arxiv":1.0}},"age_hours":2.784245858611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0285,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2057,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8579,"joy":0.0482,"surprise":0.0674,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0066,"anger":0.0099,"disgust":0.0039},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical research on Morse theory and obstruction bundle gluing.

This model addresses the complex challenge of efficiently assigning and dispatching repair crews to minimize both downtime and the extent of outages, following the crew sequence constraints. By incorporating a realistic transportation network, our model accounts for uncertainties in repair times, repair demand at damaged nodes, and potential transportation network failures. This ensures uncertainty awareness and mitigation, providing coordinated schedules for the repair crews, assigned based on the severity of failures at each node. Our approach prioritizes components in the distribution network based on their potential for power restoration, while also considering the constraints imposed by the actual transportation network. A case study using an 8500-bus system, coupled with a real-world transportation network at the Dallas-Fort Worth area, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach, is discussed. The proposed methodology emphasizes rapid power restoration and efficient repair crew routing over an integrated transportation and power network, demonstrating results that match or outperform conventional metaheuristic solvers for classical vehicle routing problems in a deterministic instance.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10399","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.231964","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Harshal D.

As categorical dimension increases, classical category-theoretic concepts generally prove too rigid or fully break down and must be replaced by oriented versions, which allow more flexible notions of naturality and coherence. Oriented category theory provides a framework to address these issues. The main objects of study are oriented, and their conjugate antioriented, categories, which are deformations of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories where the various compositions only commute up to a coherent (anti)oriented interchange law. We give a geometric description of (anti)oriented categories as sheaves on a deformation of the simplex category $\\Delta$ in which the linear graphs are weighted by (anti)oriented cubes. To demonstrate the utility of our theory, we show that the categorical analogues of fundamental constructions in homotopy theory, such as cylinder and path objects, join and slice, and suspension and loops, are not functors of $(\\infty, \\infty)$-categories, but only of (anti)oriented categories, generalizing work of Ara, Guetta, and Maltsiniotis in the strict setting. As a main result we construct an embedding of the theory of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories into the theory of (anti)oriented categories and characterize the image, which we call (anti)oriented spaces.

More precisely, we obtain the second Kronecker limit formula of Zagier's zeta function. Using the reduction theory of Zagier, which connects Zagier's zeta function to the zeta function of real quadratic fields, we express the values of the zeta function of narrow ideal classes in real quadratic fields at natural arguments in terms of an analytic function which we call the \\emph{higher Herglotz-Zagier-Novikov function} and denote it by $\\mathscr{F}_k(x; \\alpha, \\beta)$. This function plays a central role in our study.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_910f95dae07c","title":"On extremes for Gaussian subordination","content":"arXiv:2510.10578v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper investigates extreme value theory for processes obtained by applying transformations to stationary Gaussian processes, also called subordinated Gaussian processes. The main contributions are as follows. First, we refine the method of \\cite{sly2008nonstandard} to allow the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process to decay more slowly than any polynomial rate, nearly matching Berman's condition. Second, we extend the theory to a multivariate setting, where both the subordinated process and the underlying Gaussian process may be vector-valued, and the transformation is finite-dimensional. In particular, we establish the weak convergence of a point process constructed from the subordinated Gaussian process, from which a multivariate extreme value limit theorem follows. A key observation that facilitates our analysis, and may be of independent interest, is the following: any bivariate random vector derived from the transformations of two jointly Gaussian vectors with a non-unity canonical correlation always remains extremally independent. This observation also motivates us to introduce and discuss a notion we call m-extremal-dependence, which extends the classical concept of m-dependence. Moreover, we relax the restriction to finite-dimensional transforms, extending the results to infinite-dimensional settings via an approximation argument. As an illustration, we establish a limit theorem for a multivariate moving maxima process driven by regularly varying innovations that arise from subordinated Gaussian processes with potentially long memory.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10578","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.241470","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","mathst","preprints","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Shuyang Bai, Marie-Christine D\\\"uker","raw_content_length":1630,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Gaussian","Berman"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1629,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["extremes","Gaussian subordination","Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","extreme value theory","processes","transformations","stationary Gaussian processes","subordinated Gaussian processes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"extremes":2.0,"Gaussian subordination":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"extreme value theory":1.0,"processes":1.0,"transformations":1.0,"stationary Gaussian processes":1.0,"subordinated Gaussian processes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7846017105555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1235,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2247,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8361,"joy":0.0193,"surprise":0.0154,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0444,"anger":0.0417,"disgust":0.0363},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on extreme value theory for Gaussian processes.

We prove that, while such a weak immersion is not necessary $C^1$, it generates a $C^1$ differential structure on the domain. More precisely, for any such an immersion, there is an atlas in which the first fundamental form is continuous and the transition maps are $C^1$. We prove that this $C^1$ structure is diffeomorphic to the original one. This result is the starting point of the analysis of the behavior of sequences of weak immersions with second fundamental forms uniformly bounded in the critical Sobolev space $W^{\\frac{n}{2}-1,2}$. In the second part of the paper we establish a weakly sequential closure theorem for such sequences. This analysis is motivated by the study of conformally invariant Lagrangian of immersions in dimension larger than two such as generalized Willmore energies, for instance the Graham--Reichert functional obtained in the computation of renormalized volumes of five-dimensional minimal submanifolds of the hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^{d+1}$.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10594","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.243416","language":"en","tags":["mathdg","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Dorian Martino, Tristan Rivi\\`ere","raw_content_length":1277,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Lipschitz"],"persons":["\\mathbb{R}^d$","Sobolev","n\\geq"],"locations":[],"monetary":["W^{\\frac{n}{2}-1,2}$","$C^1$","C^1$."]},"char_count":1276,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Weak immersions","second fundamental form","a critical Sobolev space","arXiv251010594v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the analysis","Lipschitz immersions","n-dimensional manifolds","mathbbRd","their second fundamental forms"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Weak immersions":2.0,"second fundamental form":2.0,"a critical Sobolev space":2.0,"arXiv251010594v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the analysis":1.0,"Lipschitz immersions":1.0,"n-dimensional manifolds":1.0,"mathbbRd":1.0,"their second fundamental forms":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7846705197222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7224999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8555,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8526,"joy":0.0197,"surprise":0.0276,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0288,"anger":0.0428,"disgust":0.0214},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical mathematical analysis related to immersions and their properties, motivated by the study of conformally invariant Lagrangians.

It is known that for any sufficiently small interfacial bonding parameter $\\gamma > 0$, the gradient remains uniformly bounded with respect to the separation distance $\\varepsilon$. In contrast, for the perfect bonding case ($\\gamma = 0$, corresponding to the perfect conductivity problem), the gradient may blow up as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$ at a rate depending on the dimension. In this work, we establish optimal pointwise gradient estimates that explicitly depend on both $\\gamma$ and $\\varepsilon$ in the regime where these parameters are small. These estimates provide a unified framework that encompasses both the previously known bounded case ($\\gamma > 0$) and the singular blow-up scenario ($\\gamma = 0$), thus furnishing a complete and continuous characterization of the gradient behavior throughout the transition in $\\gamma$. The key technical achievement is the derivation of new regularity results for elliptic equations as $\\gamma\\to0$, along with a case dichotomy based on the relative sizes of $\\gamma$ and a distance function $\\delta(x')$.

Among these, graded TPMS structures with spatially varying thickness have emerged as a potential means to further improve performance. This study proposes an optimization method of wall thickness distribution for TPMS HXs based on an effective porous media model, which allows accurate performance prediction while significantly reducing computational cost. The proposed method is applied to a gyroid two-fluid HX aiming to improve the thermal-hydraulic performance. Furthermore, full-scale numerical simulations of the optimized-thickness design show a 12.2% improvement in the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) compared to the uniform-thickness design. The improvement is primarily attributed to the optimized non-uniform wall thickness, which directs more flow toward the core ends and enhances velocity uniformity. As a result, heat transfer is enhanced at the core ends, leading to more effective use of the entire HX core and improved overall thermal performance.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10622","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.246068","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Kaito Ohtani, Hiroki Kawabe, Kentaro Yaji, Kikuo Fujita, Vikrant Aute","raw_content_length":1303,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PEC","TPMS"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1302,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Homogenization","arXiv251010622v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Triply Periodic Minimal Surface TPMS structures","growing attention","geometries","next-generation high-performance heat exchangers","HXs","their continuous flow paths","volume"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Homogenization":2.0,"arXiv251010622v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Triply Periodic Minimal Surface TPMS structures":1.0,"growing attention":1.0,"geometries":1.0,"next-generation high-performance heat exchangers":1.0,"HXs":1.0,"their continuous flow paths":1.0,"volume":1.0}},"age_hours":2.784761141111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2775,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8555,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8491,"joy":0.0617,"surprise":0.0636,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0037,"anger":0.0117,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on optimizing heat exchanger design using TPMS structures.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_1b7a909b4d9a","title":"Spectral and Dynamical Analysis of Fractional Discrete Laplacians on the Half","content":"arXiv:2510.10680v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We investigate discrete fractional Laplacians defined on the half-lattice in several dimensions, allowing possibly different fractional orders along each coordinate direction. By expressing the half-lattice operator as a boundary restriction of the full-lattice one plus a bounded correction that is relatively compact with respect to it, we show that both operators share the same essential spectrum and the same interior threshold structure. For perturbations by a decaying potential, the conjugate-operator method provides a strict Mourre estimate on any compact energy window inside the continuous spectrum, excluding threshold points. As a consequence, a localized Limiting Absorption Principle holds, ensuring the absence of singular continuous spectrum, the finiteness of eigenvalues, and weighted propagation (transport) bounds. The form-theoretic construction also extends naturally to negative fractional orders. Overall, the relative compactness of the boundary correction guarantees that the interior-energy spectral and dynamical results obtained on the full lattice remain valid on the half-lattice without modification.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10680","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.250576","language":"en","tags":["mathfa","mathsp","preprints","mathap","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Nassim Athmouni","raw_content_length":1183,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dynamical Analysis of Fractional Discrete Laplacians","Laplacians"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1182,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dynamical Analysis","Fractional Discrete Laplacians","arXiv251010680v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","discrete fractional Laplacians","the half-lattice","several dimensions","possibly different fractional orders","each coordinate direction"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dynamical Analysis":2.0,"Fractional Discrete Laplacians":2.0,"arXiv251010680v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"discrete fractional Laplacians":1.0,"the half-lattice":1.0,"several dimensions":1.0,"possibly different fractional orders":1.0,"each coordinate direction":1.0}},"age_hours":2.784925323611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8131,"joy":0.059,"surprise":0.0944,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0162,"disgust":0.0075},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research on fractional discrete Laplacians.

In recent years, there has been increased interest in studying counterparts of the Fock space and related topics in hypercomplex analysis. This chapter presents a survey exploring various aspects of the Fock space from complex to hypercomplex analysis. In particular, we discuss different Fock spaces recently introduced in the setting of slice hyperholomorphic and slice polyanalytic functions of a quaternionic variable. The connection between slice hyperholomorphic (polyanalytic) Fock spaces and the classical theory of Fueter regular and poly-Fueter regular functions is established via the Fueter mapping theorem and its polyanalytic extension. This chapter focuses on Fock spaces consisting of functions of a quaternionic variable, with a brief discussion of related works in the Clifford setting.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10688","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.251342","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathcv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Kamal Diki","raw_content_length":1151,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Bargmann-Fock space(or Fock","Hypercomplex Analysis arXiv:2510.10688v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["Fueter","Hilbert"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1150,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fock Spaces","Hypercomplex Analysis","arXiv251010688v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The Bargmann-Fock spaceor Fock space","a fundamental example","kernel Hilbert spaces","fascinating applications","multiple fields","current interest"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fock Spaces":2.0,"Hypercomplex Analysis":2.0,"arXiv251010688v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The Bargmann-Fock spaceor Fock space":1.0,"a fundamental example":1.0,"kernel Hilbert spaces":1.0,"fascinating applications":1.0,"multiple fields":1.0,"current interest":1.0}},"age_hours":2.784949238055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7526,"joy":0.0566,"surprise":0.1498,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.0167,"anger":0.0148,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on Fock spaces in hypercomplex analysis.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_1ad708f5eb5a","title":"Matrix Random Walks and the Lima Bean Law","content":"arXiv:2510.10712v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A matrix random walk is a stochastic process of the form $B_k = (I+A_1)\\cdots(I+A_k)$ where $A_j$ are independent ``step'' matrices in $\\mathrm{M}_N(\\mathbb{C})$. With the right entry-covariance, a rescaled matrix random walk converges to Brownian motion $B(t)$ on a matrix Lie group. In this paper, we study the eigenvalues of such rescaled matrix random walks, as $N\\to\\infty$ and $k\\to\\infty$. The standard Brownian motion $W(t)$ on $\\mathrm{M}_N(\\mathbb{C})$ has independent Gaussian entries at each $t$. It is bi-invariant: mutiplying on the left or right by a unitary does not change the distribution. We prove that the empirical eigenvalue distribution of any matrix random walk $B_k$ with bi-invariant steps $A_j$ and initial distribution converges (for fixed $k$ as $N\\to\\infty$) to a probability measure on $\\mathbb{C}$: the Brown measure of the free probability $\\ast$-distribution limit $b_k$ of the random walk. If the steps $A_j$ are identically distributed with normalized Hilbert--Schmidt norm $\\|A_j\\|_2 = t$, the limit law of eigenvalues is supported on a compact ``lima bean'' shaped region. We explicitly compute the limit measure and region, and characterize their phase transitions as $t$ evolves. We prove that the Brown measure of $b_k$ converges as $k\\to\\infty$, to the Brown measure of the free multiplicative Brownian motion, assuming only that the steps are bi-invariant and normalized in Hilbert--Schmidt norm. Thus the Brownian motion is the universal limit of rescaled matrix random walks, under very general assumptions on the distribution of steps.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10712","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.253401","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathpr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Bruce K.

This work investigates Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), a congestion mitigation method that adjusts power line current limits in response to meteorological conditions. Unlike traditional approaches that impose predefined time-varying limits, we propose a novel optimization framework that embeds the transient-state heat equation governing conductor temperature dynamics, enabling direct constraints on conductor temperature rather than simplified steady-state approximations. We derive a closed-form solution to the heat equation, enabling a finite-dimensional reformulation of the dynamics. We then leverage a distributed decomposition method, a bi-level Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with provable convergence, aided by regularity properties of the heat equation solution. These modeling and algorithmic innovations allow us to conduct the first large-scale evaluation of DLR using multi-period AC optimal power flow. Numerical experiments on the 2000-bus Texas grid demonstrate that DLR allows significant reduction in generation cost in congested systems over Static Line Rating (SLR) and Ambient Adjusted Ratings (AAR). The transient temperature formulation provides additional grid flexibility and headroom benefits with minimal computational overhead.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10832","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.262763","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Baptiste Rabecq, Thomas Lee, Andy Sun","raw_content_length":1540,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DLR","AC Optimal Power Flow: Transient Temperature, Decomposition"],"persons":["Dynamic Line Rating"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1539,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dynamic Line Ratings","AC Optimal Power Flow","Transient Temperature","Decomposition","arXiv251010832v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","power grids","increasing renewable penetration","rapid load growth","AI data centers"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI data centers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dynamic Line Ratings":2.0,"AC Optimal Power Flow":2.0,"Transient Temperature":2.0,"Decomposition":2.0,"arXiv251010832v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"power grids":1.0,"increasing renewable penetration":1.0,"rapid load growth":1.0,"AI data centers":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7852443697222227,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.953,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7906,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9212,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0256,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0123,"anger":0.0158,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a novel optimization framework for Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) using transient temperature modeling, which allows for increased grid capacity and reduced generation costs compared to static methods.

Interest in this question dates back to Sharkovskii's theorem for continuous maps on intervals of the real line, but it also ties to checkable conditions for Krieger's embedding theorem for symbolic dynamical systems. Given a system for which the logarithmic derivative of the Artin-Mazur zeta function is rational, we use the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem to classify for which $n$ the system has a periodic point of (not necessarily least) period $n$. Moreover, we build on work on finitely presented (FP) systems and their relationship to symbolic dynamics to classify the set of least periods, that is periodic orbit lengths, for arbitrary FP systems, extending a known classification for shifts of finite type. We also provide several constructions to realize any such least period sets.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10848","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.266579","language":"en","tags":["mathds","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Huub de Jong","raw_content_length":1001,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Krieger"],"persons":[],"locations":["Finitely"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1000,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sets","Periodic Orbit Lengths","Finitely Presented Dynamical Systems","which","arXiv251010848v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the sets","natural numbers","certain dynamical systems","a compact metric space"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["certain dynamical systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sets":2.0,"Periodic Orbit Lengths":2.0,"Finitely Presented Dynamical Systems":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251010848v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the sets":1.0,"natural numbers":1.0,"certain dynamical systems":1.0,"a compact metric space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7853102519444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9253,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0167,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0142,"anger":0.0156,"disgust":0.0129},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research on dynamical systems, specifically periodic orbits.

However, in nearly every case, the existing proofs of these results are ineffective, in that explicit values for which they hold cannot be computed. The reason for this ineffectivity is due to the reliance on the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem. In this paper, we show that any classical sifting problem with a Bombieri-Vinogradov style error term can in fact be made effective, with no loss to the asymptotic form of the original (ineffective) result. This is done by carefully modifying the sieve upper and lower bounds as to avoid the usual complications regarding the existence of a Siegel zero. We also provide some simple applications. For example, we show that one may effectively bound the number of primes $p\\leq x$ such that $p+2$ is also prime by \\begin{equation*} (4+o(1))C_2\\frac{x}{(\\log x)^2}, \\end{equation*} where \\begin{equation*} C_2=2\\prod_{p>2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\\right) \\end{equation*} is the twin-prime constant.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10853","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.267350","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathnt","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Daniel R.

We show that $\\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003. As an important step towards our construction, we introduce and study properties of a particular type of loxodromic element, which we call an $\\epsilon$-contracting element, and construct our free subsemigroups in such a way that all of their elements are either $\\epsilon$-contracting or $2\\epsilon$-contracting. One of the main novelties in this approach is that it enables us to study the action of $G$ on its Furstenberg boundary $G/P$ intrinsically, in the sense that we do not embed $G/P$ into a product of projective spaces associated to the proximal irreducible algebraic Tits representations of $G$. This definition is inspired by the notion of $\\epsilon$-proximal elements, which plays a prominent role in the seminal works of Abels--Margulis--Soifer on the actions of linear groups on projective spaces and of Benoist on algebraic and asymptotic properties of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups. We hope this perspective will lead to further developments in the study of discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups and provide simpler proofs of results currently in the literature.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.268996","language":"en","tags":["mathdg","mathds","mathgt","preprints","research","mathematics","mathgr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Aleksander Skenderi","raw_content_length":1830,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Lie","Leuzinger"],"persons":["Kazhdan"],"locations":["Kassel"],"monetary":["\\Gamma$.","G$.","\\Gamma$"]},"char_count":1825,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Asymptotically large free semigroups","Zariski dense discrete subgroups","Lie groups","Gamma","arXiv251010863v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","finite center","no compact factors","a Zariski dense discrete subgroup","free finitely generated subsemigroups"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Asymptotically large free semigroups":2.0,"Zariski dense discrete subgroups":2.0,"Lie groups":2.0,"Gamma":2.0,"arXiv251010863v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"finite center":1.0,"no compact factors":1.0,"a Zariski dense discrete subgroup":1.0,"free finitely generated subsemigroups":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7853882841666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8449,"joy":0.0512,"surprise":0.0779,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.003,"anger":0.0137,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

These two series are defined by explicit expansions in terms of Jack polynomials $J^{(\\alpha)}_\\lambda$, and for $\\alpha=2$ they specialize to the hypergeometric series of matrix arguments studied by Herz (1955) and Constantine (1963) that admit analogous expansions in terms of zonal polynomials. In this paper we determine explicit partial differential equations that characterize ${}_pF_q$, thereby answering a question posed by Macdonald. More precisely, for each $n,p,q$ we construct three differential operators $\\mathcal A=\\mathcal A^{(x,y)}$, $\\mathcal B=\\mathcal B^{(x)}$, $\\mathcal C=C^{(x)}$, and we show that ${}_pF_q(x,y)$ and ${}_pF_q(x)$ are the unique series solutions of the equations $\\mathcal A(f)=0$ and $\\mathcal C(f)=0$, respectively, subject to certain symmetry and boundary conditions. We also prove that the equation $\\mathcal B(f)=0$ characterizes ${}_pF_q(x)$, but only after one restricts the domain of $\\mathcal B$ to the set of series satisfying an additional stability condition with respect to $n$. Special cases of the operators $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathcal B$ have been constructed previously in the literature, but only for a small number of pairs $(p,q)$, namely for $p \\leq 3$ and $q \\leq 2$ in the zonal case by Muirhead (1970), Constantine--Muirhead (1972), and Fujikoshi (1975); and for $p \\leq 2$ and $q \\leq 1$ in the general Jack case by Macdonald (1980s), Yan (1992), Kaneko (1993), and Baker--Forrester (1997).

The primary computational bottleneck arises from the need to solve large-scale Linear Programming (LP) relaxations within branch-and-cut. Conventional simplex and barrier methods become computationally prohibitive at this scale due to their reliance on expensive matrix factorizations. While matrix-free first-order methods present a promising alternative, their tendency to converge to non-vertex solutions renders them incompatible with standard branch-and-cut procedures. To bridge this gap, we propose a successive fixing framework that leverages a customized GPU-accelerated first-order LP solver to guide a logic-driven variable-fixing strategy. Each iteration produces a reduced Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, which is subsequently tightened via presolving. This iterative cycle of relaxation, fixing, and presolving progressively reduces problem complexity, producing a highly tractable final MILP model.

In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article. Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions. The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10897","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.273636","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","math-ph","mathmp","cond-matquant-gas","research","mathematics","cond-matmes-hall","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Benjamin Anwasia, Diogo Ars\\'enio","raw_content_length":1700,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Fermi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1693,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hydrodynamics","degenerate Fermi gases","spherical Fermi surfaces","new Abstract","the description","a Fermi gas","free electrons","Fermi","a precise mathematical understanding","the Fermi ground state"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hydrodynamics":2.0,"degenerate Fermi gases":2.0,"spherical Fermi surfaces":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the description":1.0,"a Fermi gas":1.0,"free electrons":1.0,"Fermi":1.0,"a precise mathematical understanding":1.0,"the Fermi ground state":1.0}},"age_hours":2.785544506388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.453999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6908,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8526,"joy":0.0463,"surprise":0.0618,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0191,"disgust":0.0051},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on theoretical research regarding the hydrodynamics of Fermi gases, specifically the behavior of electrons in metals.

These advantages naturally extend to more general settings, including strongly convex and Hessian-aware optimization. \\noindent Overall, this work offers a novel sketch-based perspective on ZOO that explains why and when RFD-type methods can achieve \\emph{weakly dimension-independent} convergence in general smooth problems, providing both theoretical foundations and practical implications for ZOO.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10945","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.276402","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Haishan Ye, Xiangyu Chang, Xi Chen","raw_content_length":1628,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RFD","Hessian"],"persons":["\\epsilon$-suboptimal"],"locations":["ZOO","\\emph{oblivious"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1623,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Unified Zeroth","ZOO","arXiv251010945v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a new framework","zeroth-order optimization","the perspective","emphoblivious randomized sketchingIn this framework","gradient estimators","finite difference"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Unified Zeroth":2.0,"ZOO":2.0,"arXiv251010945v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a new framework":1.0,"zeroth-order optimization":1.0,"the perspective":1.0,"emphoblivious randomized sketchingIn this framework":1.0,"gradient estimators":1.0,"finite difference":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7856309205555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8035,"joy":0.0644,"surprise":0.0725,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.0374,"disgust":0.0082},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel mathematical framework for improving zeroth-order optimization, potentially leading to more efficient algorithms used in various fields, including climate modeling and renewable energy optimization.

Such products form into the notion of an anti-pre-Leibniz algebra, which is characterized as a Leibniz-admissible algebra which renders a representation of the sub-adjacent Leibniz algebra through the negative multiplication operators. Such a characterization serves as the converse side of the role that pre-Liebniz algebras play in the splitting theory of Leibniz algebras, which justifies the name of anti-pre-Leibniz algebras. There is a compatible anti-pre-Leibniz algebra structure on a Leibniz algebra if and only if there is an invertible anti-$\\mathcal{O}$-operator of the Leibniz algebra. Another important role that anti-pre-Leibniz algebras play is that they give a new characterization of Novikov dialgebras, that is, a Novikov dialgebra is interpreted as a transformed pre-Leibniz algebra which gives rise to an anti-pre-Leibniz algebra structure through specific combinations of multiplications.

From Mayo Clinic's real data, most patients' treatment durations are asymmetric (e.g., shorter/longer durations tend to have a longer right/left tail). Motivated by this observation, we consider a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model under an asymmetric and multi-modal ambiguity set, where the distribution of the random treatment duration is modeled as a mixture of distributions from different patient types. The ambiguity set captures uncertainty in both the mode probabilities, modeled via a variation-distance-based set, and the distributions within each mode, characterized by moment information such as the empirical mean, variance, and semivariance. We reformulate the DRO model as a semi-infinite program, which cannot be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. To overcome this, we derive a closed-form expression for the worst-case expected cost and establish lower and upper bounds that are positively related to the variability of patient types assigned to each group, based on which we develop exact algorithms and highly efficient clustering-based heuristics. The lower and upper bounds on the worst-case cost imply that the optimal cost tends to decrease if we group patient types with similar treatment times. Through numerical experiments based on both synthetic datasets and Mayo Clinic's real data, we illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed exact algorithms and heuristics and showcase the benefits of incorporating asymmetric information into the DRO formulation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10953","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.277222","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":266,"author":"Qing Zhu, Xian Yu, Yu-Li Huang","raw_content_length":1856,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.33,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mayo Clinic's","Asymmetric and Multi arXiv:2510.10953v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","DRO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1855,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Distributionally Robust Optimization","Chemotherapy Scheduling","Asymmetric","Multi","arXiv251010953v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","patient types","groups","a representative time-slot duration","each group"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Distributionally Robust Optimization":2.0,"Chemotherapy Scheduling":2.0,"Asymmetric":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251010953v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"patient types":1.0,"groups":1.0,"a representative time-slot duration":1.0,"each group":1.0}},"age_hours":2.785661737777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9102,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0606,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0039,"anger":0.0101,"disgust":0.0033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on optimizing chemotherapy scheduling to minimize idle time and overtime, using real data from Mayo Clinic.

A bounded Littlewood identity is one where the sum is taken over the partitions with a bounded number of rows or columns. The price to pay is that the infinite product has to be replaced by a determinant. The focus of this article is on refinements of such bounded Littlewood identities where one also prescribes the number of odd-length rows or columns of the partitions. Goulden [{\\it Discrete Math.} {\\bf99} (1992), 69--77] had given such a refinement in which the number of columns is bounded and the number of odd-length rows is prescribed. We provide refinements where the number of columns is bounded and the number of odd-length columns is prescribed. Furthermore, we present new formulations of such bounded Littlewood identities involving skewing operators. As corollaries we obtain non-standard formulas for numbers of standard Young tableaux with restricted shapes as above. In the last part of the article we discuss combinatorial interpretations of such identities in terms of up-down tableaux.

With this pairing, an expected utility maximizer (DM) is characterized by a continuous closed convex comprehensive set of utility acts (c-utility act set). We show that DM M values information more than DM L if and only if the c-utility act set of DM M is obtained by Minkowski addition from the cutility act set of DM L. In the classic setting of decision theory, this is interpreted as the equivalence between more valuable information, on the one hand, and multiplying decisions and adding utility, on the other hand (additively separable utility). We also introduce the algebraic structure of dioid to describe two operations between DMs: union (adding options) and fusion (multiplying options and adding utilities). We say that DM M is more exible by union (resp. by fusion) than DM L if DM M is obtained by union (resp. by fusion) from DM L.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_c44cbb5f845d","title":"Area Law for the entanglement entropy of free fermions in nonrandom ergodic field","content":"arXiv:2510.11111v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The paper deals with the asymptotic behavior of one of the widely used characteristics of correlations in large quantum systems. The correlations are known as quantum entanglement, the characteristic is called the entanglement entropy, and as large systems we consider an ideal gas of spinless lattice fermions. The system is determined by its one-body Hamiltonian. As shown in \\cite{EPS}, if the Hamiltonian is an ergodic finite difference operator with exponentially decaying spectral projection, then the asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy is the so-called Area Law. However, the only one-body Hamiltonian for which this spectral condition is verified is the $d$-dimensional discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators with random potential. In the present paper, we prove that the same asymptotic form of the entanglement entropy holds for a wide class of Schr\\\"odinger operators whose potentials are ergodic but nonrandom. We start with the quasiperiodic and limit periodic operators, and then pass to the interesting and highly non-trivial case of the potentials generated by subshifts of finite type. They arose in the theory of dynamical systems in the study of non-random chaotic phenomena. As it turns out, obtaining the asymptotics of the entanglement entropy of free fermions requires a quite involved spectral analysis of the corresponding Schr\\\"odinger operator. Specifically, we prove for this class two important and interesting in itself spectral properties, known as exponential dynamic localisation in expectation and the exponential decay of the eigenfunction correlator, implying the Area Law for the entanglement entropy.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11111","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.285243","language":"en","tags":["mathds","mathsp","preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Leonid Pastur, Mira Shamis","raw_content_length":1690,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$d$-dimensional discrete"]},"char_count":1689,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the entanglement entropy","Area Law","free fermions","nonrandom ergodic field","Announce Type","new Abstract","The paper","the asymptotic behavior","the widely used characteristics","correlations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the entanglement entropy":3.0,"Area Law":2.0,"free fermions":2.0,"nonrandom ergodic field":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The paper":1.0,"the asymptotic behavior":1.0,"the widely used characteristics":1.0,"correlations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7859263391666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.221,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8442,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7895,"joy":0.0396,"surprise":0.1198,"sadness":0.0091,"fear":0.0087,"anger":0.0199,"disgust":0.0135},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on the entanglement entropy of free fermions, proving that the Area Law holds for a wider class of Schr\"odinger operators.

The cost of control is proportional to the magnitude of adjustments. This paper characterizes the optimal policy and the value in a class of multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control problems. These problems involve a linearly controlled one-dimensional stochastic differential equation, whose coefficients, along with the cost functional to be optimized, depend on a multi-dimensional uncontrolled process Y. We first provide general verification theorems providing an optimal control in terms of a Skorokhod reflection at Y-dependent free boundaries, which emerge from the analysis of an auxiliary Dynkin game. We then fully solve two two-dimensional optimal inventory management problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to establish a connection between multi-dimensional ergodic singular stochastic control and optimal stopping, and to exploit this connection to achieve a complete solution in a genuinely two-dimensional setting.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11158","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.287465","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","preprints","mathoc","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Alessandro Calvia, Federico Cannerozzi, Giorgio Ferrari","raw_content_length":1248,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Skorokhod","Optimal Policy Characterization","Dynkin"],"persons":["Y.

Using bipartite graph representations, we identify a node partition in fibres, based on equivalent incidence relations in hypergraphs. We study how identical nodes with an isomorphic input set can synchronize due to structural properties under our specific model assumptions, examining the dynamical model of Kuramoto with higher-order interactions and frustration parameters. Recent works established for directed hypergraphs that balanced partitions characterize robust synchrony, invariant under all admissible dynamics, whereas our contribution isolates the case of Kuramoto dynamics and shows that synchrony under homogeneous initial conditions and natural frequencies necessarily coincides with the fibration partition. As a conclusion, let us examine situations that require adjustments to the hypergraph topology to handle redundancy or to align with a target cluster configuration, especially in the presence of noise or incomplete information. These considerations open up new questions for future investigations. Our methodology combines theoretical modeling and simulations with applications to real-world data topologies, highlighting how representational choices and local input equivalence influence synchronization behavior.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11207","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.289733","language":"en","tags":["mathds","preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Margherita Bert\\`e, Tommaso Gili","raw_content_length":1460,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fibration Symmetries","Kuramoto","HOI"],"persons":[],"locations":["node"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1459,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fibration Symmetries","Cluster Synchronization","Multi","arXiv251011207v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","recent advances","fibration symmetry theory","how structural symmetries influence synchronization","systems","higher-order interactions"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fibration Symmetries":2.0,"Cluster Synchronization":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251011207v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"recent advances":1.0,"fibration symmetry theory":1.0,"how structural symmetries influence synchronization":1.0,"systems":1.0,"higher-order interactions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.786076495,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8749,"joy":0.0138,"surprise":0.0743,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.007},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores theoretical modeling of synchronization in complex systems, specifically Kuramoto dynamics with higher-order interactions.

In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of the directed analogs of Thomassen's conjecture one obtains when replacing minimum degree by minimum out-degree. Concretely, we study which digraphs $F$ are avoidable in the sense that there exists $d_F:\\mathbb{N}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that every digraph of minimum out-degree at least $d_F(k)$ contains an $F$-free subdigraph of minimum out-degree at least $k$. Among our main results, we show that all orientations of $C_3$ and $C_5$ are avoidable, while one-directed orientations of complete bipartite graphs and all oriented trees are not avoidable. This, in particular, shows that the most direct extension of Thomassen's conjecture to digraphs is false. We also fully characterize which digraphs are avoidable when restricting the setting to regular host digraphs.

The proposed approach constructs a non-intrusive, data-driven reduced-order model by employing a parameter-separable structure to handle stochastic dependencies and directly minimizing the L2 norm of the output error via gradient-based optimization. Compared to existing methods, this framework offers three significant advantages: it is entirely data-driven, relying solely on output measurements without requiring access to internal system matrices; it guarantees approximation accuracy for control outputs, aligning directly with the optimization objective; and its computational complexity is independent of the original PDE dimension, ensuring feasibility for real-time control applications. Numerical experiments on stochastic diffusion and advection-diffusion equations demonstrate the method's effectiveness and efficiency, providing a systematic solution for the real-time control of complex uncertain systems and bridging the gap between model reduction theory and practical engineering.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11325","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.298623","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Jingyi Zhang","raw_content_length":1226,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PDE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1225,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["multiscale stochastic optimal control problems","A model reduction method","nonlinear optimization","Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","a nonlinear optimization-based model reduction method","stochastic partial differential equations","The proposed approach","a non-intrusive data-driven reduced-order model"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"multiscale stochastic optimal control problems":3.0,"A model reduction method":2.0,"nonlinear optimization":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a nonlinear optimization-based model reduction method":1.0,"stochastic partial differential equations":1.0,"The proposed approach":1.0,"a non-intrusive data-driven reduced-order model":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7862932344444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8248,"joy":0.0726,"surprise":0.051,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.012,"anger":0.0238,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a model reduction method for stochastic optimal control problems, which could lead to more efficient control of systems relevant to sustainability, such as energy grids or chemical processes.

To address this, the paper introduces the \"Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle,\" a framework that maps discourses based on their relative concern for three areas (represented as three vertices in the triangle): \"Mathematics\", \"Community\", and \"Society/Planet\". By integrating a systems theoretic perspective, we analyse discourses as dynamic systemic reactions to external irritations. Our analysis reveals that the field's fragmentation can be explained by the \"location effect\": the phenomenon whereby a discourse's position within the triangle shapes its perception and acceptance of other scholarship. By mapping key discourses and educator archetypes, the framework functions as a meta-heuristic tool. Ultimately, it serves not only to facilitate critical reflection but also as a call for the epistemic humility and dialogue needed to advance the field.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11327","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.299225","language":"en","tags":["mathho","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Dennis M\\\"uller, Maurice Chiodo, Michael Meyer","raw_content_length":1119,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the \"Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1118,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mathematics","The Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle","A Framework","Discourses","Its Education","arXiv251011327v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The literature","ethics","sustainability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["The Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mathematics":3.0,"The Ethical and Sustainable Concerns Triangle":2.0,"A Framework":2.0,"Discourses":2.0,"Its Education":2.0,"arXiv251011327v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The literature":1.0,"ethics":1.0,"sustainability":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7863089902777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7003,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.0582,"sadness":0.0211,"fear":0.1581,"anger":0.0372,"disgust":0.0095},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a framework for analyzing discourses related to ethics and sustainability in mathematics education.

The methodology builds on a two-window inspection scheme (TWIN), which aggregates data into symmetric samples and applies strong weighting to enhance statistical performance. The detector yields logarithmic rather than polynomial detection delays, representing a substantial reduction compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Delays remain short, even for late changes, where existing methods perform worst. Moreover, the new procedure also attains higher power than current methods across broad classes of local alternatives. For mean changes, we further introduce a self-normalized version of the detector that automatically cancels out temporal dependence, eliminating the need to estimate nuisance parameters. The advantages of our approach are supported by asymptotic theory, simulations and an application to monitoring COVID19 data. Here, structural breaks associated with new virus variants are detected almost immediately by our new procedures. This indicates potential value for the real-time monitoring of future epidemics. Mathematically, our approach is underpinned by new exponential moment bounds for the global modulus of continuity of the partial sum process, which may be of independent interest beyond change point testing.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11348","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.302204","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Patrick Bastian, Tim Kutta","raw_content_length":1433,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["TWIN","Two window inspection","online change point detection","arXiv251011348v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a new class","sequential change point tests","changes","the mean parameter","the overall distribution function"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"TWIN":3.0,"Two window inspection":2.0,"online change point detection":2.0,"arXiv251011348v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a new class":1.0,"sequential change point tests":1.0,"changes":1.0,"the mean parameter":1.0,"the overall distribution function":1.0}},"age_hours":2.786374540277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8935,"joy":0.0178,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0285,"anger":0.0216,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new method for change point detection, demonstrating logarithmic detection delays compared to polynomial delays of existing methods.

The dynamics are governed by a nonlinear three-state system describing soil fertility, residue biomass, and accumulated energy, with a single control representing the proportion of biomass diverted to energy. The objective is to maximize a discounted net benefit that accounts for energy revenue, soil value, and operational costs. We apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle in current-value form to derive necessary optimality conditions and characterize the structure of optimal controls.

Within a Hamilton-Jacobi framework, the viability kernel is characterized as the zero sublevel set of a value function satisfying a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in the viscosity sense. This formulation provides formal guarantees for ensuring that system trajectories remain within prescribed operational limits under worst-case scenarios. Compared to existing viability studies, this work introduces a rigorous HJB-based characterization explicitly incorporating uncertainty, tailored to nonlinear WtE dynamics. A numerical scheme based on the Local Lax-Friedrichs method is employed to approximate the viability kernel.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_e1554da2fe15","title":"Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent","content":"arXiv:2510.11440v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Selecting an effective step-size is a fundamental challenge in first-order optimization, especially for problems with non-Euclidean geometries. This paper presents a novel adaptive step-size strategy for optimization algorithms that rely on linear minimization oracles, as used in the Conditional Gradient or non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms. Using a simple heuristic to estimate a local Lipschitz constant for the gradient, we can determine step-sizes that guarantee sufficient decrease at each iteration. More precisely, we establish convergence guarantees for our proposed Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent algorithm, which covers as special cases both the classical Conditional Gradient algorithm and non-Euclidean Normalized Steepest Descent algorithms with adaptive step-sizes. Our analysis covers optimization of continuously differentiable functions in non-convex, quasar-convex, and strongly convex settings, achieving convergence rates that match state-of-the-art theoretical bounds. Comprehensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical effectiveness of Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent. The results exhibit competitive performance, underscoring the potential of the adaptive step-size for applications.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11440","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.314551","language":"en","tags":["statml","preprints","mathoc","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Abbas Khademi, Antonio Silveti-Falls","raw_content_length":1337,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Conditional Gradient","Conditional Gradient","Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent"],"persons":["Lipschitz"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1336,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent","arXiv251011440v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","an effective step-size","a fundamental challenge","first-order optimization","problems","non-Euclidean geometries","This paper"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive Conditional Gradient Descent":2.0,"arXiv251011440v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"an effective step-size":1.0,"a fundamental challenge":1.0,"first-order optimization":1.0,"problems":1.0,"non-Euclidean geometries":1.0,"This paper":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7866327380555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.9295,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8717,"joy":0.0245,"surprise":0.0617,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.0125,"anger":0.0182,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents an adaptive step-size strategy for optimization algorithms, potentially improving the efficiency of algorithms used in various applications.
