Unfortunately, it is often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization. Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture different collision-avoidance behaviors.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09204","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.699820","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","csro","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Simon Idoko, Arun Kumar Singh","raw_content_length":1920,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Flow-Opt","DiT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1919,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Flow","arXiv251009204v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Centralized trajectory optimization","the joint space","multiple robots","access","a larger feasible space","smoother trajectories","tight spaces"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Flow":2.0,"arXiv251009204v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Centralized trajectory optimization":1.0,"the joint space":1.0,"multiple robots":1.0,"access":1.0,"a larger feasible space":1.0,"smoother trajectories":1.0,"tight spaces":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7654261266666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8602,"joy":0.0092,"surprise":0.0554,"sadness":0.0475,"fear":0.0166,"anger":0.0056,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a learning-based approach to improve the computational tractability of multi-robot trajectory optimization, potentially leading to more efficient automation in various sectors.

However, challenges persist in their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the 3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements. Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging system, enhancing the data diversity in this field.

In addition to the ability to perform daily activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage. Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight (311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks.

However, these developments have the potential to cause misunderstandings and conflicts, as data poisoning has traditionally been regarded as a security threat to machine learning systems. To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless poisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling users to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we propose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge. We introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data poisoning: {\\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\\em poisoning-concurrent watermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within the range of $\\Theta(1/\\epsilon_w^2)$ to $O(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_p)$ for poisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably ensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the practicality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks.

Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\\% and 29.4\\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09211","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.701770","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Yiqi Li, Yusheng Liao, Zhe Chen, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang","raw_content_length":1313,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CoT","SLM-Guided Chain"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1312,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","DICE","Structured Reasoning","SLM-Guided Chain","arXiv251009211v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","reasoning tasks","user-specific requirements","strict output formats","large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":4.0,"DICE":3.0,"Structured Reasoning":2.0,"SLM-Guided Chain":2.0,"arXiv251009211v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"reasoning tasks":1.0,"user-specific requirements":1.0,"strict output formats":1.0,"large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765488332222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8987,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0222,"sadness":0.0125,"fear":0.0174,"anger":0.0274,"disgust":0.0165},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (DICE) to improve the accuracy and format adherence of LLM outputs.

While existing long-video methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting (e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions (e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks, including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying its versatility and state-of-the-art role.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.702204","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Wuyang Li, Wentao Pan, Po-Chien Luan, Yang Gao, Alexandre Alahi","raw_content_length":1905,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning","SVI","DiT","the Diffusion Transformer"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1904,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Stable Video Infinity","Infinite","Announce Type","new Abstract","SVI","infinite-length videos","high temporal consistency","plausible scene transitions","controllable streaming storylines","existing long-video methods"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Stable Video Infinity":3.0,"Infinite":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"SVI":1.0,"infinite-length videos":1.0,"high temporal consistency":1.0,"plausible scene transitions":1.0,"controllable streaming storylines":1.0,"existing long-video methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765504198055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9472,"joy":0.0141,"surprise":0.0214,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.0022,"anger":0.0074,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for generating infinite-length videos.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_5f13ab2faeaa","title":"A Hybrid I/O Relation Estimation Scheme for Zak","content":"arXiv:2510.09215v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the delay-Doppler (DD) domain input-output (I/O) relation in Zak-OTFS modulation, which is needed for signal detection. Two approaches, namely, model-dependent and model-free approaches, can be employed for this purpose. The model-dependent approach requires explicit estimation of the physical channel parameters (path delays, Dopplers, and gains) to obtain the I/O relation. Such an explicit estimation is not required in the model-free approach, where the I/O relation can be estimated by reading off the samples in the fundamental DD period of the received pilot frame. Model-free approach has the advantage of acquiring fractional DD channels with simplicity. However, the read-off in the model-free approach provides an estimate of the effective channel only over a limited region in the DD plane but it does not provide an estimate for the region outside, and this can affect the estimation performance depending on the pulse shaping characteristics of the DD pulse shaping filter used. A poorly localized DD pulse shape leads to an increased degradation in performance. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel, yet simple, I/O relation estimation scheme that alleviates the above issue in the model-free approach. We achieve this by obtaining a coarse estimate of the effective channel outside the model-free estimation region using a novel model-dependent scheme and using this estimate along with the model-free estimate to obtain an improved estimate of the overall I/O relation. We devise the proposed estimation scheme for both exclusive and embedded pilot frames. Our simulation results using Vehicular-A, TDL-A and TDL-C channel models with fractional DDs show that the proposed hybrid estimation approach achieves superior performance compared to the pure model-free approach.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09215","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.702669","language":"en","tags":["research","mathit","preprints","eesssp","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":284,"author":"Sai Pradeep Muppaneni, Vineetha Yogesh, A.

These requirements call for an efficient ultra-low rate code design. In this work, we propose a novel coding scheme tailored for PUFs based on Polar codes and a low-complexity version of automorphism ensemble decoding (AED). Notably, our serial AED scheme reuses a single successive cancellation (SC) decoder across multiple decoding attempts. By introducing cascaded and recursive interleavers, we efficiently scale the number of AED candidates without requiring expensive large multiplexers. An aggressive quantization strategy of only 3 bits per message further reduces the area requirements of the underlying SC decoder. The resulting coding scheme achieves the same block error rate of $10^{-6}$ as our baseline based on Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes while requiring 1.75x fewer codeword bits to encode the same K = 312 payload bits.

These systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective framework that integrates \\textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations. A \\textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing recommendation systems.

Yet their computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex) problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin). PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities.

In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09230","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.707302","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Jindong Hong, Wencheng Zhang, Shiqin Qiao, Jianhai Chen, Jianing Qiu, Chuanyang Zheng, Qian Xu, Yun Ji, Qianyue Wen, Weiwei Sun, Hao Li, Huizhen Li, Huichao Wang, Kai Wu, Meng Li, Yijun He, Lingjie Luo, Jiankai Sun","raw_content_length":1674,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multimodal Large Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":["a.k.a."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1673,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Shoulder Disorders","Multimodal Large Language Models","Consumer","arXiv251009230v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Shoulder disorders","frozen shoulder","aka","adhesive capsulitis","common conditions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Shoulder Disorders":2.0,"Multimodal Large Language Models":2.0,"Consumer":2.0,"arXiv251009230v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Shoulder disorders":1.0,"frozen shoulder":1.0,"aka":1.0,"adhesive capsulitis":1.0,"common conditions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7656872225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2463,"joy":0.0035,"surprise":0.0092,"sadness":0.0568,"fear":0.6236,"anger":0.0319,"disgust":0.0288},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel application of MLLMs for shoulder disorder diagnosis, showing a 79.6% accuracy increase compared to direct video diagnosis.

Traditional methods, such as drive tests and operator equipment counters, are costly, limited, or fail to capture end-to-end (E2E) Quality of Service (QoS) and its variability. In this work, we leverage large-scale crowdsourced measurements-including E2E, radio, contextual and network deployment features collected by the user equipment (UE)-to propose an uncertainty-aware and explainable approach for downlink user throughput estimation. We first validate prior 4G methods, improving R^2 by 8.7%, and then extend them to 5G NSA and 5G SA, providing the first benchmarks for 5G crowdsourced datasets. To address the variability of throughput, we apply NGBoost, a model that outputs both point estimates and calibrated confidence intervals, representing its first use in the field of computer communications. Finally, we use the proposed model to analyze the evolution from 4G to 5G SA, and show that throughput bottlenecks move from the RAN to transport and service layers, as seen by E2E metrics gaining importance over radio-related features.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09239","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.707711","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","csni","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Javier Albert-Smet, Zoraida Frias, Luis Mendo, Sergio Melones, Eduardo Yraola","raw_content_length":1329,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Uncertainty Modeling","Crowdsourced Measurements arXiv:2510.09239v1 Announce Type","RAN","Quality of Service"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1328,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["5G User Throughput","Uncertainty Modeling and Crowdsourced Measurements","Announce Type","new Abstract","application-layer user throughput","next-generation networks","the higher capacity","the 5G Radio Access Network","RAN","shifts connectivity bottlenecks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Uncertainty Modeling and Crowdsourced Measurements","RAN"],"business_innovation":["RAN"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"5G User Throughput":2.0,"Uncertainty Modeling and Crowdsourced Measurements":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"application-layer user throughput":1.0,"next-generation networks":1.0,"the higher capacity":1.0,"the 5G Radio Access Network":1.0,"RAN":1.0,"shifts connectivity bottlenecks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765703815833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.1749999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.765,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6481,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0217,"sadness":0.0219,"fear":0.2535,"anger":0.0289,"disgust":0.021},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the efficiency of 5G networks, which can indirectly reduce energy consumption by optimizing data transfer.

However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios. Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09240","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.708105","language":"en","tags":["research","csgt","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Jiangwei Chen, Kieu Thao Nguyen Pham, Rachael Hwee Ling Sim, Arun Verma, Zhaoxuan Wu, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","raw_content_length":1279,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Incentivizing Time arXiv:2510.09240v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1278,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Incentivizing Time","arXiv251009240v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","collaborative data sharing","machine learning","multiple parties","their data resources","a machine learning model","better model performance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["machine learning","a machine learning model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Incentivizing Time":2.0,"arXiv251009240v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"collaborative data sharing":1.0,"machine learning":1.0,"multiple parties":1.0,"their data resources":1.0,"a machine learning model":1.0,"better model performance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7657191144444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.741,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9482,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8994,"joy":0.0083,"surprise":0.0062,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0138,"anger":0.0397,"disgust":0.0276},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article proposes a framework for incentivizing data sharing in collaborative machine learning.

A systematic paired evaluation (with/without RDWT) is conducted on four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, MBEEG\\_SENet, and EEGTCNet. This evaluation was carried out across three benchmark datasets: High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, and BCI-IV-2b. The performance of the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44 percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58 pp; +0.008). On BCI-IV-2b, the enhancements observed are modest yet consistent for EEGNet (+0.21 pp; +0.044) and EEGTCNet (+0.28 pp; +0.077). On HGD, average effects are modest to positive, with the most significant gain observed for MBEEG\\_SENet (+1.65 pp; +0.022), followed by EEGNet (+0.76 pp; +0.010) and EEGTCNet (+0.54 pp; +0.008). Inspection of the subject material reveals significant enhancements in challenging recordings (e.g., non-stationary sessions), indicating that RDWT can mitigate localized noise and enhance rhythm-specific information. In conclusion, RDWT is shown to be a low-overhead, architecture-aware preprocessing technique that can yield tangible gains in accuracy and agreement for deep model families and challenging subjects.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09242","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.708551","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cshc","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Marco Siino, Giuseppe Bonomo, Rosario Sorbello, Ilenia Tinnirello","raw_content_length":1708,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Rational Discrete Wavelet Transform","EEG"],"persons":["kappa +0.059","RDWT","Cohen"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1707,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Impact","Rational Dilated Wavelet Transform","Motor Imagery EEG","Deep Learning Models","RDWT","arXiv251009242v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The present study","the impact","the Rational Discrete Wavelet Transform"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Learning Models"],"research_academic":["The present study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Impact":2.0,"Rational Dilated Wavelet Transform":2.0,"Motor Imagery EEG":2.0,"Deep Learning Models":2.0,"RDWT":2.0,"arXiv251009242v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The present study":1.0,"the impact":1.0,"the Rational Discrete Wavelet Transform":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765736031111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8189,"joy":0.0285,"surprise":0.0831,"sadness":0.0106,"fear":0.0243,"anger":0.0215,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on a new signal processing technique (RDWT) for EEG data, improving the accuracy of motor imagery decoding with deep learning.

To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic post-editor.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09243","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.708960","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Giacomo Gonella, Gian Maria Campedelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Guerini","raw_content_length":1570,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","CrisiText","NLP"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1569,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CrisiText","A dataset","messages","LLM training","emergency communication","arXiv251009243v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","threats","their potential damage","crisis situations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM training"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CrisiText":2.0,"A dataset":2.0,"messages":2.0,"LLM training":2.0,"emergency communication":2.0,"arXiv251009243v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"threats":1.0,"their potential damage":1.0,"crisis situations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765751195,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.15500000000000014,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.969,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2188,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0089,"sadness":0.0138,"fear":0.7269,"anger":0.0201,"disgust":0.0044},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a large-scale dataset (CrisiText) for generating warning messages in crisis scenarios.

Accuracy was recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across 706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and 63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering strategy for clinical VLM applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.712145","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Patrick Wienholt, Sophie Caselitz, Robert Siepmann, Philipp Bruners, Keno Bressem, Christiane Kuhl, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Sven Nebelung, Daniel Truhn","raw_content_length":1882,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VQA-Med 2019","Hallucination Filtering","VQA","DSE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1881,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hallucination Filtering","Radiology Vision","DSE","arXiv251009256v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","discrete semantic entropy","questions","hallucinations","the accuracy","black-box vision-language models"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hallucination Filtering":2.0,"Radiology Vision":2.0,"DSE":2.0,"arXiv251009256v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"discrete semantic entropy":1.0,"questions":1.0,"hallucinations":1.0,"the accuracy":1.0,"black-box vision-language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7658689980555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8257,"joy":0.0252,"surprise":0.0751,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0317,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0151},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores a method to improve the accuracy of AI in radiology, specifically by filtering out questions likely to generate hallucinations.

This issue arises when benchmark samples may inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09259","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.712576","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Yongding Tao, Tian Wang, Yihong Dong, Huanyu Liu, Kechi Zhang, Xiaolong Hu, Ge Li","raw_content_length":1552,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Reinforcement Learning","Detecting Data Contamination","Large Language Models","Reinforcement Learning Post"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1551,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Data Contamination","Reinforcement Learning Post","arXiv251009259v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Data contamination","a significant threat","the reliable evaluation","Large Language Models","LLMs","This issue"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Reinforcement Learning Post","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Data Contamination":2.0,"Reinforcement Learning Post":2.0,"arXiv251009259v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Data contamination":1.0,"a significant threat":1.0,"the reliable evaluation":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"This issue":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765883953055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.469,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0151,"sadness":0.0243,"fear":0.3447,"anger":0.0689,"disgust":0.072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on detecting data contamination in reinforcement learning models, specifically in the post-training phase for LLMs. The concrete action is the development of a new method, Self-Critique, and a benchmark, RL-MIA, to address this issue.

However, existing methods often rely on static, rare-token-based triggers, limiting their effectiveness in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we develop GREAT, a novel framework for crafting generalizable backdoors in RLHF through emotion-aware trigger synthesis. Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_54f119353bf9","title":"Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision","content":"arXiv:2510.09269v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect.

In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the transition toward quantum-resistant security. Blockchain systems fundamentally rely on cryptographic primitives to guarantee data integrity and transaction authenticity. However, widely used algorithms such as ECDSA, employed in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although adopting PQC is essential for long-term security, its computational overhead in blockchain environments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a methodology for benchmarking both PQC and traditional cryptographic algorithms in blockchain contexts. We measure signature generation and verification times across diverse computational environments and simulate their impact at scale. Our evaluation focuses on PQC digital signature schemes (ML-DSA, Dilithium, Falcon, Mayo, SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Cross) across security levels 1 to 5, comparing them to ECDSA, the current standard in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate that PQC algorithms introduce only minor performance overhead at security level 1, while in some scenarios they significantly outperform ECDSA at higher security levels. For instance, ML-DSA achieves a verification time of 0.14 ms on an ARM-based laptop at level 5, compared to 0.88 ms for ECDSA. We also provide an open-source implementation to ensure reproducibility and encourage further research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09271","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.715017","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","preprints","computer-science","cspf","cset","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Alison Gon\\c{c}alves Schemitt (PUCRS), Henrique Fan da Silva (UNIPAMPA), Roben Castagna Lunardi (PUCRS, IFRS), Diego Kreutz (UNIPAMPA), Rodrigo Brand\\~ao Mansilha (UNIPAMPA), Avelino Francisco Zorzo (PUCRS)","raw_content_length":1697,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PQC","Bitcoin, Ethereum","the Impact of Post arXiv:2510.09271v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","NIST","the National Institute of Standards and Technology","ECDSA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1696,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Impact","Post","arXiv251009271v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The advent","quantum computing","the security","traditional encryption algorithms","the development","post-quantum cryptography"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["traditional encryption algorithms"],"engineering":["the development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Impact":2.0,"Post":2.0,"arXiv251009271v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The advent":1.0,"quantum computing":1.0,"the security":1.0,"traditional encryption algorithms":1.0,"the development":1.0,"post-quantum cryptography":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765976791388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.01,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.802,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5794,"joy":0.0441,"surprise":0.0761,"sadness":0.018,"fear":0.1997,"anger":0.0661,"disgust":0.0167},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper benchmarks post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms against existing cryptographic algorithms used in blockchain.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c6b606c21f4f","title":"Modern iOS Security Features -","content":"arXiv:2510.09272v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The XNU kernel is the basis of Apple's operating systems. Although labeled as a hybrid kernel, it is found to generally operate in a monolithic manner by defining a single privileged trust zone in which all system functionality resides. This has security implications, as a kernel compromise has immediate and significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple has taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernel architecture and a more microkernel-like design. To date, there has been no scientific discussion of SPTM and related security mechanisms. Therefore, the understanding of the system and the underlying security mechanisms is minimal. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of new security mechanisms and their interplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current mitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our analysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory mapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system, effectively gapping different functionalities from one another. Gapped functionality includes the TXM, responsible for code signing and entitlement verification. We further demonstrate how this introduction lays the groundwork for the most recent security feature of Exclaves, and conduct an in-depth analysis of its communication mechanisms. We discover multifold ways of communication, most notably xnuproxy as a secure world request handler, and the Tightbeam IPC framework. The architecture changes are found to increase system security, with key and sensitive components being moved out of XNU's direct reach. This also provides additional security guarantees in the event of a kernel compromise, which is no longer an immediate threat at the highest trust level.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09272","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.715460","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscr","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":277,"author":"Moritz Steffin, Jiska Classen","raw_content_length":1876,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.385,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["XNU","Apple","SPTM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1875,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Modern iOS Security Features","arXiv251009272v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The XNU kernel","the basis","Apples operating systems","a hybrid kernel","a monolithic manner","a single privileged trust zone","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Modern iOS Security Features":2.0,"arXiv251009272v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The XNU kernel":1.0,"the basis":1.0,"Apples operating systems":1.0,"a hybrid kernel":1.0,"a monolithic manner":1.0,"a single privileged trust zone":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.765992438055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.4785,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8957,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8216,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0137,"sadness":0.0116,"fear":0.077,"anger":0.0338,"disgust":0.0373},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes new security mechanisms in iOS, specifically SPTM and Exclaves.

Existing sampling strategies for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues, while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated \\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP), which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate accumulated errors.

Rethinking Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks with Dynamic Evaluation","content":"arXiv:2510.09275v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09275","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.716260","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Xiangxu Zhang, Lei Li, Yanyun Zhou, Xiao Zhou, Yingying Zhang, Xian Wu","raw_content_length":1527,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Inflated Excellence"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1526,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Inflated Excellence or True Performance","Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks","Dynamic Evaluation","arXiv251009275v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Medical diagnostics","a high-stakes","complex domain","patient care","current evaluations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["complex domain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Inflated Excellence or True Performance":2.0,"Medical Diagnostic Benchmarks":2.0,"Dynamic Evaluation":2.0,"arXiv251009275v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Medical diagnostics":1.0,"a high-stakes":1.0,"complex domain":1.0,"patient care":1.0,"current evaluations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.76602267,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.18,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.836,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8073,"joy":0.0026,"surprise":0.0544,"sadness":0.0092,"fear":0.0185,"anger":0.0752,"disgust":0.0328},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a new benchmark (DyReMe) for evaluating LLMs in medical diagnostics.

However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and professionalism.

This paper presents a new method to compare FSMPC variants. The method is based on analyzing the modulation, implicit or explicit, used by each variant. In the paper the method is used to compare single-vector state-of-the-art FSMPC with a multi-vector variant designed to cancel xy currents and simplify the cost function. The results show the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Also, it is found that the trade-offs between figures, previously thought to concern just individual regimes, extend to the whole operating space and also can be pinpoint to each FSMPC variant.

Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation.

In this paper, we undertake a pioneering exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks, VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models, with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales. Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LVLMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09285","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.718066","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Siyuan Huang, Xiaoye Qu, Yafu Li, Yun Luo, Zefeng He, Daizong Liu, Yu Cheng","raw_content_length":1728,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Vision-Language Models","CoT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1727,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Spotlight","Token Perception","Multimodal Reinforcement Learning","arXiv251009285v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Reinforcement Learning","Verifiable Rewards","RLVR","the reasoning capabilities","Large Vision-Language Models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Spotlight":2.0,"Token Perception":2.0,"Multimodal Reinforcement Learning":2.0,"arXiv251009285v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Reinforcement Learning":1.0,"Verifiable Rewards":1.0,"RLVR":1.0,"the reasoning capabilities":1.0,"Large Vision-Language Models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7660865666666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.816,"joy":0.0235,"surprise":0.0293,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0706,"anger":0.0329,"disgust":0.0212},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel policy gradient algorithm (VPPO) to enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LVLMs. While the research demonstrates substantial gains on perception and reasoning benchmarks, it is still in the applied research phase with no deployed units or real-world impact data.

We show that human visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study, we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4 million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09299","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.721226","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Tejaswi V.

Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability.

Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_eab7d1510ca2","title":"Improved Extended Regular Expression Matching","content":"arXiv:2510.09311v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: An extended regular expression $R$ specifies a set of strings formed by characters from an alphabet combined with concatenation, union, intersection, complement, and star operators. Given an extended regular expression $R$ and a string $Q$, the extended regular expression matching problem is to decide if $Q$ matches any of the strings specified by $R$. Extended regular expressions are a basic concept in formal language theory and a basic primitive for searching and processing data. Extended regular expression matching was introduced by Hopcroft and Ullmann in the 1970s [\\textit{Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation}, 1979], who gave a simple dynamic programming solution using $O(n^3m)$ time and $O(n^2m)$ space, where $n$ is the length of $Q$ and $m$ is the length of $R$. Since then, several solutions have been proposed, but few significant asymptotic improvements have been obtained. The current state-of-the art solution, by Yamamoto and Miyazaki~[COCOON, 2003], uses $O(\\frac{n^3k + n^2m}{w} + n + m)$ time and $O(\\frac{n^2k + nm}{w} + n + m)$ space, where $k$ is the number of negation and complement operators in $R$ and $w$ is the number of bits in a word. This roughly replaces the $m$ factor with $k$ in the dominant terms of both the space and time bounds of the Hopcroft and Ullmann algorithm. We revisit the problem and present a new solution that significantly improves the previous time and space bounds. Our main result is a new algorithm that solves extended regular expression matching in \\[O\\left(n^\\omega k + \\frac{n^2m}{\\min(w/\\log w, \\log n)} + m\\right)\\] time and $O(\\frac{n^2 \\log k}{w} + n + m) = O(n^2 +m)$ space, where $\\omega \\approx 2.3716$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. Essentially, this replaces the dominant $n^3k$ term with $n^\\omega k$ in the time bound, while simultaneously improving the $n^2k$ term in the space to $O(n^2)$.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09311","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.723315","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csds","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":306,"author":"Philip Bille, Inge Li G{\\o}rtz, Rikke Schjeldrup Jessen","raw_content_length":1954,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.53,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Automata Theory"],"persons":["Ullmann","Hopcroft"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1951,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Improved Extended Regular Expression Matching","arXiv251009311v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","An extended regular expression R specifies","a set","strings","characters","an alphabet","concatenation","union"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Improved Extended Regular Expression Matching":2.0,"arXiv251009311v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"An extended regular expression R specifies":1.0,"a set":1.0,"strings":1.0,"characters":1.0,"an alphabet":1.0,"concatenation":1.0,"union":1.0}},"age_hours":2.766286031944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9394,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0239,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0049,"anger":0.0128,"disgust":0.0087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm for extended regular expression matching, improving time and space complexity.

We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09312","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.723729","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Zheng Zhao, Yeskendir Koishekenov, Xianjun Yang, Naila Murray, Nicola Cancedda","raw_content_length":1450,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CoT","Verifying Chain arXiv:2510.09312v1 Announce Type","Reasoning Verification"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1449,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Verifying Chain","arXiv251009312v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Thought","CoT","reasoning correctness","outputs","black-box","activations","gray-box"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Verifying Chain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Verifying Chain":2.0,"arXiv251009312v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Thought":1.0,"CoT":1.0,"reasoning correctness":1.0,"outputs":1.0,"black-box":1.0,"activations":1.0,"gray-box":1.0}},"age_hours":2.766302201666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.3864999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7227,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8647,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0207,"sadness":0.0098,"fear":0.0348,"anger":0.0431,"disgust":0.0223},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for verifying the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their computational graphs.

To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2, ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity mismatches.

Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09330","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.726890","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Tuan Nguyen, Long Tran-Thanh","raw_content_length":1503,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","LP Solvers arXiv:2510.09330v1","Blackbox Agentic AI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1502,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Safety Game","Safe and Informative Conversations","Blackbox Agentic AI","LP Solvers","Announce Type","new Abstract","large language models","LLMs","safety requirements","a central challenge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Blackbox Agentic AI","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Safety Game":2.0,"Safe and Informative Conversations":2.0,"Blackbox Agentic AI":2.0,"LP Solvers":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"safety requirements":1.0,"a central challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7664250133333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.9635,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5927,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8194,"joy":0.0201,"surprise":0.0119,"sadness":0.03,"fear":0.059,"anger":0.0452,"disgust":0.0144},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel method for aligning LLMs with safety requirements using a black-box approach.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_de077264d7d8","title":"Localist LLMs -","content":"arXiv:2510.09338v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.728532","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Joachim Diederich","raw_content_length":1275,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["LLMs - arXiv:2510.09338v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1274,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Localist LLMs","arXiv251009338v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a novel framework","large language models","continuously adjustable internal representations","the full spectrum","localist","generalizable efficient encodings","The key innovation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Localist LLMs","large language models"],"business_innovation":["The key innovation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Localist LLMs":2.0,"arXiv251009338v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a novel framework":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"continuously adjustable internal representations":1.0,"the full spectrum":1.0,"localist":1.0,"generalizable efficient encodings":1.0,"The key innovation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7664848788888885,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2405,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8481,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7818,"joy":0.0851,"surprise":0.1087,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0105,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework for training LLMs with adjustable internal representations.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e0c9bebfbbc5","title":"Enhancing Infrared Vision: Progressive Prompt Fusion Network and Benchmark","content":"arXiv:2510.09343v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details, but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a notable 8.76\\% improvement.

Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\\footnote\\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method.

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09350","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.731303","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Vu Duc Anh Nguyen, Ziyue Li","raw_content_length":1611,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Graph Neural Networks","GAT"],"persons":["Deep Learning"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1610,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Deep Learning","the Spatio","arXiv251009350v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","The operational efficiency","railway networks","a cornerstone","modern economies","the cascading effects"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Deep Learning":2.0,"the Spatio":2.0,"arXiv251009350v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The operational efficiency":1.0,"railway networks":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0,"modern economies":1.0,"the cascading effects":1.0}},"age_hours":2.766591826388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6434,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0353,"sadness":0.0685,"fear":0.1952,"anger":0.0347,"disgust":0.018},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework for train delay forecasting using deep learning, specifically a Graph Attention Network (GAT).

We first investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in large-scale models without costly post-training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09354","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.732470","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Yunxiang Zhang, Muhammad Khalifa, Lechen Zhang, Xin Liu, Ayoung Lee, Xinliang Frederick Zhang, Farima Fatahi Bayat, Lu Wang","raw_content_length":1470,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ThinkLogit","Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training arXiv:2510.09354v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1469,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Logit Arithmetic Elicits","Long Reasoning Capabilities","Training","arXiv251009354v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Large reasoning models","thought","strategies","backtracking"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Training"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Logit Arithmetic Elicits":2.0,"Long Reasoning Capabilities":2.0,"Training":2.0,"arXiv251009354v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large reasoning models":1.0,"thought":1.0,"strategies":1.0,"backtracking":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7666376227777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9282,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0276,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.0136,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (ThinkLogit) for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models without additional training.

However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textit{N}atural \\textit{L}anguage to \\textit{Gen}erative \\textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework.

Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs. Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the \"overthinking\" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
