With team semantics, LTL is able to express hyperproperties, which have in the last decade been identified as a key concept in the verification of information flow properties. We study basic properties of the logic and classify the computational complexity of its satisfiability, path, and model checking problem. Further, we examine how extensions of the basic logic react to adding additional atomic operators. Finally, we compare its expressivity to the one of HyperLTL, another recently introduced logic for hyperproperties. Our results show that LTL with team semantics is a viable alternative to HyperLTL, which complements the expressivity of HyperLTL and has partially better algorithmic properties. For CTL with team semantics, we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete while we show that model checking is PSPACE-complete.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18667","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.098576","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cslo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Andreas Krebs, Arne Meier, Jonni Virtema, Martin Zimmermann","raw_content_length":1169,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CTL","Computation Tree Logic","Temporal Logics arXiv:2409.18667v2 Announce Type","LTL","Linear Temporal Logic"],"persons":[],"locations":["HyperLTL"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1164,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Synchronous Team Semantics","Temporal Logics","team semantics","LTL","arXiv240918667v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the most important linear","time specification languages","CTL","hyperproperties"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Synchronous Team Semantics":2.0,"Temporal Logics":2.0,"team semantics":2.0,"LTL":2.0,"arXiv240918667v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the most important linear":1.0,"time specification languages":1.0,"CTL":1.0,"hyperproperties":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763619690277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3580000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2716,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8991,"joy":0.0285,"surprise":0.0502,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0085,"disgust":0.0025},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical advancements in temporal logics, specifically LTL and CTL with team semantics.

Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a pre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the intersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT). PEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT (i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses privacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model during the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very few on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both parameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the PrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled privacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively speaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to collaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner in detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy protection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications and formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while maximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA bandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource allocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised to solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy requirements.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00433","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.099005","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Yang Li, Wenhan Yu, Jun Zhao","raw_content_length":1877,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.295,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Homomorphic Encryption","PrivTuner","the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient","PPFT","Parameter-Efficient","Privacy-Preserving FT"],"persons":["LoRA","P3EFT"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1876,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Homomorphic Encryption","LoRA","Privacy-Preserving Parameter","arXiv241000433v3 Announce Type","AI foundation models","impressive capabilities","a wide range","tasks","Fine-tuning FT","a method"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI foundation models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Homomorphic Encryption":2.0,"LoRA":2.0,"Privacy-Preserving Parameter":2.0,"arXiv241000433v3 Announce Type":1.0,"AI foundation models":1.0,"impressive capabilities":1.0,"a wide range":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"Fine-tuning FT":1.0,"a method":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763636548611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8198,"joy":0.0347,"surprise":0.0166,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.0714,"anger":0.0353,"disgust":0.0184},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach (PrivTuner) to privacy-preserving and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of AI models.

We present Debate, Deliberate, Decide (D3), a cost-aware, adversarial multi-agent framework that orchestrates structured debate among role-specialized agents (advocates, a judge, and an optional jury) to produce reliable and interpretable evaluations. D3 instantiates two complementary protocols: (1) Multi-Advocate One-Round Evaluation (MORE), which elicits k parallel defenses per answer to amplify signal via diverse advocacy, and (2) Single-Advocate Multi-Round Evaluation (SAMRE) with budgeted stopping, which iteratively refines arguments under an explicit token budget and convergence checks. We develop a probabilistic model of score gaps that (i) characterizes reliability and convergence under iterative debate and (ii) explains the separation gains from parallel advocacy. Under mild assumptions, the posterior distribution of the round-r gap concentrates around the true difference and the probability of mis-ranking vanishes; moreover, aggregating across k advocates provably increases expected score separation. We complement theory with a rigorous experimental suite across MT-Bench, AlignBench, and AUTO-J, showing state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments (accuracy and Cohen's kappa), reduced positional and verbosity biases via anonymization and role diversification, and a favorable cost-accuracy frontier enabled by budgeted stopping.

Recent GS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in real-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS representation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges that must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics. Specifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using range-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Representation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit mesh or implicit NeRF.

However, these models can inadvertently learn and retain sensitive information and harmful content during training, raising significant ethical and legal concerns. To address these issues, machine unlearning has been introduced as a potential solution. While existing unlearning methods take into account the specific characteristics of LLMs, they often suffer from high computational demands, limited applicability, or the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight behavioral unlearning framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. By modifying the external knowledge base of RAG, we simulate the effects of forgetting without directly interacting with the unlearned LLM. We approach the construction of unlearned knowledge as a constrained optimization problem, deriving two key components that underpin the effectiveness of RAG-based unlearning. This RAG-based approach is particularly effective for closed-source LLMs, where existing unlearning methods often fail. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama-2-7b-chat, and PaLM 2. The results demonstrate that our approach meets five key unlearning criteria: effectiveness, universality, harmlessness, simplicity, and robustness.

In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in robotics, particularly in robotic manipulation, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield single-task robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot for any object within the same category in any environment. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling in imitation learning. By collecting data across numerous environments and objects, we study how a policy's generalization performance changes with the number of training environments, objects, and demonstrations. Throughout our research, we collect over 40,000 demonstrations and execute more than 15,000 real-world robot rollouts under a rigorous evaluation protocol. Our findings reveal several intriguing results: the generalization performance of the policy follows a roughly power-law relationship with the number of environments and objects.

While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints. In this paper, we propose Neuralink, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Neuralink leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize I/O efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Neuralink achieves on average $1.49\\times$ improvements in end-to-end latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Neuralink explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design for LLM inference.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19274","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.102750","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","csos","cspf","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Tuowei Wang, Ruwen Fan, Minxing Huang, Zixu Hao, Kun Li, Ting Cao, Youyou Lu, Yaoxue Zhang, Ju Ren","raw_content_length":1677,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Neuron Co-Activation","IOPS","Neuron Co arXiv:2410.19274v3","DRAM"],"persons":["Neuralink"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1674,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Neuralink","Fast LLM Inference","Smartphones","Neuron Co","LLMs","arXiv241019274v3 Announce Type","Large Language Models","remarkable success","various domains","them"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fast LLM Inference","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Neuralink":2.0,"Fast LLM Inference":2.0,"Smartphones":2.0,"Neuron Co":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv241019274v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"remarkable success":1.0,"various domains":1.0,"them":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763771443888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.874,"joy":0.0077,"surprise":0.0405,"sadness":0.0312,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0153,"disgust":0.0243},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach (Neuralink) to improve LLM inference on smartphones, potentially reducing energy consumption by optimizing memory access.

However, relevant literature mostly focuses on subsystems and parts, rather than full airframes. In structural dynamics, modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes, from any structure are the main building blocks of vibration-based damage detection. However, traditional comparisons of these parameters are often ambiguous in complex systems, complicating damage detection and assessment. The modified total modal assurance criterion (MTMAC), an index well-known in the field of finite element model updating, is extended to address this challenge and is proposed as an index for damage identification and severity assessment. To support the requirement for precise and robust modal identification of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the improved Loewner Framework (iLF), known for its reliability and computational performance, is pioneeringly employed within SHM. Since the MTMAC is proposed solely as a damage identification and severity assessment index, the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC), also a well-established tool, but for damage localisation using mode shapes, is used for completeness. The iLF SHM capabilities are validated through comparisons with traditional methods, including least-squares complex exponential and stochastic subspace identification with canonical variate analysis on a numerical case study of a cantilever beam. Furthermore, the MTMAC is validated against the traditional vibration-based approach, which involves directly comparing natural frequencies and mode shapes. Finally, an experimental dataset from a BAE Systems Hawk T1A jet trainer ground vibration test is used to demonstrate the iLF and MTMAC capabilities on a real-life, real-size SHM problem, showing their effectiveness in detecting and assessing damage.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20160","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.103573","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Gabriele Dessena, Marco Civera, Andr\\'es Marcos, Bernardino Chiaia, Oscar E.

However, they are also known to be brittle and biased against marginalised communities and dialects. This requires their applications to high-stakes tasks like hate speech detection to be critically scrutinized. In this work, we investigate the robustness of hate speech classification using LLMs particularly when explicit and implicit markers of the speaker's ethnicity are injected into the input. For explicit markers, we inject a phrase that mentions the speaker's linguistic identity. For the implicit markers, we inject dialectal features. By analysing how frequently model outputs flip in the presence of these markers, we reveal varying degrees of brittleness across 3 LLMs and 1 LM and 5 linguistic identities. We find that the presence of implicit dialect markers in inputs causes model outputs to flip more than the presence of explicit markers. Further, the percentage of flips varies across ethnicities. Finally, we find that larger models are more robust.

Credibility assessment relies on aggregating diverse credibility signals - small units of information, such as content subjectivity, bias, or a presence of persuasion techniques - into a final credibility label/score. However, current research in automatic credibility assessment and credibility signals detection remains highly fragmented, with many signals studied in isolation and lacking integration. Notably, there is a scarcity of approaches that detect and aggregate multiple credibility signals simultaneously. These challenges are further exacerbated by the absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of research works that connects these research efforts under a common framework and identifies shared trends, challenges, and open problems. In this survey, we address this gap by presenting a systematic and comprehensive literature review of 175 research papers, focusing on textual credibility signals within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which undergoes a rapid transformation due to advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). While positioning the NLP research into the the broader multidisciplinary landscape, we examine both automatic credibility assessment methods as well as the detection of nine categories of credibility signals.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_7fc1c487b098","title":"EROAS: 3D Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance System for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles using 2.5D Forward","content":"arXiv:2411.05516v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have advanced significantly in obstacle detection and path planning through sonar, cameras, and learning-based methods. However, safe and efficient navigation in cluttered environments remains challenging due to partial observability, turbidity, the limited field-of-view of forward-looking sonar (FLS), and occlusions that obscure obstacle geometry. To address these issues, we propose the Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance Strategy (EROAS), a lightweight framework that augments a standard 2D FLS with a pivoting mechanism, effectively transforming it into a cost-efficient \\emph{2.5D sonar}. This design provides vertical information on demand, extending situational awareness while minimizing computational overhead. EROAS integrates three complementary modules: first, Sonar Profile-guided Directional Decision Control (SPD2C) for rapid gap detection and generation of reference commands in both horizontal and vertical planes. Secondly, the Spatial Context Generator (SCG), which maintains a short-term obstacle memory of the past to mitigate partial observability, and finally, a Spatio-Temporal Control Barrier Function (ST-CBF) that enforces forward-invariance of safety constraints by filtering nominal references. Together, these components enable robust, reactive avoidance of obstacles in uncertain and cluttered 3D underwater settings. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed EROAS algorithm, demonstrating improved trajectory efficiency, reduced travel time, and enhanced safety compared to conventional methods such as the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and Artificial Potential Fields (APF). https://github.com/AIRLabIISc/EROAS","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05516","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.105196","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Pruthviraj Mane, Allen Jacob George, Rajini Makam, Subhash Gurikar, Rudrashis Majumder, Suresh Sundaram","raw_content_length":1790,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["3D Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance System","the Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance Strategy","FLS"],"persons":["Sonar Profile-guided"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1789,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Autonomous Underwater Vehicles","EROAS","3D Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance System","Forward","Announce Type","AUVs","obstacle detection","path","sonar","cameras"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles":3.0,"EROAS":2.0,"3D Efficient Reactive Obstacle Avoidance System":2.0,"Forward":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"AUVs":1.0,"obstacle detection":1.0,"path":1.0,"sonar":1.0,"cameras":1.0}},"age_hours":2.763857589166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7691,"joy":0.0082,"surprise":0.0239,"sadness":0.0195,"fear":0.1561,"anger":0.0166,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel obstacle avoidance system for AUVs, demonstrating improved trajectory efficiency and reduced travel time in simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments compared to conventional methods.

However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. We address this bottleneck by developing a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate of a spatially and demographically resolved mechanistic metapopulation simulator. This combined approach advances classical machine learning approaches which are often black box. Our design of experiments spans outbreak and persistent-threat regimes, up to three contact change points, and age-structured contact matrices on a 400-node spatial graph. We benchmark multiple GNN layers and identify an ARMAConv-based architecture that offers a strong accuracy-runtime trade-off. Across 30-90 day horizons and up to three contact change points, the surrogate attains 10-27 % mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) while delivering (near) constant runtime with respect to the forecast horizon. Our approach accelerates evaluation by up to 28,670 times compared with the mechanistic model, allowing responsive decision support in time-critical scenarios and straightforward web integration.

In particular, within the framework of interpolatory tensorial reduced order models (ROM), LRTD is computed for tensors composed of snapshots of the system's solutions, where each parameter corresponds to a distinct tensor mode. This approach requires full sampling of the parameter domain on a tensor product grid, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it practical only for systems with a small number of parameters. To overcome this limitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a low-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem is formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes correspond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes correspond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor completion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid tensor train. Completion in this format is then integrated into an interpolatory tensorial ROM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both the completion method and the ROM on several examples of dynamical systems derived from finite element discretizations of parabolic partial differential equations with parameter-dependent coefficients or boundary conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07151","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.106007","language":"en","tags":["physicscomp-ph","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Alexander V.

The latter allows one to exploit the dissipation of the free energy in an optimal way, which is an entirely new approach.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \\textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \\textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness.

Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15702","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.109140","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","csni","research","mathit","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Bin Chen, Wenbo Yu, Qinshan Zhang, Tianqu Zhuang, Yong Jiang, Shu-Tao Xia","raw_content_length":1604,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Editable-DeepSC","Semantic Facial Editing"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1603,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv241115702v3 Announce Type","Real-time computer vision","a crucial role","various real-world applications","whose performance","communication networks","the data-oriented characteristics","conventional communications","the special needs","real-time CV tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Real-time computer vision"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv241115702v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Real-time computer vision":1.0,"a crucial role":1.0,"various real-world applications":1.0,"whose performance":1.0,"communication networks":1.0,"the data-oriented characteristics":1.0,"conventional communications":1.0,"the special needs":1.0,"real-time CV tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7640043391666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.063,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8126,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9392,"joy":0.0151,"surprise":0.0258,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.003,"anger":0.0055,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper proposes a novel approach (Editable-DeepSC) for semantic facial editing to save transmission bandwidth.

However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9843dc455246","title":"FairDD: Fair Dataset Distillation","content":"arXiv:2411.19623v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches (DDs), requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DDs, with a promising trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach.

However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of data, but this is not the case in closed-loop evaluation. The inconsistency between the two assessments shifts our focus toward the distribution of data rather than merely expanding its volume.

This is especially problematic when the environment is geometrically complex and/or features uneven energy absorption (e.g. coupled volumes), because in such cases the late reverberation is dependent on the sound sources' and listeners' positions, and therefore must be adapted to their movements in real time. We present a novel approach to the task, named modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART), which can handle highly complex scenarios with efficiency. The approach is based on the geometrical acoustics method of acoustic radiance transfer, from which we extract a set of energy decay modes and their positional relationships with sources and listeners. In this paper, we describe the physical and mathematical significance of MoD-ART, highlighting its advantages and applicability to different scenarios. Through an analysis of the method's computational complexity, we show that it compares very favorably with ray-tracing. We also present simulation results showing that MoD-ART can capture multiple decay slopes and flutter echoes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04534","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.112344","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","eessas","preprints","research","cssd","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Matteo Scerbo, Sebastian J.

Initially, each node knows only its own and its neighbors' identifiers, forming a local channel, while the evolving structure is termed the global channel. The goal is to reconfigure any connected graph into a desired topology, such as a bounded-degree expander graph or a well-formed tree (WFT) with a constant maximum degree and logarithmic diameter, minimizing the total number of rounds and message complexity. This problem mirrors real-world peer-to-peer network construction, where creating robust and efficient systems is desired. We study the overlay reconstruction problem in a network of $n$ nodes in two models: \\textsf{GOSSIP-reply}{} and \\textsf{HYBRID}{}. In the \\textsf{GOSSIP-reply}{} model, each node can send a message and receive a corresponding reply message in one round.

In both models, we propose protocols for WFT construction with $O\\left(n \\log n\\right)$ message complexities using messages of $O(\\log n)$ bits.

To address this, novel algorithms have been developed that mitigate overestimation bias by employing multiple Q-functions. Edge scenarios, which prioritize privacy, have recently gained prominence.

However, meticulously labeling an experimental dataset for training is often prohibitively expensive, while training models purely on synthetic data is risky due to the domain gap between simulated and experimental measurements. In this research, we demonstrate that supervised domain adaptation can substantially improve the performance of radioisotope identification models by transferring knowledge between synthetic and experimental data domains. We consider two domain adaptation scenarios: (1) a simulation-to-simulation adaptation, where we perform multi-label proportion estimation using simulated high-purity germanium detectors, and (2) a simulation-to-experimental adaptation, where we perform multi-class, single-label classification using measured spectra from handheld lanthanum bromide (LaBr) and sodium iodide (NaI) detectors. We begin by pretraining a spectral classifier on synthetic data using a custom transformer-based neural network. After subsequent fine-tuning on just 64 labeled experimental spectra, we achieve a test accuracy of 96% in the sim-to-real scenario with a LaBr detector, far surpassing a synthetic-only baseline model (75%) and a model trained from scratch (80%) on the same 64 spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-adapted models learn more human-interpretable features than experiment-only baseline models. Overall, our results highlight the potential for supervised domain adaptation techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap in radioisotope identification, enabling the development of accurate and explainable classifiers even in real-world scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07069","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.113570","language":"en","tags":["cslg","nucl-th","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Peter Lalor, Henry Adams, Alex Hagen","raw_content_length":1831,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LaBr","Sim arXiv:2412.07069v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1830,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sim","arXiv241207069v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Machine learning","the potential","the speed","reliability","radioisotope identification","gamma spectroscopy","an experimental dataset"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sim":2.0,"arXiv241207069v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Machine learning":1.0,"the potential":1.0,"the speed":1.0,"reliability":1.0,"radioisotope identification":1.0,"gamma spectroscopy":1.0,"an experimental dataset":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764169084444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.239,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6478,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2503,"joy":0.0219,"surprise":0.0074,"sadness":0.0101,"fear":0.6116,"anger":0.0641,"disgust":0.0345},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research demonstrates improved radioisotope identification using machine learning, achieving 96% test accuracy after fine-tuning on 64 labeled experimental spectra.

However, this paradigm necessitates the exchange of model parameters or gradients between peers. Such exchanges can be exploited to infer sensitive information about training data, which is achieved through privacy attacks (e.g., Membership Inference Attacks -- MIA). In order to devise effective defense mechanisms, it is important to understand the factors that increase/reduce the vulnerability of a given decentralized learning architecture to MIA. In this study, we extensively explore the vulnerability to MIA of various decentralized learning architectures by varying the graph structure (e.g., number of neighbors), the graph dynamics, and the aggregation strategy, across diverse datasets and data distributions. Our key finding, which to the best of our knowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is heavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each node upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing properties of the communication graph. We illustrate these results experimentally using four datasets and by theoretically analyzing the mixing properties of various decentralized architectures. We also empirically show that enhancing mixing properties is highly beneficial when combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as Differential Privacy. Our paper draws a set of lessons learned for devising decentralized learning systems that reduce by design the vulnerability to MIA.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12837","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.114350","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","csdc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Ousmane Touat, Jezekael Brunon, Yacine Belal, Julien Nicolas, Mohamed Maouche, C\\'esar Sabater, Sonia Ben Mokhtar","raw_content_length":1767,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Membership Inference Attacks","MIA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1766,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Vulnerability","Decentralized Learning","Membership Inference Attacks","the Lens","Graph Mixing","Announce Type","Abstract","The primary promise","decentralized learning","users"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Vulnerability":2.0,"Decentralized Learning":2.0,"Membership Inference Attacks":2.0,"the Lens":2.0,"Graph Mixing":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The primary promise":1.0,"decentralized learning":1.0,"users":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7641983672222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3798,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.0073,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.4506,"anger":0.0829,"disgust":0.0517},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores vulnerabilities in decentralized learning architectures, specifically regarding membership inference attacks.

Relying on the insight that real-world keyword detection often requires handling of diverse content, we propose a novel supervised keyword extraction approach based on the mixture of experts (MoE) technique. MoE uses a learnable routing sub-network to direct information to specialised experts, allowing them to specialise in distinct regions of the input space. SEKE, a mixture of Specialised Experts for supervised Keyword Extraction, uses DeBERTa as the backbone model and builds on the MoE framework, where experts attend to each token, by integrating it with a bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, to allow successful extraction even on smaller corpora, where specialisation is harder due to lack of training data. The MoE framework also provides an insight into inner workings of individual experts, enhancing the explainability of the approach.

While recent work demonstrates that LLMs can be aligned with diverse human perspectives, evaluating this alignment on downstream tasks (e.g., hate speech detection) remains challenging due to the use of inconsistent datasets across studies. To address this issue, in this resource paper we propose a two-step framework: we (1) introduce SubData, an open-source Python library designed for standardizing heterogeneous datasets to evaluate LLMs perspective alignment; and (2) present a theory-driven approach leveraging this library to test how differently-aligned LLMs (e.g., aligned with different political viewpoints) classify content targeting specific demographics. SubData's flexible mapping and taxonomy enable customization for diverse research needs, distinguishing it from existing resources. We illustrate its usage with an example application and invite contributions to extend our initial release into a multi-construct benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs perspective alignment on natural language processing tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16783","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.115536","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Pietro Bernardelle, Leon Fr\\\"ohling, Stefano Civelli, Gianluca Demartini","raw_content_length":1212,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.795,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SubData"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1211,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SubData","Bridging Heterogeneous Datasets","Theory","LLMs","arXiv241216783v3 Announce Type","Abstract","As increasingly capable large language models","emerge","researchers","their potential"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","As increasingly capable large language models"],"research_academic":["researchers"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SubData":2.0,"Bridging Heterogeneous Datasets":2.0,"Theory":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv241216783v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"As increasingly capable large language models":1.0,"emerge":1.0,"researchers":1.0,"their potential":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764241696944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.36,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7858,"joy":0.0075,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.0111,"fear":0.1114,"anger":0.0362,"disgust":0.0245},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a library for standardizing datasets used in LLM alignment research.

The numerical method belongs to the class of Eulerian unfitted finite element methods. It employs a cutFEM discretization in space and a standard BDF time-stepping scheme, enabled by a discrete extension of the solution from the physical domain into the ambient space using ghost-penalty stabilization. To investigate the origin of spurious temporal pressure oscillations, we revisit a finite element stability analysis for the steady domain case and extend it to derive a stability estimate for the pressure in the $L^\\infty(L^2)$-norm that is uniform with respect to discretization parameters. By identifying where the arguments fail in the context of a moving domain, we propose a variant of the method that ensures unconditional stability of the instantaneous pressure. As a result, the modified method eliminates spurious pressure oscillations. We also present extensive numerical studies aimed at illustrating our findings and exploring the effects of fluid viscosity, geometry approximation, mass conservation, discretization and stabilization parameters, and the choice of finite element spaces on the occurrence and magnitude of spurious temporal pressure oscillations. The results of the experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17657","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.116301","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Maxim Olshanskii, Henry von Wahl","raw_content_length":1617,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BDF"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1616,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Stability","instantaneous pressures","an Eulerian finite element method","boundary flow problems","arXiv241217657v2 Announce Type","Abstract","This paper","the cause","a remedy","the problem"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Stability":2.0,"instantaneous pressures":2.0,"an Eulerian finite element method":2.0,"boundary flow problems":2.0,"arXiv241217657v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the cause":1.0,"a remedy":1.0,"the problem":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764270274166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5449999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.891,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8719,"joy":0.0307,"surprise":0.0416,"sadness":0.0232,"fear":0.0109,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a numerical method for simulating incompressible flow problems, which could be relevant to optimizing fluid dynamics in various engineering applications, including renewable energy systems or energy-efficient transportation.

The proposed auction integrates multiple essential goals such as maximizing social welfare as well as accelerating the decision-making process from both short-term and long-term views, (e.g., the time for determining winning seller-buyer pairs), by introducing a stagewise strategy: an overbooking-driven pre-double auction (OPDAuction) for determining long-term cooperations between sellers and buyers before practical resource transactions as Stage I, and a real-time backup double auction (RBDAuction) for quickly coping with residual resource demands during actual transactions. In particular, by embedding a proper overbooking rate, OPDAuction helps with facilitating trading contracts between appropriate sellers and buyers as guidance for future transactions, by allowing the booked resources to exceed theoretical supply. Then, since pre-auctions may cause risks, our RBDAuction adjusts to real-time market changes, further enhancing the overall social welfare. More importantly, we offer an interesting view to show that our proposed two-stage auction can support significant design properties such as truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget balance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate good performance in social welfare, time efficiency, and computational scalability, outstripping conventional methods in dynamic edge computing settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04507","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.117184","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csdc","csgt","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Sicheng Wu, Minghui Liwang, Deqing Wang, Xianbin Wang, Chao Wu, Junyi Tang, Li Li, Xiaoyu Xia","raw_content_length":1772,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OPDAuction","RBDAuction"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1771,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","Abstract","responsive and cost-effective computing service delivery","edge networks","this paper","a novel two-stage double auction methodology","an interesting idea","dynamic and uncertain nature","supply","edge servers"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["dynamic and uncertain nature"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"responsive and cost-effective computing service delivery":1.0,"edge networks":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"a novel two-stage double auction methodology":1.0,"an interesting idea":1.0,"dynamic and uncertain nature":1.0,"supply":1.0,"edge servers":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7642963119444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2955,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8591,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.587,"joy":0.0381,"surprise":0.0251,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.2908,"anger":0.0416,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel auction methodology for edge computing resource allocation, aiming to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04765","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.117608","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Felix Krause, Timy Phan, Ming Gui, Stefan Andreas Baumann, Vincent Tao Hu, Bj\\\"orn Ommer","raw_content_length":1648,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1647,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Efficient Architecture","these models","arXiv250104765v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Diffusion models","the mainstream approach","visual generation","sample inefficiency","high training costs","methods"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the mainstream approach"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Efficient Architecture":2.0,"these models":2.0,"arXiv250104765v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Diffusion models":1.0,"the mainstream approach":1.0,"visual generation":1.0,"sample inefficiency":1.0,"high training costs":1.0,"methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7643106722222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.5225,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1045,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7816,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0194,"sadness":0.0862,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0307,"disgust":0.0641},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (TREAD) for improving the training efficiency of diffusion models, leading to reduced computational cost.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9eda80891a73","title":"Motion Tracks: A Unified Representation for Human","content":"arXiv:2501.06994v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Teaching robots to autonomously complete everyday tasks remains a challenge. Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks, capture the predicted direction of motion for either human hands or robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-pi) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-pi completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations.

We use a detailed analysis of the reactivity of the non-spatial and spatial dynamics, stability analyses, and numerical continuation to uncover detailed aspects of this system's pattern-forming potential. In addition to patterning in Turing unstable parameter regimes, reactivity of the spatial system can itself lead to a range of parameters where a spatially uniform state is asymptotically stable, but exhibits transient growth that can induce pattern formation. We show that this occurs in the bistable region of a subcritical Turing bifurcation. Intriguingly, such bistable regions appear in two spatial dimensions, but not in a one-dimensional domain, suggesting important interplays between geometry, transient growth, and the emergence of multistable patterns. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the bacterial soil organic carbon system, as well as for reaction-transport modeling more generally.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08757","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.119157","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Fasma Diele, Andrew L.

First, we present an almost global continuous distributed attitude synchronization scheme with rigorously proven stability guarantees. Thereafter, we propose two global distributed hybrid attitude synchronization schemes on SO(3). The first scheme is a hybrid control law that leverages angular velocities and relative orientations to achieve global alignment to a common orientation. The second scheme eliminates the dependence on angular velocities by introducing dynamic auxiliary variables, while ensuring global asymptotic attitude synchronization. This velocity-free control scheme relies exclusively on attitude information. The proposed schemes are applicable to heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents may have distinct inertia matrices.

SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures. Our results provide fresh perspectives on designing spiking Transformers to advance their sequential modeling capability, thereby expanding their applicability across various domains.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16745","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.119969","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","research","csne","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":265,"author":"Changze Lv, Yansen Wang, Dongqi Han, Yifei Shen, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang, Dongsheng Li","raw_content_length":1970,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.325,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1969,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Relative Positional Encoding","Spiking Transformers","SNNs","various tasks","arXiv250116745v3","Announce Type","Abstract","neural networks","bio-inspired networks","neurons"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Spiking Transformers","neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Relative Positional Encoding":2.0,"Spiking Transformers":2.0,"SNNs":2.0,"various tasks":2.0,"arXiv250116745v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"neural networks":1.0,"bio-inspired networks":1.0,"neurons":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7643985480555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.716000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9432,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8751,"joy":0.0194,"surprise":0.0771,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0127,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces novel methods for relative positional encoding in spiking neural networks (SNNs), aiming to improve their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities.

Recent research has illuminated how Transformers perform ICL, showing that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent for linear least-squares objectives when trained on random linear regression tasks. Building on this, we investigate ICL for nonlinear function classes. We first prove that LSA is inherently incapable of outperforming linear predictors on nonlinear tasks, underscoring why prior solutions cannot readily extend to these problems. To overcome this limitation, we analyze a Transformer block consisting of LSA and feed-forward layers inspired by the gated linear units (GLU), which is a standard component of modern Transformers. We show that this block achieves nonlinear ICL by implementing one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression loss. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the expressivity of a single block is inherently limited by its dimensions. We then show that a deep Transformer can overcome this bottleneck by distributing the computation of richer kernel functions across multiple blocks, performing block-coordinate descent in a high-dimensional feature space that a single block cannot represent. Our findings highlight that the feed-forward layers provide a crucial and scalable mechanism by which Transformers can express nonlinear representations for ICL.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18187","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.120373","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Haoyuan Sun, Ali Jadbabaie, Navid Azizan","raw_content_length":1596,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear","ICL","LSA","Transformer","GLU"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1595,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Role","Transformer Feed","ICL","arXiv250118187v3","Announce Type","Abstract","Transformer-based models","a remarkable ability","context","unseen tasks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Role":2.0,"Transformer Feed":2.0,"ICL":2.0,"arXiv250118187v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Transformer-based models":1.0,"a remarkable ability":1.0,"context":1.0,"unseen tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.764413399722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.063,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8126,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7358,"joy":0.0214,"surprise":0.1976,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0164,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on improving the in-context learning capabilities of transformer models.

Traditional Gradual Domain Adaptation methods mitigate domain bias by introducing intermediate domains and self-training strategies, but often face the challenges of inefficient knowledge migration or missing data in intermediate domains. In this paper, we design an optimisation framework based on the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ by dynamically balancing the loss weights of the source and target domains, which enables the model to progressively adjust the strength of knowledge migration ($\\lambda$ incrementing from 0 to 1) during the training process, thus achieving cross-domain generalisation more efficiently. Specifically, the method incorporates self-training to generate pseudo-labels and iteratively updates the model by minimising a weighted loss function to ensure stability and robustness during progressive adaptation in the intermediate domain. The experimental part validates the effectiveness of the method on rotated MNIST, colour-shifted MNIST, portrait dataset and forest cover type dataset, and the results show that it outperforms existing baseline methods. The paper further analyses the impact of the dynamic tuning strategy of the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ on the performance through ablation experiments, confirming the advantages of progressive domain penetration in mitigating the domain bias and enhancing the model generalisation capability. The study provides a theoretical support and practical framework for asymptotic domain adaptation and expands its application potential in dynamic environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19159","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.121553","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Zixi Wang, Yubo Huang","raw_content_length":1787,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Gradual Domain Osmosis","GDO","Traditional Gradual Domain Adaptation"],"persons":["arXiv:2501.19159v3 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1786,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gradual Domain Osmosis","GDO","intermediate domains","arXiv250119159v3 Announce Type","Abstract","this paper","a new method","which","the problem","smooth knowledge migration"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Gradual Domain Osmosis"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gradual Domain Osmosis":3.0,"GDO":2.0,"intermediate domains":2.0,"arXiv250119159v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"a new method":1.0,"which":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"smooth knowledge migration":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7644535666666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.706,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4588,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.877,"joy":0.015,"surprise":0.0268,"sadness":0.0156,"fear":0.024,"anger":0.0302,"disgust":0.0113},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper presents a new method for gradual domain adaptation, which could potentially improve the efficiency of machine learning models in various applications, including those related to sustainability.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_afa6bc88b057","title":"$k$","content":"arXiv:2502.00320v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The emergence of modern compute infrastructure for iterative optimization has led to great interest in developing optimization-based approaches for a scalable computation of $k$-SVD, i.e., the $k\\geq 1$ largest singular values and corresponding vectors of a matrix of rank $d \\geq 1$. Despite lots of exciting recent works, all prior works fall short in this pursuit. Specifically, the existing results are either for the exact-parameterized (i.e., $k = d$) and over-parameterized (i.e., $k > d$) settings; or only establish local convergence guarantees; or use a step-size that requires problem-instance-specific oracle-provided information. In this work, we complete this pursuit by providing a gradient-descent method with a simple, universal rule for step-size selection (akin to pre-conditioning), that provably finds $k$-SVD for a matrix of any rank $d \\geq 1$. We establish that the gradient method with random initialization enjoys global linear convergence for any $k, d \\geq 1$. Our convergence analysis reveals that the gradient method has an attractive region, and within this attractive region, the method behaves like Heron's method (a.k.a. the Babylonian method). Our analytic results about the said attractive region imply that the gradient method can be enhanced by means of Nesterov's momentum-based acceleration technique. The resulting improved convergence rates match those of rather complicated methods typically relying on Lanczos iterations or variants thereof. We provide an empirical study to validate the theoretical results.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00320","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.121954","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","mathoc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Yassir Jedra, Devavrat Shah","raw_content_length":1605,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$k\\geq 1"]},"char_count":1604,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv250200320v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The emergence","modern compute infrastructure","iterative optimization","great interest","optimization-based approaches","a scalable computation"," the kgeq 1 largest singular values","corresponding vectors"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv250200320v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The emergence":1.0,"modern compute infrastructure":1.0,"iterative optimization":1.0,"great interest":1.0,"optimization-based approaches":1.0,"a scalable computation":1.0," the kgeq 1 largest singular values":1.0,"corresponding vectors":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7644693675,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.3405,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8681,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8406,"joy":0.0159,"surprise":0.091,"sadness":0.0335,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.0092,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel gradient-descent method for computing k-SVD, a fundamental problem in data analysis.

Existing methods either rely on comparatively expensive test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image datasets without multi-image supervision, which can limit image quality. We propose a simple approach to address these challenges. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. Using this dataset, we train an encoder-based model that incorporates fine-grained visual details from reference images via a shared attention mechanism. Finally, we propose an inference technique that normalizes text and image guidance vectors to mitigate overexposure issues in sampled images. Through extensive experiments, we show that our encoder-based model, trained on SynCD, and with the proposed inference algorithm, improves upon existing encoder-based methods on standard customization benchmarks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01720","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.122333","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscv","csgr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Nupur Kumari, Xi Yin, Jun-Yan Zhu, Ishan Misra, Samaneh Azadi","raw_content_length":1154,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Generating Multi-Image Synthetic Data"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1153,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Multi-Image Synthetic Data","Text","image","arXiv250201720v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Customization","users","new concepts","objects","them"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Multi-Image Synthetic Data":2.0,"Text":2.0,"image":2.0,"arXiv250201720v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Customization":1.0,"users":1.0,"new concepts":1.0,"objects":1.0,"them":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7644847130555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.939,"joy":0.0044,"surprise":0.0196,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for generating synthetic data to improve text-to-image models.
