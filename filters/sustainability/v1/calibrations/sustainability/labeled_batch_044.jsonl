There is a limited knowledge how integrating the Design Thinking philosophy into AI-driven marketing strategies can generate resilient marketing results for SMEs. The purpose of this research is to explore how integrating DT philosophy can improve and sustain the effectiveness of AI-driven marketing campaigns for SMEs. The author used a qualitatively driven mixed-data case study approach to develop a comprehensive understanding integrating AI-driven marketing and DT. Data were collected through interviews, performance metrics analysis, and document review within three SMEs. The results revealed that incorporating the DT philosophy into AI-driven marketing strategies is associated with marketing effectiveness for SMEs. Additionally, SMEs adopting this integration achieve greater customer engagement and interaction. The combination of DT and AI-driven marketing observed higher improvements than traditional approaches. These results are challenged due to the potential risk of bias, and the qualitative nature may present challenges in convincing readers accustomed to definitive and statistical results.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8994","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:27.209819","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Ioseb Gabelaia","raw_content_length":1282,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1282,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SMEs","Sustainability","Pages","The Relevance","challenges","their marketing strategies","measurable and sustainable effectiveness","resource-constrained business environments","a limited knowledge","the Design Thinking philosophy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SMEs":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Relevance":2.0,"challenges":1.0,"their marketing strategies":1.0,"measurable and sustainable effectiveness":1.0,"resource-constrained business environments":1.0,"a limited knowledge":1.0,"the Design Thinking philosophy":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72552308611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.924,"joy":0.0157,"surprise":0.0148,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0181,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0099},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a research study on integrating Design Thinking (DT) with AI-driven marketing strategies for SMEs.

By constructing a quantifiable index of involutionary competition intensity and matching it with corporation-level ESG scores, we document a statistically significant negative association between ESG performance and the degree of involutionary competition. Mechanism analysis reveals that ESG mitigates involutionary competition through two primary channels: (1) differentiation strategies that reduce price-based competition and product homogeneity, and (2) market-order regulation that curbs opportunistic behaviour and raises R&D efficiency. A modest price increase is shown to be revenue-enhancing; moreover, random-forest simulations indicate that counter-involutionary competition efforts amplify the market-share gains from cooperative R&D expenditures, accelerating post-adjustment revenue growth. This transition generates simultaneous increases in corporate profits and corporation value, breaking the previous price ceiling and establishing a sustainable development loop. The findings provide actionable insights for shifting the industry from low-level rivalry to sustainable value creation.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8998","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:27.210228","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Peiyuan Zhao","raw_content_length":1344,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Industry","ESG"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1318,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Involutionary Competition","Corporate ESG Adoption","Evidence","the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Industry","involutionary competition","This study","how corporate commitment","environmental social and governance ESG performance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Involutionary Competition":2.0,"Corporate ESG Adoption":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"the Consumer Electronics Manufacturing Industry":2.0,"involutionary competition":2.0,"This study":1.0,"how corporate commitment":1.0,"environmental social and governance ESG performance":1.0}},"age_hours":18.725537816944446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8447,"joy":0.0287,"surprise":0.0149,"sadness":0.0087,"fear":0.0566,"anger":0.0237,"disgust":0.0226},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study provides evidence of a negative association between ESG performance and involutionary competition in China's consumer electronics manufacturing industry.

This review provides the first structured attempt to apply LCC to marina infrastructure, addressing the lack of sector-specific models for pontoons, mooring systems, and marina operations. It also synthesizes research on LCC methodologies, challenges, and emerging trends relevant to coastal facilities, with a particular focus on pontoons, mooring systems, and marina management practices. Studies reveal persistent barriers to effective implementation, including fragmented data systems, inconsistent regulations, and limited sector-specific tools. Existing models, largely adapted from other construction contexts, often overlook the unique technical, environmental, and operational demands of marine assets. The review critically examines international standards, procurement frameworks, and methodological approaches, highlighting opportunities to integrate sustainability considerations and address gaps in cost forecasting. It also identifies the need for standardized data collection practices and risk-based maintenance strategies tailored to harsh marine environments. By mapping current knowledge and methodological limitations, this work provides a foundation for developing more accurate, sector-specific LCC models and guidance. This literature review contributes to the advancement of sustainable coastal infrastructure planning by consolidating scattered research, emphasizing knowledge gaps, and outlining priorities for future studies, supporting policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking to optimize investment decisions in marinas and related facilities.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8996","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:27.210848","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Martina Gudac Cvelic","raw_content_length":1804,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1804,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","The Role","the Built Environment","Sustainable Development","A Life Cycle Cost Perspective","Life cycle cost LCC analysis","a key tool","the long-term economic and environmental performance","built assets"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Sustainable Development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"The Role":2.0,"the Built Environment":2.0,"Sustainable Development":2.0,"A Life Cycle Cost Perspective":2.0,"Life cycle cost LCC analysis":1.0,"a key tool":1.0,"the long-term economic and environmental performance":1.0,"built assets":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72557071972222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9202,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.0238,"sadness":0.0119,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.0146,"disgust":0.0154},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reviews the application of Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis to marina infrastructure, highlighting the need for sector-specific models.

Based on the supply chain (SC) under the “agricultural product cooperative + live-streaming e-commerce” model, and in accordance with previous research, combined with the differences in the dominant role and the bearers of profit and loss in the SC. By applying Stackelberg game theory, different types of decisions are analyzed and solved. The research results show: (1) Centralized decision-making has advantages in terms of traceability level and SC profit performance. (2) In non-centralized decision-making models, when manufacturers bear negative evaluation losses and retailers act as the leaders of the SC, the overall decision-making effect is more ideal. When manufacturers or retailers act as the leaders of the SC and both bear the traceability costs, the decision-making effect is basically the same. (3) The traceability level sensitivity coefficient and the traceability level effect on traceability both have positive effects on the growth of SC profits and the improvement of the traceability level. (4) The maximization of profits for both parties can be achieved through the coordination of contracts.

Evidence from Chinese Listed Companies","content":"Productivity has long been the fundamental driver of human social progress and national prosperity. Against the backdrop of technological advancement and social development, New Quality Productive Forces (NQPFs) have emerged as a new form of productivity, serving as a key focus for corporate transformation and upgrading as well as sustainable national development. Based on the panel data of 28,107 listed companies in China from 2011 to 2022, this study employs a three-way fixed-effects model to investigate the impact of green finance (GF) on corporate NQPFs. The main findings are as follows: First, GF exhibits a significant positive correlation with the enhancement of corporate NQPFs.

This paper presents a scoping review of 58 peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 that examine the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in strengthening infrastructure resilience, with transportation systems adopted as the strategic case. The review classifies applications along five dimensions: technological approach, infrastructure sector, transportation linkage, resilience/security aspect, and key research gaps. Findings show that AI, machine learning (ML), and the Internet of Things (IoT) dominate current applications, particularly in predictive maintenance, intelligent monitoring, early-warning systems, and optimization. These applications extend beyond transport to energy, water, and agri-food systems that indirectly sustain transport resilience. Persistent challenges include affordability, data scarcity, infrastructural limitations, and limited real-world validation, especially in Sub-Saharan African contexts. The paper synthesizes cross-sector pathways through which AI enhances transport resilience and outlines practical implications for policymakers and practitioners. A targeted research agenda is also proposed to address methodological gaps, enhance deployment in resource-constrained settings, and promote hybrid and explainable AI for trust and scalability.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8992","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:27.211843","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Lamine Dieng","raw_content_length":1500,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Practice Transportation","IoT","Artificial Intelligence for Infrastructure Resilience: Transportation Systems","Artificial Intelligence (AI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1500,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Artificial Intelligence","Sustainability","Pages","Infrastructure Resilience","Transportation Systems","a Strategic Case","Policy","Practice","Transportation networks","critical lifelines"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Artificial Intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Artificial Intelligence":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Infrastructure Resilience":2.0,"Transportation Systems":2.0,"a Strategic Case":2.0,"Policy":2.0,"Practice":2.0,"Transportation networks":1.0,"critical lifelines":1.0}},"age_hours":18.725618645833336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.1420000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3716,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6174,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0185,"sadness":0.0109,"fear":0.2875,"anger":0.0342,"disgust":0.0252},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper reviews existing research on AI applications in transportation resilience.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_15c256be727c","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 8990: Influence of Stress on Gas Sorption Behavior and Induced Swelling in Coal: Implications for Sustainable CO2 Geological Storage","content":"The influence of stress on gas sorption behavior and sorption-induced swelling in coal is critical for the success of CO2-enhanced coalbed methane recovery (CO2-ECBM) and geological carbon sequestration—a key strategy for mitigating climate change and promoting clean energy transitions. However, this influence remains insufficiently understood, largely due to experimental limitations (e.g., overreliance on powdered coal samples) and conflicting theoretical frameworks in existing studies. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates the effects of two distinct stress constraints—constant confining pressure and constant volume—on CO2 adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics, and associated swelling deformation of intact anthracite coal cores. An integrated experimental apparatus was custom-designed for this study, combining volumetric sorption measurement with high-resolution strain monitoring via the confining fluid displacement (CFD) method and the confining pressure response (CPR) method. This setup enables the quantification of CO2–coal interactions under precisely controlled stress environments. Key findings reveal that stress conditions exert a regulatory role in shaping CO2–coal behavior: constant confining pressure conditions enhance CO2 adsorption capacity and sustain adsorption kinetics by accommodating matrix swelling, thereby preserving pore accessibility for continuous gas uptake. In contrast, constant volume constraints lead to rapid internal stress buildup, which inhibits further gas adsorption and accelerates the attainment of kinetic saturation. Sorption-induced swelling exhibits clear dependence on both pressure and constraint conditions. Elevated CO2 pressure leads to increased strain, while constant confining pressure facilitates more gradual, sustained expansion. This is particularly evident at higher pressures, where adsorption-induced swelling prevails over mechanical constraints. These results help resolve key discrepancies in the existing literature by clarifying the dual role of stress in modulating both pore accessibility (for gas transport) and mechanical response (for matrix deformation). These insights provide essential guidance for optimizing CO2 injection strategies and improving the long-term performance and sustainability of CO2-ECBM and geological carbon storage projects, ultimately supporting global efforts in carbon emission reduction and sustainable energy resource utilization.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8990","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:27.212254","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":311,"author":"Shaicheng Shen","raw_content_length":2521,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.555,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2471,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Influence","Stress","Gas Sorption Behavior","Induced Swelling","Coal","Implications","Sustainable CO2 Geological Storage","The influence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Influence":2.0,"Stress":2.0,"Gas Sorption Behavior":2.0,"Induced Swelling":2.0,"Coal":2.0,"Implications":2.0,"Sustainable CO2 Geological Storage":2.0,"The influence":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72563478888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6674,"joy":0.0116,"surprise":0.0074,"sadness":0.0206,"fear":0.1189,"anger":0.0645,"disgust":0.1096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":true},"reasoning":"This study presents experimental results on CO2 adsorption in coal under different stress conditions, providing insights into CO2-ECBM and geological carbon storage.

However, DIF’s impact on China’s 376 million migrants remains understudied, despite their significance for inclusive growth. This study provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of DIF–migrant entrepreneurship relationships using nationally representative data and multiple analytical approaches. Three key findings emerge: First, DIF significantly reduces entrepreneurship likelihood among migrant populations (marginal effect: −0.449, p < 0.01). Second, heterogeneity analysis reveals differential impacts across entrepreneurial motivations—specifically, inhibiting necessity-driven entrepreneurship (marginal effect: −0.426) while showing no significant impact on opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. Third, while DIF reduces overall entrepreneurial participation, it substantially enhances income levels and the employment scale of existing migrant entrepreneurs. Mechanism analysis reveals that DIF operates through expanding urban employment demand and raising wage levels, thereby increasing entrepreneurship’s opportunity cost for migrants. These findings provide evidence for leveraging digital finance to achieve SDG 8 (Decent Work) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) while ensuring equitable access to digital dividends for vulnerable populations.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/8991","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:27.212601","language":"en","tags":["environment","sustainability","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Sung Joon Yoon","raw_content_length":1476,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DIF’s","DIF","Social Sustainability: Examining Entrepreneurial Pathways","Digital Inclusive Finance"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1399,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DIF","Sustainability","Pages","Digital Inclusive Finance","Social Sustainability","Entrepreneurial Pathways","Performance","Chinas Migrant Population","Inclusive Growth","Digital inclusive finance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DIF":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Digital Inclusive Finance":2.0,"Social Sustainability":2.0,"Entrepreneurial Pathways":2.0,"Performance":2.0,"Chinas Migrant Population":2.0,"Inclusive Growth":2.0,"Digital inclusive finance":1.0}},"age_hours":18.725650246666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.3709999999999996,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4742,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8499,"joy":0.0199,"surprise":0.0345,"sadness":0.0117,"fear":0.0281,"anger":0.0245,"disgust":0.0314},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the impact of digital inclusive finance (DIF) on migrant entrepreneurship in China.

To address this, we develop the concept of the “Global Contents City,” a planning framework that integrates cultural exchange, creative industries, education, and tourism within a sustainable urban ecosystem. The research employs a qualitative methodology that combines theoretical review, comparative analysis of international precedents (e.g., Munich-Riem, Tempelhof, Stapleton, and Toronto), and design-oriented masterplanning. The findings highlight design strategies that spatially interconnect cultural, educational, industrial, and ecological functions while reinforcing low-carbon infrastructure and green open space.

It presents basic biological parameters of the species, including those that promote its synurbization—small habitat demands, omnivorism, as well as ecological, behavioral, and demographic flexibility. It also discusses intra-species transformations stemming from wild boar adaptation to the urban space and pinpoints habitat fragmentation, ecological restoration, and phenotypic flexibility as the underlying causes of people–wild boar interactions. These interactions are primarily negative because wild boars attack humans and domestic animals and cause many traffic accidents. An analysis of the literature included in this study shows that, unfortunately, there are currently no fully effective methods that could protect urban areas and their inhabitants from the threats posed by wild boars. In order for sustainable urban development policies to be effectively implemented, there is a need for intensive, holistic research and cooperation between experts in many fields: wildlife, economics, public health, sociology, ethics, psychology, and urban planning. The synurbanization of wild boars is a large and growing social problem, but from an ecological perspective, there is a need to take action and develop methods to mitigate human/wild animal conflicts, not only from a human perspective.

Given the limitations of existing research on load characteristic analysis and load forecasting during extreme weather events, this paper proposes a load-integrated forecasting model that accounts for extreme weather. First, an improved power load clustering method is proposed, combining Kernel PCA for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and an enhanced k-means algorithm, enabling both qualitative analysis and quantitative representation of load characteristics under extreme weather. Second, an optimal combination forecasting model is developed, integrating improved SVM and enhanced LSTM networks. Building upon the improved power load clustering algorithm, a load-integrated forecasting model considering extreme weather is established. Finally, based on the proposed load-integrated forecasting model, a time-series production simulation model considering extreme weather is constructed to quantitatively analyze the power and electricity balance risks of the system.

Traditional site selection methods rely heavily on manual experience, exhibiting strong subjectivity and difficulty in balancing multi-objective optimization. Existing heuristic algorithms suffer from slow convergence speeds and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, this paper constructs a multi-objective base station site selection model that simultaneously minimizes costs, maximizes coverage contributions, and minimizes interference. It achieves quantitative balance among objectives through normalization and weight fusion, while introducing constraints to ensure engineering feasibility. Concurrently, the genetic algorithm underwent targeted optimization by introducing an adaptive migration strategy based on population diversity and a cosine-type parameter adjustment strategy. This approach was integrated with the particle swarm optimization algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation while mitigating premature convergence. Experimental validation demonstrates that the improved algorithm achieves faster convergence and greater stability compared to traditional genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, while satisfying engineering constraints such as base station quantity, coverage, and interference. This research provides an efficient and feasible solution for intelligent base station site planning.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/3977","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.316327","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Shuya Zhang","raw_content_length":1547,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1547,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Communication Base Station Site Selection Method","an Improved Genetic Algorithm","the large-scale deployment","5G technology","the rationality","communication base station siting","network performance","construction costs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["an Improved Genetic Algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Communication Base Station Site Selection Method":2.0,"an Improved Genetic Algorithm":2.0,"the large-scale deployment":1.0,"5G technology":1.0,"the rationality":1.0,"communication base station siting":1.0,"network performance":1.0,"construction costs":1.0}},"age_hours":18.726969855,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7004,"joy":0.0079,"surprise":0.0187,"sadness":0.1246,"fear":0.0695,"anger":0.0323,"disgust":0.0468},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes an improved genetic algorithm for base station site selection, aiming to minimize costs, maximize coverage, and minimize interference.

The proposed technologies estimate statistical dependencies between moduli of harmonics of bearing defect frequencies. Moduli of harmonics of bearing defect frequencies, which appear due to bearing faults, are statistically dependent. The Third Order Modulus (TOM) is a novel higher order spectral signal processing technology developed for rotating machinery diagnostics. The paper presents mathematical expressions for new technologies as well as a detailed description of the signal processing algorithm of motor current for bearings diagnostics. The TOM technology is comprehensively validated via experimental trials for motor bearing diagnosis via motor current signature analysis. Results of experimental trials clearly show that the TOM technology is highly effective for diagnosis of bearing defects. Estimates of the total probabilities of correct diagnosis provided by the TOM technology are 100%. The TOM technology is experimentally compared with the classic bicoherence (CB) technology using eight bearings: four pristine bearings and four damaged bearings with two damage types.

However, the existing single-layer active noise control (ANC) filters may fail to attenuate the complicated harmonic noise, and the deep recursive ANC method may fail to work in real time. To solve the problem, in a bending-pipe model, a new hybrid adaptive self-loading filtered-x least-mean-square (ASL-FxLMS) and convolutional neural network-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) network is proposed. At first, based on the recursive GRU translation core, an improved CNN-GRU network with multi-head attention layers is proposed. Especially for complicated harmonic noises with more or fewer frequencies than harmonic models, the attenuation performance will be improved. In addition, its structure is optimized to decrease the computing load. In addition, an improved time-delay estimator is applied to improve the real-time ANC performance of CNN-GRU. Meanwhile, an adaptive self-loading FxLMS algorithm has been developed to deal with the uncertain components of complicated harmonic noise. Moreover, to achieve balance attenuation, robustness, and tracking performance, the ASL-FxLMS and CNN-GRU are connected by a convex combination structure. Furthermore, theoretical analysis and simulations are also conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6293","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.923652","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Zonglong Bai","raw_content_length":1364,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN","CNN-GRU","ANC"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1364,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","A New Hybrid Adaptive Self-Loading Filter","GRU","The air-conditioner noise","a rehabilitation room","the mental state","patients","ANC","the complicated harmonic noise"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["The air-conditioner noise"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A New Hybrid Adaptive Self-Loading Filter":2.0,"GRU":2.0,"The air-conditioner noise":1.0,"a rehabilitation room":1.0,"the mental state":1.0,"patients":1.0,"ANC":1.0,"the complicated harmonic noise":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72736247138889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7652,"joy":0.0039,"surprise":0.0279,"sadness":0.0846,"fear":0.0822,"anger":0.0187,"disgust":0.0175},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article proposes a new hybrid noise control system for air conditioners, which could potentially reduce energy consumption by optimizing AC operation.

Conventional clinical assessments may not adequately capture these deficiencies. This study investigated the gait and balance of elderly individuals with knee OA using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). Forty-four participants with Kellgren–Lawrence grade 2–3 knee OA (71.23 ± 5.75 years) and forty-five age-matched controls (70.87 ± 4.30 years) completed dynamic balance (balance board), static balance (single-leg stance), ‘timed up and go’ (TUG), and normal walking tasks. Between 2 and 8 IMUs, depending on the task, were placed on the head, chest, waist, knees, ankles, soles, and balance board to record kinematic data. Balance was quantified using absolute angular velocity and linear acceleration, with group differences analyzed by MANOVA and Bonferroni-adjusted univariate tests. The participants with knee OA exhibited greater gait asymmetry, although the difference was not significant. However, they consistently demonstrated higher absolute angular velocities than controls across most body segments during static and dynamic tasks, indicating reduced postural stability. No group differences were observed in TUG performance. These findings suggest that IMU-based measures, particularly angular velocity, are sensitive to balance impairment detection in knee OA. Incorporating IMU technology into clinical assessments may facilitate early identification of instability and guide targeted interventions to reduce fall risk.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6288","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.924953","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Fu-Cheng Wang","raw_content_length":1677,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Knee Osteoarthritis Using Inertial Measurement Units Knee","Kellgren–Lawrence"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["Elderly"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1615,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Assessment","Gait","Balance","Elderly Individuals","Knee Osteoarthritis Using Inertial Measurement Units","balance","Knee osteoarthritis","a prevalent condition"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Gait"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Assessment":2.0,"Gait":2.0,"Balance":2.0,"Elderly Individuals":2.0,"Knee Osteoarthritis Using Inertial Measurement Units":2.0,"balance":2.0,"Knee osteoarthritis":1.0,"a prevalent condition":1.0}},"age_hours":18.727427773888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7118,"joy":0.0064,"surprise":0.019,"sadness":0.08,"fear":0.1201,"anger":0.0114,"disgust":0.0513},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research using IMUs to assess gait and balance in elderly individuals with knee OA.

The present work demonstrates the combination of LFAs with centrifugal microfluidic platforms that allows for enhancement of LFAs’ sensitivity via the increase in the dwell time of the analyte at the test line as well as by passing a larger sample volume through the LFA strip. The rate of advancement of the liquid front in the radially positioned NC strip is retarded by the centrifugal force generated on spinning disc; therefore, the dwell time of the liquid front above the test line of LFA is increased. Additionally, integrating a waste reservoir enables passive replenishment of additional sample volume increases total probed volume by approximately 20% (from 50 μL to 60 μL). Comprehensive analysis, including COMSOL multiphysics simulation, was performed to deduce the importance of parameters such as channel height (100–300 μm), disc spin rate (0–2000 rpm), and reaction kinetics (fast vs. slow binding kinetics). The analysis was validated by the experimental observation of the slower-reacting CD79b protein on the test strip. For slower-reacting targets like CD79b, fluorescence intensity increased by ~40% compared to the static LFA. A new merit number, TRc (Transport Reaction Constant), is introduced, which refines the traditional Damköhler number (Da) by including the thickness of the liquid layer (such as the height of the microchannel), which affects the final sensitivity of the assays and is designed to reflect the role channel height plays for surface-based assays (in contrast to the bulk assays).","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6271","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.925998","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":261,"author":"Lawrence Kulinsky","raw_content_length":1753,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.305,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Mass Transport and Reaction Kinetics for Lateral Flow Immunoassay Integrated on Lab Lateral Flow Assays","LFA"],"persons":["Vol","LFA"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1693,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Interplay","the Mass Transport and Reaction Kinetics","Lateral Flow Immunoassay","Lab","LFAs","Lateral Flow Assays","ubiquitous test platforms","their affordability"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Interplay":2.0,"the Mass Transport and Reaction Kinetics":2.0,"Lateral Flow Immunoassay":2.0,"Lab":2.0,"LFAs":2.0,"Lateral Flow Assays":1.0,"ubiquitous test platforms":1.0,"their affordability":1.0}},"age_hours":18.727476230277777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.4885,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9276,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0239,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0062,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.0174},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a lab-based improvement to lateral flow assays using centrifugal microfluidics.

To effectively reduce the interference from static clutter during the perception process, clutter suppression algorithms such as Moving Target Indicator (MTI) have been developed. However, existing algorithms have problems such as residual clutter interference and high computational complexity. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes a circular fitting clutter suppression algorithm based on the integrated communication and perception system. This method can suppress static clutter using the circular fitting algorithm by leveraging different OFDM symbols on subcarriers based on the OFDM echo channel characteristics of drone targets and static environmental interference. Simulation results show that this method can effectively suppress static clutter and significantly improve the distinguishability of the range-Doppler (RD) spectrum of dynamic targets. In addition, an energy ratio is proposed to quantitatively compare the clutter suppression effects of various algorithms. The method in this paper, especially in the perception performance of low-speed group targets, outperforms existing methods and can solve the problem of interference from the static clutter environment to the perception of dynamic targets in existing technologies.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6285","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.926298","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Liu Liu","raw_content_length":1429,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UAVs","OFDM","MTI"],"persons":["Vol","Suppression Algorithm"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1429,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","ISAC","Low Altitude UAVs","the perception process","low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles","UAVs","strong static clutter","the ground","buildings"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"ISAC":2.0,"Low Altitude UAVs":2.0,"the perception process":2.0,"low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles":1.0,"UAVs":1.0,"strong static clutter":1.0,"the ground":1.0,"buildings":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72749204361111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8554,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0159,"sadness":0.0186,"fear":0.0515,"anger":0.031,"disgust":0.0218},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a new algorithm to improve the perception of low-altitude UAVs by suppressing static clutter.

The synthesized N-CQDs exhibit an average diameter of approximately ~4.2 nm and emit bright blue fluorescence, with a maximum emission at 445 nm upon excitation at 360 nm. A “Turn-ON” response toward NFX was achieved with a detection limit of 0.30 nM, attributed to hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions that suppressed non-radiative decay. Moreover, the sensor demonstrates high selectivity for NFX, effectively distinguishing it from common interfering substances, including other antibiotics, organic acids, and biomolecules. The N-CQDs also exhibit excellent stability under diverse conditions, such as varying pH levels, high ionic strength, and prolonged irradiation. Finally, the practical applicability of the developed sensor was validated by detecting NFX in spiked broccoli extract and milk samples, with recovery rates ranging from 98.2% to 100.1% and relative standard deviations of less than 2.0%.

The novel PSO, with the avoiding local minima algorithm (PSO-ALM), uses a novel fitness function that can prevent the PSO search from trapping into the local minima and thus prevent the mobile robot from misidentifying the actual location. The fitness function penalizes nonsense solutions by introducing continuous integrity checks of solutions between two different consecutive locations. The proposed methodology enables accurate and real-time global localization of a mobile robot, given the underlying a priori map, with a consistent and predictable time complexity. Numerical simulations and real-world laboratory experiments with different a priori map accuracies have been conducted to prove the proper functioning of the method. The results have been compared with the benchmarks, i.e., the plain vanilla PSO and the built-in robot’s odometrical method, a genetic algorithm with included elitism and adaptive mutation rate (GA), the same GA algorithm with the included ALM algorithm (GA-ALM), the state-of-the-art plain vanilla golden eagle optimization (GEO) algorithm, and the same GEO algorithm with the added ALM algorithm (GEO-ALM). The results showed similar performance with the odometrical method right after recalibration and significantly better performance after some traveled distance. The GA and GEO algorithms with or without the ALM extension gave us similar results according to the accuracy of localization. The optimization algorithms’ performance with added ALM algorithms was much better at not getting caught in the local minimum, while the PSO-ALM algorithm gave us the overall best results.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6283","published_date":"2025-10-10T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T18:37:28.927012","language":"en","tags":["engineering","sensors","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Riko Šafarič","raw_content_length":1914,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PSO","Pepper","the PSO Algorithm","PSO-ALM"],"persons":["minima algorithm","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1894,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Mobile Robot Localization","the PSO Algorithm","the Fitness Function","the mobile robot","Localization","a semi-humanoid mobile robot Pepper","the particle swarm optimization","algorithm"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the PSO Algorithm","algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Mobile Robot Localization":2.0,"the PSO Algorithm":2.0,"the Fitness Function":2.0,"the mobile robot":2.0,"Localization":1.0,"a semi-humanoid mobile robot Pepper":1.0,"the particle swarm optimization":1.0,"algorithm":1.0}},"age_hours":18.727525176388887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8812,"joy":0.0352,"surprise":0.0261,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0136,"anger":0.0287,"disgust":0.0105},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel algorithm (PSO-ALM) for improving the localization accuracy of mobile robots, specifically Pepper.
