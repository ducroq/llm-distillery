While it derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through simulations, it remains at the research stage with no mention of real-world deployment or quantified environmental benefits. The vaporware flag is raised due to the lack of deployed units or operational data.",
