  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for coordinated beamforming in networked ISAC systems, focusing on improving localization performance. While it derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and proposes algorithms, it remains at the research stage with no actual deployments or quantified GHG emission reductions. The vaporware flag is raised because it's an early-stage concept without deployed units or operational data.",
