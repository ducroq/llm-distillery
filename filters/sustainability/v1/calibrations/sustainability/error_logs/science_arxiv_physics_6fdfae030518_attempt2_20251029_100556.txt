  "reasoning": "This article presents research on the photoionization response of gas in quasar outflows. While the research is scientifically sound and provides new constraints on the physical structure of quasar outflows, it is at a very early stage and has no direct, measurable impact on climate change mitigation or adaptation. The article quantifies the response timescales and gas density, providing specific metrics.",
