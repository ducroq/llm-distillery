  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel algorithm (DDEA) for combinatorial optimization, showing improvements in solving the Maximum Independent Set problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs compared to existing methods. The improvements are quantified by solution size (3.9% and 7.5% larger on specific datasets) and out-of-distribution performance (11.6% higher quality). However, it is still in the applied research stage with no clear path to deployment or economic viability, and the direct climate impact is theoretical.",
