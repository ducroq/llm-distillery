  "reasoning": "This article presents research on the photoionization response of gas in quasar outflows. While the research is scientifically sound and uses simulations and analytical estimates, it is at a very early stage and does not directly translate into concrete climate action or measurable outcomes in terms of emissions reduction or climate adaptation. The research provides constraints on gas density, with 40% of BAL gas having a density below $n_{\rm H} = 10^6\ \cc$, but this is not directly linked to a deployed technology or a measurable environmental impact.",
