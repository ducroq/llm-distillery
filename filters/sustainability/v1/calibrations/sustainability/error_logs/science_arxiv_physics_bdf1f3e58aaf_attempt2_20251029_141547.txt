  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion heating via Alfv\'en waves, quantifying the stochastic heating rate (Q) with a formula. While the research is scientifically sound, it is at a very early stage (basic research) with no deployment or economic viability demonstrated. The potential climate impact is indirect and speculative, as the application of this research to a specific climate technology is not described.",
