  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion stochastic heating by Alfv\'en waves. While the research is scientifically sound and provides a quantified heating rate (Q), it is still in the basic research phase with no immediate deployment or economic viability. The potential climate impact is indirect, as it could contribute to future fusion energy research, but this is highly speculative at this stage.",
