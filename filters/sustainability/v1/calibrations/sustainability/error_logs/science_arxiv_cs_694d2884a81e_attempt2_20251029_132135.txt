  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation, aiming to reduce computational complexity and utility loss compared to existing methods. The concrete action is the development and testing of this new framework. Evidence is provided through empirical results on benchmark datasets, showing improved performance (lower FID, higher downstream accuracy) compared to baselines. The stage of deployment is basic research, as it's primarily a theoretical framework tested on datasets.",
