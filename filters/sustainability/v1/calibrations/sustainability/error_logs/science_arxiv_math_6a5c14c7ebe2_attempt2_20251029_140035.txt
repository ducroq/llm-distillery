While it could potentially improve the efficiency of various computational tasks, including those related to climate modeling or energy optimization, it is currently at the basic research stage with no direct deployment or quantified impact on emissions. The paper provides theoretical complexity bounds, specifically ${\cal O(\epsilon^{-3/2})}$ and ${\cal O(\epsilon^{-2})}$ iteration counts, which are measurable outcomes.",
