  "reasoning": "The article presents a federated learning framework (\our) that reduces memory usage and accelerates training for resource-constrained clients. It demonstrates improved model performance (up to 84.2%), reduced peak memory usage (up to 50.4%), and accelerated training (up to 1.9x) in simulation and hardware testbeds. However, it is still in the applied research stage, lacking real-world deployment data and economic viability assessment.",
