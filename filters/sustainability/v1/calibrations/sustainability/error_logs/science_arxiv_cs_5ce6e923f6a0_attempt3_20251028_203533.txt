  "reasoning": "This paper proposes a novel sharpness measure (R\'enyi sharpness) for neural networks, aiming to improve generalization. The concrete action is the development of a new regularization method (RSAM) which shows a 2.5% test accuracy gain compared to existing methods. The evidence is based on extensive experiments and generalization bounds, but it's still in the research phase with no real-world deployment.",
