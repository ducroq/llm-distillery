It improves utility-privacy trade-offs and reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, as demonstrated by lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy on benchmarks. However, it's still in the applied research phase with no real-world deployment or economic viability demonstrated.",
