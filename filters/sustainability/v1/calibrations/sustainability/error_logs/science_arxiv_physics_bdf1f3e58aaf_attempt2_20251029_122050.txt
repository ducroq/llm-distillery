  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves. While the research is technically sound and provides a quantified heating rate (Q), it is still in the basic research phase with no clear path to deployment or economic viability. The potential climate impact is indirect and speculative at this stage, as it's unclear how this heating mechanism could be harnessed for sustainable applications.",
