  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation, aiming to improve utility-privacy trade-offs and reduce computational complexity. The framework is evaluated on benchmark datasets (OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp) and shows improved performance (lower FID, higher downstream accuracy) compared to baseline methods. However, it is still in the applied research stage with no evidence of real-world deployment or economic viability.",
