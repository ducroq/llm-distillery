  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation, aiming to improve utility-privacy trade-offs and reduce computational complexity. The concrete action is the development and empirical evaluation of this framework using benchmark datasets. The evidence supporting claims includes lower Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy compared to baselines, while requiring less noise. The innovation stage is applied research, as it is tested on benchmark datasets but not yet deployed in real-world applications.",
