  "reasoning": "This paper presents research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a phenomenon relevant to plasma environments. While the research provides a quantified heating rate (Q), it's currently at a theoretical stage with no deployed technology or direct link to GHG emission reduction. The research is peer-reviewed, lending credibility to the findings, but lacks economic viability or deployment readiness.",
