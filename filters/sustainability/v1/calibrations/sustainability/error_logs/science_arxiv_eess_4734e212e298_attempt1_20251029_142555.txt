  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework and algorithms for coordinated beamforming in networked ISAC systems, aiming to improve localization and communication. While the research derives a closed-form CRLB and proposes globally optimal algorithms under certain conditions, it remains at the simulation stage with no real-world deployment or quantified environmental impact. The vaporware flag is raised due to the lack of deployed units or operational data.",
