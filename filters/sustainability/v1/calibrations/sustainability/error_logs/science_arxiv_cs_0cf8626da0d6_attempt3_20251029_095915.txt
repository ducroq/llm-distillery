  "reasoning": "This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for deep Cox neural networks (Cox-NN). While improved efficiency in computation can indirectly contribute to sustainability by reducing energy consumption, the paper does not provide concrete actions or measurable outcomes related to climate change mitigation or adaptation. The research is at a basic research stage with theoretical analysis and simulation studies, but no deployment.",
