  "reasoning": "This paper presents a new statistical method (mb-MPLE) for optimizing deep neural networks used in survival analysis. While the research is theoretically sound and provides practical guidance, it is still in the early stages of development with no deployed applications or quantified environmental impact. The research focuses on improving the efficiency of algorithms, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by reducing computational resources needed for certain applications.",
