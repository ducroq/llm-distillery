  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework and algorithms for coordinated beamforming in networked ISAC systems. While it derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and proposes optimization algorithms, it remains at the research stage with no deployed technology or measured outcomes. The potential climate impact is indirect, relying on the future application of this technology in wireless systems that could improve energy efficiency.",
