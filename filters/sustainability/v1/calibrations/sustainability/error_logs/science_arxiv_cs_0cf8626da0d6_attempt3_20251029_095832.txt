  "reasoning": "This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimizing deep Cox neural networks. While improved optimization algorithms can indirectly contribute to sustainability by enabling faster development of climate models or more efficient resource allocation, the direct climate impact is minimal and theoretical at this stage. The technical credibility is relatively high due to the mathematical proofs and simulation studies, but deployment readiness is low as it's primarily theoretical research.",
