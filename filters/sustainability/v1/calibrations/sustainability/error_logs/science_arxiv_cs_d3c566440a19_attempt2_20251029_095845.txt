While it offers potential improvements in cryptographic algorithms, its direct impact on sustainability is minimal as it is in the early stages of research and does not involve any deployed technology or measurable environmental outcomes. The research is peer-reviewed and provides quantified metrics related to query complexity, increasing its technical credibility.",
