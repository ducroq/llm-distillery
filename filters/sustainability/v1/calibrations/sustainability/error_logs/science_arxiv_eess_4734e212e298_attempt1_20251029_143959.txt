  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework and algorithms for coordinated beamforming in networked ISAC systems. While it derives a closed-form CRLB and demonstrates effectiveness through simulations, it remains at the basic research stage with no deployed technology or real-world data. The potential climate impact is indirect, relying on future applications of improved wireless communication.",
