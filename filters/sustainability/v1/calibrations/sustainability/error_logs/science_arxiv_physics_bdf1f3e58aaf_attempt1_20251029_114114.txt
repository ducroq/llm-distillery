  "reasoning": "This paper presents theoretical research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a phenomenon relevant to plasma environments. While the research quantifies the stochastic heating rate (Q) with a formula, it remains at the basic research stage with no deployed technology or measured outcomes in a sustainability context. The potential climate impact is indirect and speculative, as the application to a specific climate technology is not defined.",
