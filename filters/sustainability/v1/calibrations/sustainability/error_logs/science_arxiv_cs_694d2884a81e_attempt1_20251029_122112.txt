  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation, aiming to improve utility-privacy trade-offs and reduce computational complexity. The concrete action is the development and empirical validation of SecPE on benchmark datasets, showing improvements in FID and downstream task accuracy compared to GDP-based baselines. The evidence is based on experimental results, but it's still in the applied research stage without real-world deployment.",
