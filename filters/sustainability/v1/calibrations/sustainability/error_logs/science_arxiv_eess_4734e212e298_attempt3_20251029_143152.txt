  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study on coordinated beamforming for networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the research derives a closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and proposes algorithms, it remains in the early stages of research without any deployed technology or measured outcomes. The potential climate impact is indirect, relying on the future application of this technology to improve wireless systems, which could potentially contribute to energy efficiency.",
