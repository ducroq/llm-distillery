  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework for differentially private synthetic text generation. The concrete action is the development of the SecPE framework and its empirical validation on benchmark datasets. The evidence supporting the claims is the lower FID and higher downstream task accuracy compared to baseline methods, as well as reduced computational complexity. The deployment stage is currently at the applied research level, with no real-world deployment mentioned.",
