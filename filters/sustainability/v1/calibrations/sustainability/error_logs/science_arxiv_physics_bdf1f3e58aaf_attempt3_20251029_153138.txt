  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical study of ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, providing a formula for the stochastic heating rate Q. While the research is scientifically sound and provides a quantifiable relationship, it remains at the basic research stage with no clear path to deployment or economic viability in the context of climate change mitigation. The impact is theoretical and not yet demonstrated in a real-world application.",
