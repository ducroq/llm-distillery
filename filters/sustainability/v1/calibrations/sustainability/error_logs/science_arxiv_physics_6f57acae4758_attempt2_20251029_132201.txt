  "reasoning": "This article presents a theoretical framework for highly sensitive sensors using the Goos-H\"anchen shift. While the described sensitivity improvement of $10^{13} {\mu}m/RIU$ is significant, it is currently a theoretical description confirmed numerically, not a deployed technology with measured real-world outcomes. Therefore, deployment readiness and economic viability are low.",
