  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework for differentially private synthetic text generation. While it shows improved performance on benchmarks like OpenReview and PubMed using Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and downstream task accuracy, it is still in the applied research stage with no real-world deployment or quantified environmental impact. The potential for reducing computational overhead is a positive, but the direct sustainability impact is currently theoretical.",
