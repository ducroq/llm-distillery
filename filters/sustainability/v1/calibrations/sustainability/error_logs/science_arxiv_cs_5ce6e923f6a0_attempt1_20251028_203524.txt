  "reasoning": "This paper proposes a novel sharpness measure (R\'enyi sharpness) for neural networks that correlates strongly with generalization. The concrete action is the development and experimental validation of this new measure and its application as a regularizer (RSAM) during training, achieving a test accuracy gain of nearly 2.5% compared to classical SAM. The evidence is based on extensive experiments and generalization bounds.",
