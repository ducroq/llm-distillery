  "reasoning": "This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation. While the research aims to reduce computational complexity and improve utility-privacy trade-offs, it is still in the applied research phase with no deployed units. The concrete action is the development and testing of the SecPE framework, and the evidence supporting claims comes from empirical results on benchmark datasets, showing lower FID and higher downstream task accuracy compared to baselines.",
