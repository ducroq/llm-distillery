  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical framework for improving the efficiency of the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption in large-scale computations used in climate modeling and other sustainability-related fields. The improvement is quantified by bounding the relative backward and forward errors, reaching levels of O(u) and O(u)\kappa(A)^{1/2}, respectively. It is currently in the basic research stage with numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results.",
