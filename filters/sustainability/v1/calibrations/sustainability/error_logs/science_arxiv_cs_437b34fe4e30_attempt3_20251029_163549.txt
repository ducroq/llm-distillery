  "reasoning": "This article presents theoretical research improving the efficiency of the simplex method for linear programming. While linear programming is used in many applications, including those related to sustainability, this research is at a very early stage and its direct impact on climate change is minimal. The technical credibility is high due to the mathematical nature of the work and its publication on arXiv.",
