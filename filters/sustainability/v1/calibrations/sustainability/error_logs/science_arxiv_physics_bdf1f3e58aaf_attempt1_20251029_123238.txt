  "reasoning": "This paper presents research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a fundamental process in plasma physics. While the research is scientifically sound and provides a quantified heating rate (Q), it is currently at a basic research stage with no clear path to direct climate impact or economic viability. The research could potentially be relevant to fusion energy, but that connection is not explicitly made, and fusion is not yet a deployed technology.",
