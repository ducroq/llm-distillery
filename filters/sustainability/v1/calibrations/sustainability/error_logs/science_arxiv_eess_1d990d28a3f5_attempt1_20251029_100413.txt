  "reasoning": "This article presents a theoretical analysis of a new sensing technology. While the research is peer-reviewed and demonstrates potential for improved sensing performance compared to conventional arrays, it is still in the early stages of development with no deployed units or economic viability demonstrated. The impact on climate is indirect, potentially improving resource allocation in applications that could reduce emissions, but this is not quantified.",
