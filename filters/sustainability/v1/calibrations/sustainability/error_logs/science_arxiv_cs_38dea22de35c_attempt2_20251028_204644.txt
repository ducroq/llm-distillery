  "reasoning": "This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its application to training large language models. While it validates predictions through simulations and LLM experiments (including Qwen2.5-7B), it remains at the research stage with no concrete deployment or measurable environmental impact yet. The paper derives a step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap.",
