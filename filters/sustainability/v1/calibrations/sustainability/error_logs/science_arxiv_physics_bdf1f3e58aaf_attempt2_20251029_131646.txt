  "reasoning": "This paper presents research on ion heating by Alfv\'en waves, a phenomenon found in space plasmas. While the research provides a formula for calculating the stochastic heating rate (Q), it is currently at a theoretical stage with no deployed technology or measurable impact on GHG emissions. The research is peer-reviewed, increasing its technical credibility, but lacks economic viability and deployment readiness.",
