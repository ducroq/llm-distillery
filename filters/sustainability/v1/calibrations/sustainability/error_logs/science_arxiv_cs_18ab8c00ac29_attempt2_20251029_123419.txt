  "reasoning": "This article presents a theoretical framework for improving the accuracy of the PCG algorithm, which can be used in various scientific and engineering applications, including climate modeling and energy system optimization. The concrete action is the development of a more accurate algorithm, supported by rigorous proofs and numerical experiments. However, it is still in the basic research stage, with no immediate deployment or quantifiable impact on emissions.",
