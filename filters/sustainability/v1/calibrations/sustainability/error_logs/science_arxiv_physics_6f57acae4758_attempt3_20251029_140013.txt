  "reasoning": "This article presents a theoretical formalism for giant Goos-H\"anchen shift, which could lead to highly sensitive sensors. While the theoretical description is confirmed numerically, it is still in the basic research stage with no deployed units or customer contracts. The potential climate impact is indirect, relying on the future application of these sensors in environmental monitoring or other sustainability-related fields.",
