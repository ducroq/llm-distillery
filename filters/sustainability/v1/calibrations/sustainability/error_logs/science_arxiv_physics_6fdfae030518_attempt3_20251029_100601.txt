  "reasoning": "This research explores the photoionization response of ionized gas, specifically focusing on quasar outflows. The concrete action is time-dependent photoionization simulations and analytical estimates to quantify response timescales. The evidence is supported by the use of simulations and analytical estimates, and the stage is basic research as it involves simulations and analysis rather than deployment.",
