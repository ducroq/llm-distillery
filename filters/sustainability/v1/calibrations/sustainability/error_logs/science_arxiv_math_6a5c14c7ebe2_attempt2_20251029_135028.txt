While the algorithm could potentially improve the efficiency of various applications, including those related to sustainability, it is currently in the basic research stage with no concrete deployments or measured outcomes related to GHG emissions or other environmental impacts. The paper provides theoretical complexity bounds, showing at most ${\cal O(\epsilon^{-3/2})}$ or ${\cal O(\epsilon^{-2})}$ iterations are needed to drive stationarity violation below $\\epsilon$.",
