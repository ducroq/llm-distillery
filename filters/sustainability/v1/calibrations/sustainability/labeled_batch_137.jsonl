Rather than computing residuals directly, it updates the residual vectors recursively. Current analyses of the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm in finite precision typically assume that the norm of the recursively updated residual goes orders of magnitude below the machine precision, focusing mainly on bounding the residual gap thereafter. This work introduces a framework for the PCG algorithm and provides rigorous proofs that the relative backward and forward errors of the computed results of PCG can reach the levels O(u) and O(u)\\kappa(A)^{1/2}, respectively, after a sufficient number of iterations without relying on an assumption concerning the norm of the recursively updated residual, where u represents the unit roundoff and \\kappa(A) is the condition number of A. Our PCG framework further shows that applying preconditioners in low precision does not compromise the accuracy of the final results, provided that reasonable conditions are satisfied. Our theoretical results are illustrated through a set of numerical experiments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11379","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.956513","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Thomas Bake, Erin Carson, Yuxin Ma","raw_content_length":1281,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PCG","linear"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1280,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Forward and backward error bounds","a mixed precision","preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm","arXiv251011379v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The preconditioned conjugate gradient PCG algorithm","the most popular algorithms","large-scale linear systems","Ax b","a symmetric positive definite matrix"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm","The preconditioned conjugate gradient PCG algorithm","the most popular algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Forward and backward error bounds":2.0,"a mixed precision":2.0,"preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm":2.0,"arXiv251011379v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The preconditioned conjugate gradient PCG algorithm":1.0,"the most popular algorithms":1.0,"large-scale linear systems":1.0,"Ax b":1.0,"a symmetric positive definite matrix":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758614921388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.0865,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8173,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.897,"joy":0.0059,"surprise":0.0218,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0255,"anger":0.0259,"disgust":0.019},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for improving the efficiency of solving large-scale linear systems, which are common in climate modeling and other scientific computations.

While these frequency bands offer abundant spectrum, they also pose severe propagation and hardware design challenges, motivating the search for alternative antenna solutions beyond conventional antenna arrays. Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) have emerged as a promising candidate for sub-THz systems due to their simple feed structure, low fabrication cost, and inherent angle-frequency coupling, which enables frequency-controlled beamsteering with simple hardware. In this article, we review the fundamentals of the LWA technology, highlight their unique properties, and showcase their potential in multi-user wideband sub-THz wireless communications. We present representative studies demonstrating that LWAs can simultaneously support high-rate multi-user communications and accurate localization using only a single antenna element. Finally, several key open challenges are outlined, spanning algorithm design, signal processing, information theory, standardization, and hardware implementation, that need to be addressed to fully harness LWAs as a cost-effective and scalable enabler of next generations of wireless systems.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11666","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.710181","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Natalie Lang, Atsutse K.

Most existing studies focus on monostatic and/or bistatic setups with limited coverage and capabilities. Networked ISAC systems with distributed base stations (BSs) can overcome these limitations. Moreover, movable antenna (MA) architectures offer improved ISAC performance over fixed-position antennas (FPAs) by enabling adaptable antenna movement. In this paper, we utilize the MA to promote communication capability with guaranteed sensing performance via jointly designing beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters and position configuration of transmit/receive MA towards maximizing the sum rate for both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users. The optimization problem is highly difficult due to the unique channel model derived from the position coefficient of the MA. To resolve this challenge, via leveraging the cutting-the-edge majorization-minimization (MM) method, we develop an efficient solution that optimizes all variables via convex optimization techniques. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the substantial performance promotion by deploying the MA framework in the networked ISAC system.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09426","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.735936","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Yang Liu, Qiong Wu, Kunlun Wang, Jun Li, Lexi Xu","raw_content_length":1315,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ISAC"],"persons":["antennas"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1314,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv241109426v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Integrated sensing","communication","ISAC","a key technology","future 6G networks","Most existing studies","monostatic andor bistatic setups","limited coverage"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv241109426v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Integrated sensing":1.0,"communication":1.0,"ISAC":1.0,"a key technology":1.0,"future 6G networks":1.0,"Most existing studies":1.0,"monostatic andor bistatic setups":1.0,"limited coverage":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7792098594444448,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8771,"joy":0.0224,"surprise":0.0799,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.0062,"disgust":0.0032},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach to integrated sensing and communication using movable antennas, potentially improving network efficiency.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms.

We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that jointly optimizes a dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC)-empowered base station (BS), considering its ISAC-based active beamforming, along with the passive STARS beamforming configurations of amplitudes, phase shifts, quantization levels, and element selection. Furthermore, relaxed/independent/coupled STARS are considered to examine architectural flexibility. To tackle the non-convex and mixed-integer problem, we propose a joint active-passive beamforming, quantization and element selection (AQUES) scheme based on the alternating optimization: Lagrangian dual and Dinkelbach's transformation tackle fractional equations, whereas successive convex approximation (SCA) convexifies the non-solvable problem; Penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework and penalty-based convex-concave programming (PCCP) procedure solve amplitude and phase-shifts with the equality constraint; Heuristic search iteratively decides the optimal quantization level; Integer relaxation deals with the discrete element selection variables. Simulation results demonstrate that STARS-ISAC with the proposed AQUES scheme significantly enhances EE while meeting communication rates and sensing quality requirements. The coupled STARS further highlights its superior EE performance over independent and relaxed STARS thanks to its reduced hardware complexity.

A key observation we make is that even slight input noise perturbations can cause unintended shifts in quantized codewords, thereby degrading the quality of reconstructed speech. Motivated by this finding, we propose a novel and resource-efficient training strategy to enhance the noise robustness of speech codecs by simulating such perturbations directly at the quantization level. Our approach introduces two core mechanisms: (1) a distance-weighted probabilistic top-K sampling strategy that replaces the conventional deterministic nearest-neighbor selection in residual vector quantization (RVQ); and (2) a progressive training scheme that introduces perturbations from the last to the first quantizer in a controlled manner. Crucially, our method is trained exclusively on clean speech, eliminating the need for any paired noisy-clean data. Experiments on two advanced neural speech codecs, Encodec and WavTokenizer, demonstrate that the proposed strategy substantially improves robustness under noisy conditions-for example, boosting UTMOS from 3.475 to 3.586 at 15 dB SNR on Encodec-while also enhancing coding quality for clean speech.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19025","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:49.743710","language":"en","tags":["systems","research","eessas","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Rui-Chen Zheng, Yang Ai, Hui-Peng Du, Li-Rong Dai","raw_content_length":1355,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Resource arXiv:2509.19025v2 Announce Type","RVQ"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1354,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Noise Robustness","Neural Speech Codecs","Resource","Announce Type","Abstract","Noise robustness","a critical challenge","neural speech codecs","real-world acoustic scenarios","background noise"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Noise Robustness":2.0,"Neural Speech Codecs":2.0,"Resource":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Noise robustness":1.0,"a critical challenge":1.0,"neural speech codecs":1.0,"real-world acoustic scenarios":1.0,"background noise":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7794999466666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.36,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8744,"joy":0.01,"surprise":0.0169,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0331,"anger":0.0339,"disgust":0.0236},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the noise robustness of neural speech codecs, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption by improving the efficiency of voice-activated devices and communication systems.

However, the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of KIDINS220-related disorders remains incompletely understood. Herein, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features of a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif (SAM) -like domain mutation identified in a Chinese family with HSP accompanied by severe peripheral neuropathy (PN).MethodsClinical data, electrophysiological characteristics, and sural nerve histopathology were analyzed in a 19-year-old Chinese male. Genetic testing was performed in his family by using whole-exome sequencing, mitochondrial genome testing, and Sanger validation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze the phenotypic and genetic data of previously reported cases with KIDINS220 variants up to July 2025.ResultsThe proband exhibited classical signs of autosomal dominant HSP accompanied by severe multifocal sensory-motor PN. The spinal cord MRI showed mild spinal cord thinning, while the brain MRI and nerve ultrasound examinations were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed absent sensory nerve responses and globally reduced motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed significantly reduced nerve fiber density, myelin defects, axonal degeneration, and mitochondrial abnormalities. A heterozygous KIDINS220 c.3668A > G (p. Glu1223Gly) mutation, located within the SAM domain, was identified in both the proband and his mother. A total of 42 cases from 11 cohorts were reviewed.ConclusionWe suggest that patients with KIDINS220 SAM domain mutation may present with HSP accompanied by severe, mixed axonal and demyelinating PN, expanding the existing spectrum of the clinical phenotypes and pathogenic variants of KIDINS220.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1684980","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:55.368754","language":"en","tags":["original_research","neuroscience","open-access","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Rui Wu","raw_content_length":1840,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ObjectivesMutations","HSP"],"persons":["Herein","Sanger"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1840,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hereditary spastic paraplegia","A novel KIDINS220 mutation","severe peripheral neuropathy","HSP","ObjectivesMutations","KIDINS220","SINO syndrome","the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum","KIDINS220-related disorders","a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hereditary spastic paraplegia":3.0,"A novel KIDINS220 mutation":2.0,"severe peripheral neuropathy":2.0,"HSP":2.0,"ObjectivesMutations":1.0,"KIDINS220":1.0,"SINO syndrome":1.0,"the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum":1.0,"KIDINS220-related disorders":1.0,"a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780398990555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4712,"joy":0.0038,"surprise":0.0155,"sadness":0.0589,"fear":0.2727,"anger":0.0464,"disgust":0.1315},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on identifying a novel genetic mutation associated with a specific disease.

{"id":"science_frontiers_neuroscience_b1b16123d28d","title":"Prognostic value of quantitative and visual electroencephalography in disorders of consciousness: a retrospective study","content":"BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess prognosis in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Visual assessments by physicians and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are commonly used; however, only a few studies have directly compared their predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the prognostic value of visual EEG classification versus that of qEEG-based spectral analysis for survival and neurological outcomes in patients with impaired consciousness.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we examined 97 patients with impaired consciousness admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital between April 2018 and December 2023. Visual EEG grading was performed using a conventional grading system based on established criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed incorporating qEEG and clinical prognostic factors (Scarpino score, rehabilitation status, and age). The incremental predictive value of clinical variables was assessed using DeLong’s test.ResultsVisual EEG assessment showed moderate predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77 for survival; 0.677–0.725 for neurological outcomes]. qEEG-based models showed comparable performance to visual EEG classification, with slightly higher AUC values that were not statistically significant. The addition of clinical factors significantly improved predictive accuracy, particularly for neurological recovery (AUC improved from 0.729 to 0.936; P < 0.001).ConclusionCombining qEEG features and clinical prognostic factors provided a comprehensive approach for outcome prediction in patients with DoC. These findings support the potential of a multimodal prognostic framework integrating objective EEG metrics and physician-derived evaluations, although further prospective validation is required.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1644497","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:55.369188","language":"en","tags":["original_research","neuroscience","open-access","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Itaru Miura","raw_content_length":1963,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BackgroundElectroencephalography","EEG","DoC","the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital"],"persons":[],"locations":["ROC"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1963,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["disorders","consciousness","Prognostic value","quantitative and visual electroencephalography","a retrospective study","patients","BackgroundElectroencephalography","EEG","prognosis","DoC"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["a retrospective study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"disorders":3.0,"consciousness":3.0,"Prognostic value":2.0,"quantitative and visual electroencephalography":2.0,"a retrospective study":2.0,"patients":2.0,"BackgroundElectroencephalography":1.0,"EEG":1.0,"prognosis":1.0,"DoC":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780413806666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3667,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0131,"sadness":0.0249,"fear":0.5191,"anger":0.0221,"disgust":0.0453},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study compares visual EEG assessment with qEEG-based spectral analysis for predicting outcomes in patients with disorders of consciousness.

{"id":"science_frontiers_neuroscience_551edc760dc8","title":"Inflammation","content":"ObjectivePost-stroke depression (PSD), a common neuropsychiatric complication, significantly hinders stroke recovery and quality of life. Given the established role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PSD, this study aimed to identify key inflammation-related genes and pathways using bioinformatics and machine learning and further evaluate the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer compounds.MethodsPSD-related datasets (GSE16561, GSE98793) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, followed by functional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Three machine learning algorithms—random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)—were applied to screen inflammation-related hub genes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Candidate TCM compounds were explored via the Coremine Medical database. A PSD rat model was established to validate hub gene expression and to assess the efficacy of berberine (BBR).ResultsAnalysis identified 35 inflammation-related DEGs (IDEGs) significantly enriched in immunological processes, including malaria pathogenesis, NETosis, innate immune deficiencies, Rap1 signaling, and IL-17 cascades. The integration of machine learning pinpointed TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core hub genes, demonstrating robust diagnostic performance in external validation. Molecular docking suggested a strong binding affinity between the TCM compound BBR and TLR2/CYP1B1 proteins. PSD rats exhibited prolonged immobility in forced swim/tail suspension tests and decreased sucrose preference versus controls, alongside neuronal damage, edema, and inflammatory infiltration (HE staining). BBR treatment reversed these behavioral deficits and pathological changes. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression in PSD rats, significantly downregulated by BBR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed increased serum IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in PSD, which BBR effectively reduced.ConclusionThis study identifies TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core inflammation-related genes in PSD. BBR demonstrates therapeutic efficacy as an active monomer compound against PSD, likely mediated through downregulating TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression, consequently diminishing the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) that mediate cerebroprotective actions.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1684297","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:55.369651","language":"en","tags":["original_research","neuroscience","open-access","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":327,"author":"Yulai Li","raw_content_length":2616,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.635,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TCM","PSD","GEO","the Gene Expression Omnibus"],"persons":["Gene Ontology","GSE16561","Kyoto Encyclopedia"],"locations":["analy"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2616,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Inflammation","PSD","ObjectivePost-stroke depression","a common neuropsychiatric complication","stroke recovery","quality","life","the established role","inflammation","the pathogenesis"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Inflammation":2.0,"PSD":2.0,"ObjectivePost-stroke depression":1.0,"a common neuropsychiatric complication":1.0,"stroke recovery":1.0,"quality":1.0,"life":1.0,"the established role":1.0,"inflammation":1.0,"the pathogenesis":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7804286736111115,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6382,"joy":0.013,"surprise":0.0159,"sadness":0.1694,"fear":0.0743,"anger":0.0284,"disgust":0.0608},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies TLR2 and CYP1B1 as potential therapeutic targets for post-stroke depression and demonstrates the efficacy of berberine (BBR) in a rat model.

This study examines their status and relationships among Chinese medical students.MethodsAn online questionnaire survey based on the web-based survey platform “Questionnaire Star” was performed with medical college students in Jilin Province, China. The questionnaire content comprised the status of the participants' parental rearing style, social avoidance and distress, and social adaptability by employing specific survey scales, and mediation effect analysis was conducted to examine the mediating role of social psychology process in the relationship between parental rearing styles and social adaptability.ResultsTwo thousand hundred and sixty-six medical college students were subjected to statistical analysis. Parental rearing styles and social avoidance and distress show differences among sociodemographic factors of gender, household registration, whether is one-child, and parental education (p < 0.05). Students from urban households, with one-child identities and those whose parents had high educational levels obtained high social adaptability scores (p < 0.05). The multivariate analysis results are as follows: social distress (β = −0.399, p < 0.001), social avoidance (β = −0.304, p < 0.001), mother's rearing style of “emotional warmth and understanding” (β = 0.135, p < 0.001), and father's rearing style of “overprotection” (β = −0.087, p < 0.001) are the independent factors influencing medical college students' social adaptability. Mediation effect analysis further reveal that parental rearing styles of “emotional warmth and understanding” and “overprotective” can directly or indirectly affect students' social avoidance and distress to influence their social adaptability.ConclusionReducing students' social avoidance and distress, strengthening “emotional warmth and understanding,” and preventing “overprotective” parental rearing styles are effective ways to improve medical college students' social adaptability.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1617863","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.113804","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":289,"author":"Bing Shao","raw_content_length":2178,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.445,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BackgroundAlthough"],"persons":[],"locations":["China","Jilin Province"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2178,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["China","social psychology process","medical students","Jilin Province","Status","influence","parental rearing style","social adaptability","college students","an example"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"China":4.0,"social psychology process":3.0,"medical students":3.0,"Jilin Province":3.0,"Status":2.0,"influence":2.0,"parental rearing style":2.0,"social adaptability":2.0,"college students":2.0,"an example":2.0}},"age_hours":6.780460101388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8906,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0361,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.0124,"anger":0.0208,"disgust":0.0185},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study explores the relationship between parental rearing styles and social adaptability of medical students.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_b7136aba1a1f","title":"Reperceiving depression: how trait mindfulness enhances perceived support through improved doctor–patient relationships and stigma alleviation in depressed young adults","content":"ObjectiveDepression, a prevalent mental health disorder among global youth, adversely impacts educational attainment, social functioning, and psychological wellbeing. Given the established protective function of perceived social support against depressive symptoms, this study investigates how trait mindfulness enhances such support through three mediating factors: therapeutic alliance perceptions, ruminative responses, and stigma internalization in clinically diagnosed adolescents.MethodsGuided by the Reperceiving Model of Mindfulness, this study examines the pathways connecting trait mindfulness, rumination, stigma, doctor–patient relationship perceptions, and perceived social support in adolescents with depression. Utilizing online convenience sampling, 569 participants (aged 14–30) meeting clinical depression criteria were recruited. Analytical procedures involved: Assessing measurement reliability and demographic variations using SPSS 26.0. Implementing structural equation modeling with Amos 26.0 to evaluate model fit, examine latent variable associations, and estimate standardized path coefficients.ResultsThe analysis demonstrated that trait mindfulness significantly enhanced perceived social support (β = 0.331, p < 0.001), with perceptions of the doctor–patient relationship partially mediating this relationship (indirect effect = 0.023, 95% CI [0.001–0.057]). Trait mindfulness also markedly reduced stigma (β = −0.375, p < 0.001), which subsequently diminished perceived social support (β = −0.177, p < 0.01). Stigma further mediated the mindfulness-social support linkage (indirect effect = 0.051, 95% CI [0.018–0.097]). In contrast, rumination showed no significant direct effect (β = −0.083, p =0.206) nor mediation capacity between trait mindfulness and social support (indirect effect = 0.040, 95% CI [−0.027 to 0.110]).ConclusionThis investigation establishes that trait mindfulness effectively augments perceived social support in depressed adolescents through dual pathways: enhancing doctor–patient relationship perceptions and mitigating stigma. Notably, rumination demonstrates no significant impact on social support acquisition in this clinical population. By delineating these mechanistic pathways, our findings highlight mindfulness-based interventions' therapeutic potential, proposing targeted training protocols to amplify social support networks for improved mental health outcomes in youth depression management.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1589931","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.115026","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":297,"author":"Chao Liu","raw_content_length":2461,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.485,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ObjectiveDepression"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2461,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["trait mindfulness","Reperceiving depression","perceived support","improved doctor","patient relationships","stigma alleviation","depressed young adults","ObjectiveDepression","a prevalent mental health disorder","global youth"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["trait mindfulness"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"trait mindfulness":3.0,"Reperceiving depression":2.0,"perceived support":2.0,"improved doctor":2.0,"patient relationships":2.0,"stigma alleviation":2.0,"depressed young adults":2.0,"ObjectiveDepression":1.0,"a prevalent mental health disorder":1.0,"global youth":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780502315555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4168,"joy":0.0521,"surprise":0.0047,"sadness":0.1313,"fear":0.255,"anger":0.0249,"disgust":0.1152},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the impact of trait mindfulness on perceived social support in adolescents with depression.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_3e6333171df9","title":"The relationship between adolescent legal cognition and academic burnout: the moderating role of satisfaction with the natural environment","content":"BackgroundAcademic burnout is common among adolescents and is linked to adverse academic and behavioral outcomes. Although poor academic performance is a known risk factor for juvenile delinquency and legal cognition has been identified as a protective factor against delinquent behavior, the relationship between legal cognition and academic burnout has not been examined.MethodsIn June 2024, 518 in-school students (secondary and university) in Zhejiang Province, China completed measures of legal cognition, academic burnout, and natural-environment satisfaction. Data were analyzed in SPSS: Pearson correlations, hierarchical regression controlling for gender, age, and parental education, and simple-slope tests with 5,000 bootstrap resamples to probe significant interactions.ResultsLegal cognition correlated negatively with academic burnout (r = −0.16, p < 0.001) and positively with natural-environment satisfaction (r = 0.34, p < 0.001); burnout correlated negatively with natural-environment satisfaction (r = −0.12, p = 0.010). In regression models, legal cognition negatively predicted burnout (β = −0.19, p < 0.001). Importantly, the interaction between legal cognition and natural-environment satisfaction was significant (β = −0.08, p = 0.038), and simple-slope tests showed that the inverse association between legal cognition and burnout was stronger at higher levels of natural-environment satisfaction.ConclusionLegal cognition is inversely associated with adolescent academic burnout, and this protective effect is amplified when students report greater satisfaction with their natural environment.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_4f52da821a88","title":"Increasing affective distance","content":"IntroductionEmotional processing is linked with spatial attention, which prioritizes emotional stimuli over neutral ones. The interconnection between spatial and emotional processing may rely on the overlap between the networks underpinning such cognitive functions. Recent evidence has indeed identified a link between the rightward visuospatial bias exhibited by healthy individuals and the challenge in understanding emotional states, so-called alexithymia. However, while spatial attention has been manipulated by prism adaptation (PA), a well-known sensorimotor training, whether this is possible with emotional processing has never been investigated.MethodsNinety-five participants completed alexithymia questionnaires, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ), before and after a single session of either leftward or rightward deviating PA.ResultsWhile both males and females showed the expected sensorimotor aftereffect solely leftward PA modulated alexithymia scores, and it did so only for women. The results indicate that leftward PA not only affects visuospatial performance, but also emotional processing, particularly in how individuals perceive and interpret emotional proximity and distance.DiscussionAlexithymia may be, therefore, metaphorically linked to impaired perception of emotional closeness and remoteness. These findings suggest that PA may modulate emotional capacities in a sex-dependent manner, offering insights into its therapeutic potential while also highlighting the need for caution as prolonged PA-based interventions may affect emotional well-being.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1666287","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.116509","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Selene Schintu","raw_content_length":1622,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PAQ","IntroductionEmotional","Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire"],"persons":[],"locations":["Toronto"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1622,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Increasing affective distance","spatial attention","IntroductionEmotional processing","which","emotional stimuli","neutral ones","The interconnection","spatial and emotional processing","the overlap","the networks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Increasing affective distance":2.0,"spatial attention":2.0,"IntroductionEmotional processing":1.0,"which":1.0,"emotional stimuli":1.0,"neutral ones":1.0,"The interconnection":1.0,"spatial and emotional processing":1.0,"the overlap":1.0,"the networks":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780559077222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8687,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0216,"sadness":0.0182,"fear":0.0232,"anger":0.0141,"disgust":0.0487},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on the impact of prism adaptation on emotional processing, specifically alexithymia.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_5504330a952d","title":"Tracking down the Candy Crush Terrorist: the fragile relation between gaming motives and radical attitudes","content":"The gaming ecosystem is increasingly observed with the concern that it could pose a threat to public safety, and research accumulates evidence for blatant extremism in the surrounding online space of games. Currently, a connection between gaming and extremism can be established through identity related processes, e.g., gaming-related radicalization elements, distal to gaming itself, such as gaming communities and culture. However, this also raises the question of what the precise function of proximal gaming factors, such as gameplay, mechanics, stories, or game-play motivations, is in the relationship between gaming and extremism. This article aims to shed light on the relation of gaming and extremism by identifying individual profiles of videogame playing based on gameplay motivations and linking them to indications of radical attitudes (here: xenophobia and violence acceptance) as well as conspiracy beliefs that can be associated with extremist beliefs. Further, we include marginalization and anomie as mediators to gain comparative and fine-grained information about the sole impact of gaming motives on radical attitudes. Our findings indicate that while few motivational profiles exhibit weak yet direct connections to radical attitudes, others display the opposite pattern, suggesting a more complex relationship. Marginalization and anomie strongly predict most radical outcome variables and mediate the relationship in most cases, however sometimes negatively. We only found one complex motivational profile that substantially leans toward late-stage radical attitudes, while for instance, dominant social motives clearly inhibit radical outcomes. The current study thus deflates any straightforward perspective on the becoming of a ‘radical gamer'.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1585576","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.116890","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Diana Rieger","raw_content_length":1772,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Candy Crush Terrorist"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1772,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Candy Crush Terrorist","gaming motives","radical attitudes","The gaming ecosystem","the concern","a threat","public safety","research","evidence","blatant extremism"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["research"],"research_academic":["research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Candy Crush Terrorist":2.0,"gaming motives":2.0,"radical attitudes":2.0,"The gaming ecosystem":1.0,"the concern":1.0,"a threat":1.0,"public safety":1.0,"research":1.0,"evidence":1.0,"blatant extremism":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780574243055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0775000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7845,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0769,"joy":0.0028,"surprise":0.0066,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.8327,"anger":0.0503,"disgust":0.0249},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the relationship between gaming motivations and radical attitudes.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted across 16 UAE public university campuses from November 2022 to February 2023, yielding 7,244 complete responses from students aged 18 and above. The survey assessed anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and included items on demographics, physical and mental health, support systems, and behavior patterns such as substance use and internet engagement. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations between anxiety and key explanatory variables. Results revealed that 8% of respondents experienced severe anxiety, with significant associations observed between anxiety and gender, age, income, disability status, and physical health conditions. Females, younger individuals, those with household incomes below AED 10,000, and students with chronic illnesses or disabilities were at higher risk. Mental health comorbidities such as depression, panic attacks, eating disorders, OCD, and ADHD showed strong associations with anxiety severity. Furthermore, behavioral correlations including excessive internet use, gaming, alcohol consumption, and prescribed medication use were linked to elevated anxiety levels, although not all were statistically significant. Despite efforts to increase mental health awareness in the UAE, stigma and cultural norms remain barriers to help-seeking. The study underscores the need for culturally tailored mental health interventions that address stigma, promote early screening, and consider the role of maladaptive coping behaviors. Universities should implement accessible support systems that incorporate Arabic-language resources, peer mentoring, and family or religious engagement. These findings contribute to the global understanding of anxiety in higher education and highlight the importance of localized mental health strategies in post-pandemic recovery.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1666403","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.117265","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":278,"author":"Joelle Chamoun","raw_content_length":2130,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.39,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UAE","Emirati","the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item"],"persons":["GAD-7"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2130,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cultural stressors","behavioral correlations","post","anxiety","This study","the prevalence","predictors","Emirati university students","the post-pandemic period","the influence"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study","Emirati university students"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cultural stressors":2.0,"behavioral correlations":2.0,"post":2.0,"anxiety":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the prevalence":1.0,"predictors":1.0,"Emirati university students":1.0,"the post-pandemic period":1.0,"the influence":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780591701111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0705,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5859,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0866,"joy":0.0096,"surprise":0.0101,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.8722,"anger":0.0071,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies correlations between anxiety and various socio-demographic and behavioral factors among Emirati university students.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_356137004124","title":"Open group dialogue on post","content":"IntroductionA high discrepancy between a generally positive attitude and consent to donation has been observed in Italy, as in 2021 only 68.2% of registered individuals had provided consent. Understanding which variables may play a role in this decision-making process, considering the experiences of different groups, is essential to support the development and implementation of targeted policies. The aim of this study was to investigate the demographic and psychosocial variables associated with the decision to register consent for post-mortem organ donation in Italy, and to compare the experiences of different population groups to support the development of targeted policies.MethodsA quantitative study was conducted in 2021 in collaboration with the National Centre for Transplantation. A total of 353 participants–including healthcare professionals, citizens, opinion leaders and registry office employees–completed an ad-hoc questionnaire before and after participating in a focus group on organ donation. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were conducted.ResultsOf the 353 participants, 93.8% reported a positive attitude toward post-mortem organ donation (score > 5 on a 7-point Likert scale). In the pre-focus group questionnaire, the mean attitude was 6.45 (SD = 1.05), which increased significantly to 6.56 (SD = 0.99) after the focus groups (Z = −4.06, p < 0.001). Regarding actual behavior, 50.4% had already registered their consent to donation. Significant associations emerged between positive attitude and gender (women reporting higher scores; U = 13,129, p = 0.045), level of education (r = 0.156, p = 0.004), familiarity with donation (e.g., knowing a donor or someone who registered consent; p < 0.001), and being registered with donation-related associations (p < 0.001). Intention to register was strongly predicted by attitude (p < 0.001), and actual consent registration was more likely among participants with higher education and those familiar with donation practices.ConclusionFindings highlight the role of demographic factors, familiarity, and personal values in shaping donation behavior, supporting the use of multivariable models to better explain consent registration. These insights underline the need to implement targeted awareness campaigns and policies aimed at promoting informed choices about organ donation.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1631504","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.118078","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":334,"author":"Sabrina Cipolletta","raw_content_length":2368,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.67,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the National Centre for Transplantation"],"persons":[],"locations":["Italy"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2368,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Open group dialogue","post","consent","IntroductionA high discrepancy","a generally positive attitude","donation","Italy","only 682","registered individuals","which variables"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Open group dialogue":2.0,"post":2.0,"consent":2.0,"IntroductionA high discrepancy":1.0,"a generally positive attitude":1.0,"donation":1.0,"Italy":1.0,"only 682":1.0,"registered individuals":1.0,"which variables":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7806220163888895,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.4425,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8885,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8969,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0195,"sadness":0.01,"fear":0.0171,"anger":0.0192,"disgust":0.0326},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a study on attitudes toward organ donation, but it lacks concrete actions or measurable outcomes related to environmental sustainability.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_bb622621babf","title":"Psychological detachment in Chinese higher education: a multitheoretical model of academic stress, cultural pressure, and coping resources","content":"Psychological detachment—the ability to mentally disengage from academic demands during non-study time—remains elusive for Chinese university students, intensified by cultural norms that equate disengagement with weakness and by institutional systems reinforcing constant connectivity. This study integrates the Stressor–Strain–Outcome Model, Conservation of Resources Theory, and Cognitive Appraisal Theory to examine how academic perfectionism, social comparison anxiety, digital burnout, and filial piety stress affect detachment. The mediating roles of resilience, self-esteem, and perceived social support, and the moderating effect of help-seeking stigma, were also tested. A time-lagged survey of 383 students in Zhejiang, analyzed with PLS-SEM, revealed that social comparison anxiety strongly undermines detachment, while digital burnout exerts weaker direct effects but interacts with coping resources. Resilience and self-esteem consistently mediated stressor–detachment links, though stigma diminished their protective effects. These results extend stress-coping theory by showing how cultural obligations and digital immersion constrain recovery in collectivist contexts. The findings highlight the need for resilience training, stigma-reduction initiatives, and digital wellbeing programs. Beyond China, the study underscores how universal stressors such as perfectionism and comparison interact with cultural scripts, offering insights transferable to global higher education.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1647184","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:56.118431","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Meng Na","raw_content_length":1491,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PLS"],"persons":["Stressor"],"locations":["Zhejiang"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1491,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Psychological detachment","Chinese higher education","a multitheoretical model","academic stress","cultural pressure","resources","the ability","academic demands","non-study time","Chinese university students"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["academic stress","academic demands","non-study time","Chinese university students"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Psychological detachment":3.0,"Chinese higher education":2.0,"a multitheoretical model":2.0,"academic stress":2.0,"cultural pressure":2.0,"resources":2.0,"the ability":1.0,"academic demands":1.0,"non-study time":1.0,"Chinese university students":1.0}},"age_hours":6.780637108611112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.6475,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6705,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6177,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0234,"sadness":0.0474,"fear":0.2517,"anger":0.0237,"disgust":0.0315},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies stressors impacting psychological detachment in Chinese university students and examines the mediating roles of resilience and self-esteem.

The parameter-adaptive CPO optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the key parameters of VMD (decomposition level k, quadratic penalty factor α), effectively solving the challenge of determining the optimal parameter combination in the VMD algorithm. Based on the probability density function (PDF), the Wasserstein distance is used as a similarity metric to screen intrinsic mode functions. Subsequently, the IWT is applied to obtain the optimal wavelet threshold, which compensates for the shortcomings of traditional threshold methods while further suppressing both low-frequency and high-frequency noise in the signal, ultimately yielding the denoising result. Experimental results demonstrate that for both simulated signals and actual LiDAR echo signals, the VMD-CPO-IWT method outperforms Neighcoeff-db4 wavelet denoising (WT-db4), EMD combined with detrended fluctuation analysis denoising (EMD-DFA), and VMD combined with Whale Optimization Algorithm (VMD-WOA) in terms of improving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For the actual LiDAR echo signal at a detection range of 25 m, the SNR is improved by 13.64 dB, and the RMSE is reduced by 62.6%.

In regions where tourism represents a primary economic driver and a major source of local development funding, such reliance has increasingly been recognized as a source of vulnerability. By analyzing survey data collected across islands that differ in geographic size and local characteristics, the research offers an in-depth understanding of how local communities perceive the impacts and future of tourism. Data were analyzed using explanatory factor analysis and cluster analysis. The findings reveal three distinct groups of residents, based on their perceptions of tourism development and shaped by three underlying attitudinal dimensions. The first group strongly supports tourism development. While moderately supportive of tourism as a development strategy, the second group raises concerns about its excessive pressure on local communities and advocates for more stringent regulation. The third group emphasizes the risks associated with tourism-driven growth. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of local perspectives, reflecting varying levels of perceived resilience and vulnerability. The results suggest that areas where residents express greater confidence in tourism and its benefits may exhibit stronger resilience to external shocks and be better suited for tourism-focused development. Conversely, areas where skepticism or concern about tourism prevail may be more susceptible to disruptions and would benefit from more diversified development strategies to build long-term resilience.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9078","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:58.885874","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","open-access","environment","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Zeljka Kordej-De Villa","raw_content_length":1675,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.14,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Sustainability of Tourism Development on Croatian Islands"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1665,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Vulnerability","Tourism Development","Croatian Islands","tourism","This research","residents attitudes","Croatian islands","a lens"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"engineering":["Tourism Development"],"research_academic":["This research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":4.0,"Pages":2.0,"Vulnerability":2.0,"Tourism Development":2.0,"Croatian Islands":2.0,"tourism":2.0,"This research":1.0,"residents attitudes":1.0,"Croatian islands":1.0,"a lens":1.0}},"age_hours":6.781171489722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6872,"joy":0.0135,"surprise":0.0184,"sadness":0.0177,"fear":0.1859,"anger":0.0294,"disgust":0.048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes survey data to understand residents' attitudes toward tourism and its impact on the sustainability of tourism-led development on Croatian islands.

Yet most twisting mechanisms rely on bulky attachment interfaces and relatively high actuation pressures, limiting practicality in assistive applications. This study introduces the first Twisting Soft Sleeve Actuator (TSSA), a self-contained, wearable actuator that produces controlled bidirectional torsion. The design integrates helically folded bellows with internal stabilization layers to suppress radial expansion and enhance torque transmission. The TSSA is fabricated from thermoplastic polyurethane using a Bowden-type fused filament fabrication (FFF) process optimized for airtightness and flexibility. Performance was characterized using a modular test platform that measured angular displacement and output force under positive pressure (up to 75 kPa) and vacuum (down to −85 kPa). A parametric study evaluated the effects of fold width, fold angle, wall thickness, and twist angle. Results demonstrate bidirectional, self-restoring torsion with clockwise rotation of approximately 30 degrees and a peak output force of about 40 N at 75 kPa, while reverse torsional motion occurred under vacuum actuation.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_e970e0e11c5d","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 4019: Diffusion","content":"Audio steganography exploits redundancies in the human auditory system to conceal secret information within cover audio, ensuring that the hidden data remains undetectable during normal listening. However, recent research shows that current audio steganography techniques are vulnerable to detection by deep learning-based steganalyzers, which analyze the high-dimensional features of stego audio for classification. While deep learning-based steganography has been extensively studied for image covers, its application to audio remains underexplored, particularly in achieving robust embedding and extraction with minimal perceptual distortion. We propose a diffusion-based audio steganography model comprising two primary modules: (i) a diffusion-based embedding module that autonomously integrates secret messages into cover audio while preserving high perceptual quality and (ii) a corresponding diffusion-based extraction module that accurately recovers the embedded data.

After training, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of embedding capacity and resistance to detection by deep learning steganalyzers.

While giant primes rarely aid cryptography, they find use in areas such as locally decodable codes. Large prime-hunting, often brute-force in nature, is conceptually linked to the Riemann Hypothesis and the prime number theorem, which portrays prime distribution as essentially random. This motivates a statistical perspective, with Bayesian methodology providing a natural foundation. We show that the prime number theorem suggests a nonhomogeneous Poisson process for prime counts, yielding primes as waiting times. This process agrees with the prime number theorem, asymptotic results, and prime gap properties. Building on it, we develop a recursive Bayesian theory for large prime prediction and Riemann Hypothesis validation. The approach matches traditional but computationally infeasible non-recursive Bayesian formulations in the limit, and it strongly falsifies the Riemann Hypothesis. Finally, we propose a computational method using Transformation-based MCMC to simulate recursive posterior predictives. A simple change of variable enables simulation of Mersenne prime exponents. With modest computing resources, we identified 259 primes over 140 million, including 184 strong Mersenne candidates corresponding to potential primes with 42--242 million digits.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09651","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.190726","language":"en","tags":["mathgm","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Durba Bhattacharya, Sucharita Roy, Sourabh Bhattacharya","raw_content_length":1466,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bayes Meets Riemann","the Riemann Hypothesis","Riemann Hypothesis"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1461,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bayes","Riemann","Large Prime Discovery","arXiv251009651v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Prime numbers","fascinated mathematicians","antiquity","ongoing efforts","both their properties"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Large Prime Discovery"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bayes":2.0,"Riemann":2.0,"Large Prime Discovery":2.0,"arXiv251009651v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Prime numbers":1.0,"fascinated mathematicians":1.0,"antiquity":1.0,"ongoing efforts":1.0,"both their properties":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7828329294444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6983,"joy":0.0898,"surprise":0.1818,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0113,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0023},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel computational method for identifying large prime numbers.

We consider generalizations of this setting to bases that are representable, but not necessarily countable. We introduce the notions of a computable presubbase and a computable prebase. We prove a generalization of the Theorem of Kreitz-Weihrauch for the presubbase representation that shows that any such representation is admissible with respect to the topology generated by compact intersections of the presubbase elements. For computable prebases we obtain representations that are admissible with respect to the topology that they generate. These concepts provide a natural way to investigate many topological spaces that have been studied in computable analysis. The benefit of this approach is that topologies can be described by their usual subbases and standard constructions for such subbases can be applied.

We first establish the well-posedness of the local problem and the global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions in $C^1$ space. We then study the associated nonlocal eigenvalue problem, proving the existence, simplicity, qualitative properties, and asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue. The analysis employs Fredholm theory, the Crandall--Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, and Hadamard-type derivative formulas to describe its parameter dependence and connection with the basic reproduction number~$R_0$. Building on this spectral characterization, we show that the system admits a \\emph{sharp vanishing--spreading dichotomy} in its long-term dynamics. When $R_0\\le1$, all solutions vanish; for $R_0>1$, the outcome depends on the initial domain size~$h_0$ and the free-boundary expansion rate~$\\mu$.

In the spreading regime, solutions converge to the unique positive steady state, while in the vanishing regime they decay uniformly to zero.

However, solving large-scale instances remains computationally challenging due to the high cost of solving linear systems and performing eigenvalue decompositions. In this paper, we present a quantum alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) for SDPs, building on recent advances in quantum computing. An inexact ADMM framework is developed, which tolerates errors in the iterates arising from block-encoding approximation and quantum measurement. Within this robust scheme, we design a polynomial proximal operator to address the semidefinite conic constraints and apply the quantum singular value transformation to accelerate the most costly projection updates. We prove that the scheme converges to an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution of the SDP problem under the strong duality assumption.

Further important examples are cellular automata and differential analyzers. While analog computers offer many advantages, they lack a notion of universality akin to universal digital computers. Since analog computers are best formalized as dynamical systems, we review scattered results on universal dynamical systems, identifying four senses of universality and connecting to coalgebra and domain theory. For nondeterministic systems, we construct a universal system as a Fra\\\"iss\\'e limit. It not only is universal in many of the identified senses, it also is unique in additionally being homogeneous. For deterministic systems, a universal system cannot exist, but we provide a simple method for constructing subclasses of deterministic systems with a universal and homogeneous system. This way, we introduce sofic proshifts: those systems that are limits of sofic shifts. In fact, their universal and homogeneous system even is a limit of shifts of finite type and has the shadowing property.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10184","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.214385","language":"en","tags":["mathds","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Levin Hornischer","raw_content_length":1182,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Universal Analog Computation"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1181,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["dynamical systems","Universal Analog Computation","Fraisse limits","analog computers","arXiv251010184v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Analog computation","an alternative","digital computation","gained prominence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fraisse limits"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"dynamical systems":3.0,"Universal Analog Computation":2.0,"Fraisse limits":2.0,"analog computers":2.0,"arXiv251010184v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Analog computation":1.0,"an alternative":1.0,"digital computation":1.0,"gained prominence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7836331355555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8625,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8774,"joy":0.0264,"surprise":0.056,"sadness":0.008,"fear":0.0073,"anger":0.0115,"disgust":0.0134},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on analog computation and universality in dynamical systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_e66754af7823","title":"Average Kernel Sizes -","content":"arXiv:2510.10229v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The reconstruction of an unknown quantity from noisy measurements is a mathematical problem relevant in most applied sciences, for example, in medical imaging, radar inverse scattering, or astronomy. This underlying mathematical problem is often an ill-posed (non-linear) reconstruction problem, referred to as an ill-posed inverse problem. To tackle such problems, there exist a myriad of methods to design approximate inverse maps, ranging from optimization-based approaches, such as compressed sensing, over Bayesian approaches, to data-driven techniques such as deep learning. For all stable approximate inverse maps, there are accuracy limits that are strictly larger than zero for ill-posed inverse problems, due to the accuracy-stability tradeoff [Gottschling et al., SIAM Review, 67.1 (2025)] and [Colbrook et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 119.12 (2022)]. The variety of methods that aim to solve such problems begs for a unifying approach to help scientists choose the approximate inverse map that obtains this theoretical optimum. Up to now there do not exist computable accuracy bounds to this optimum that are applicable to all inverse problems. We provide computable sharp accuracy bounds to the reconstruction error of solution methods to inverse problems. The bounds are method-independent and purely depend on the dataset of signals, the forward model of the inverse problem, and the noise model. To facilitate the use in scientific applications, we provide an algorithmic framework and an accompanying software library to compute these accuracy bounds. We demonstrate the validity of the algorithms on two inverse problems from different domains: fluorescence localization microscopy and super-resolution of multi-spectral satellite data. Computing the accuracy bounds for a problem before solving it, enables a fundamental shift towards optimizing datasets and forward models.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10229","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.217655","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":281,"author":"Nina M.

In this framework, an agent chooses a stopping rule motivated by two objectives: robust decision-making under ambiguity and learning about the unknown environment. Here, ambiguity refers to considering multiple probability measures dominated by a reference measure, reflecting the agent's awareness that the reference measure representing her learned belief about the environment would be erroneous. Using the $g$-expectation framework, we reformulate an optimal stopping problem under ambiguity as an entropy-regularized optimal control problem under ambiguity, with Bernoulli distributed controls to incorporate exploration into the stopping rules. We then derive the optimal Bernoulli distributed control characterized by backward stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we establish a policy iteration theorem and implement it as a reinforcement learning algorithm.

Hamilton asserts that any convex hypersurface in an Euclidian space with pinched second fundamental form must be compact. Partly inspired by this result, twenty years ago, in \\cite{Ancient}, Remark 3.1 on page 650, the author formulated a problem asking if a complete Riemannian manifold with positively pinched Ricci curvature must be compact. There are several recent progresses, which are all rigidity results concerning the flat metric except the special case for the steady solitons. In this note we provide a detailed alternate proof of Hamilton's result, in view of the recent proof via the mean curvature flow requiring additional assumptions and that the original argument by Hamilton does lack of complete details. The proof uses a result of the author in 1998 concerning quasi-conformal maps. The proof here allows a generalization as well. We dedicate this article to commemorate R. Hamilton, the creator of the Ricci flow, who also made fundamental contributions to many other geometric flows.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10279","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.221164","language":"en","tags":["mathdg","research","mathematics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Lei Ni","raw_content_length":1070,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.83,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Hamilton"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1069,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a complete Riemannian manifold","positively pinched Ricci curvature compact","Announce Type","new Abstract","A result","R Hamilton","any convex hypersurface","an Euclidian space","pinched second fundamental form","this result"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a complete Riemannian manifold":3.0,"positively pinched Ricci curvature compact":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A result":1.0,"R Hamilton":1.0,"any convex hypersurface":1.0,"an Euclidian space":1.0,"pinched second fundamental form":1.0,"this result":1.0}},"age_hours":2.783872209444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.955,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.791,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7421,"joy":0.0258,"surprise":0.1817,"sadness":0.01,"fear":0.0089,"anger":0.0233,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a theoretical mathematics paper concerning Riemannian manifolds and Ricci curvature.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_4a4d9f647855","title":"Distance mutual","content":"arXiv:2510.10284v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The concept of mutual-visibility (MV) has been extended in several directions. A vertex subset $S$ of a graph $G$ is a $k$-distance mutual-visibility ($k$DMV) set if for any two vertices in $S$, there is a geodesic between them of length at most $k$ whose internal vertices are not in $S$. In this paper, we combine this with the MV coloring as follows. For any integer $k\\geq1$, a $k$DMV coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$DMV sets, and the $k$DMV chromatic number $\\chi_{\\mu_k}(G)$ is the minimum cardinality of such a partition. When $k=1$ or $k\\ge {\\rm diam}(G)$, it equals the clique cover number $\\theta(G)$ or the MV chromatic number $\\chi_{\\mu}(G)$, respectively. So, our attention is given to $1<{\\rm diam}(G)$ with $k=2$ producing the most interesting results. We prove that $\\chi_{\\mu_2}(G)\\le|V(G)|/2$ and present large families of graphs that attain the bound. In addition, $\\chi_{\\mu_2}(G)$ is bounded from above by the total domination number $\\gamma_t(G)$ if $G$ is isolate-free, while in graphs $G$ with girth $g(G)\\geq7$, $\\chi_{\\mu_2}(G)$ is bounded from below by the domination number $\\gamma(G)$. A surprising relation with the exact distance-2 graphs is found, which results in $\\theta(G^{[\\natural2]})=\\gamma_{t}(G)$ for any isolate-free graph $G$ with $g(G)\\geq7$. The relation is explored further in lexicographic product graphs, where we prove the sharp inequalities $\\chi_{\\mu_{2}}(G\\circ H)\\leq \\theta(G^{[\\natural2]})\\leq \\theta\\big{(}(G\\circ H)^{[\\natural2]}\\big{)}$. We also prove a sharp lower (resp. upper) bound on $\\chi_{\\mu_2}$ (resp. $\\chi_{\\mu_k}$) for the Cartesian (resp. strong) product of two connected graphs and show that they are widely sharp. Finally, we characterize the block graphs $G$ with $\\chi_{\\mu_k}(G)=\\chi_{\\mu}(G)$, where $k={\\rm diam}(G)-1$.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10284","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.222005","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":264,"author":"Saneesh Babu, Bo\\v{s}tjan Bre\\v{s}ar, Aparna Lakshmanan S, Babak Samadi","raw_content_length":1862,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.32,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\chi_{\\mu_k}(G)$","\\theta(G)$","S$.","$\\chi_{\\mu_2}(G)\\le|V(G)|/2$","\\chi_{\\mu_2}(G)$","$k=1$","k$DMV","$1<{\\rm diam}(G)$"]},"char_count":1861,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Distance","arXiv251010284v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","The concept","mutual-visibility","several directions","A vertex","a graph","a k-distance mutual-visibility"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Distance":2.0,"arXiv251010284v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The concept":1.0,"mutual-visibility":1.0,"several directions":1.0,"A vertex":1.0,"a graph":1.0,"a k-distance mutual-visibility":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7839039694444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9235,"joy":0.013,"surprise":0.0446,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0024,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on graph theory, specifically distance mutual-visibility coloring.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_32610af324c0","title":"The smallest $n$","content":"arXiv:2510.10349v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce the notion of $n$-pure geometric morphism between Grothendieck toposes, over a Grothendieck base topos $\\mathcal{T}$. This is a higher-dimensional analogue of the concepts of dense and pure geometric morphism. We extend the construction of the smallest dense subtopos and smallest pure subtopos by constructing a smallest $n$-pure subtopos, for each natural number $n$. Based on this, we then propose a concept of dimension for a Grothendieck topos, in this way also arriving naturally at a distinction between toposes with boundary and toposes without boundary. We show that the zero-dimensional toposes without boundary are precisely the Boolean toposes, and that the topos associated to an $n$-manifold is again $n$-dimensional (with boundary if the manifold has a boundary). Some other toposes for which we calculate the dimension are the topos associated to the rational line and the toposes associated to a right Ore monoid or free monoid. Finally, we move to algebraic geometry: for a scheme $X$ of characteristic $0$ and Krull dimension $d$, we prove that the dimension of the associated petit \\'etale topos is $2d$, assuming that $X$ is excellent and regular, or that $X$ is variety. As a first example in mixed characteristic, we show that the petit \\'etale topos associated to $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is two-dimensional.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10349","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.227353","language":"en","tags":["mathgn","mathct","mathag","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Jens Hemelaer","raw_content_length":1397,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Grothendieck","arXiv:2510.10349v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\mathcal{T}$.","n$."]},"char_count":1396,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The smallest n","new Abstract","the notion","n-pure geometric morphism","Grothendieck toposes","a Grothendieck base topos","mathcalT","a higher-dimensional analogue","the concepts","dense and pure geometric morphism"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The smallest n":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the notion":1.0,"n-pure geometric morphism":1.0,"Grothendieck toposes":1.0,"a Grothendieck base topos":1.0,"mathcalT":1.0,"a higher-dimensional analogue":1.0,"the concepts":1.0,"dense and pure geometric morphism":1.0}},"age_hours":2.784094062222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8793,"joy":0.024,"surprise":0.0676,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0048,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.
