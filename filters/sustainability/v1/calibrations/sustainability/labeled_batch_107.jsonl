Using Huber regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges: (i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth $f^\\star$, which is $\\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a \\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition under weak $(1+\\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction error up to a residual of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma^{-2\\epsilon})$, clarifying the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\\sigma$. Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust learning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.584230","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Yunlong Feng, Qiang Wu","raw_content_length":1858,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RKHS"],"persons":["L_2$-distance","Hilbert"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1857,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robust Machine Learning","Nonparametric Regression","Heavy","new Abstract","robust nonparametric regression","the presence","heavy-tailed noise","the hypothesis class","unbounded functions","robustness"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Robust Machine Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robust Machine Learning":2.0,"Nonparametric Regression":2.0,"Heavy":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"robust nonparametric regression":1.0,"the presence":1.0,"heavy-tailed noise":1.0,"the hypothesis class":1.0,"unbounded functions":1.0,"robustness":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7464104783333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9101,"joy":0.0107,"surprise":0.0275,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0202,"anger":0.0144,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on robust machine learning techniques.

Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast. However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological mean adjusted forecasts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.584656","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","csai","physicsao-ph","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Parsa Gooya, Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso","raw_content_length":1471,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Arctic Sea Ice Concentration","Arctic sea"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1470,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Probabilistic bias adjustment","seasonal predictions","Arctic Sea Ice Concentration","Announce Type","new Abstract","Seasonal forecast","Arctic sea ice concentration","the negative impact","potential opportunities","the rapid decline"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Probabilistic bias adjustment":2.0,"seasonal predictions":2.0,"Arctic Sea Ice Concentration":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Seasonal forecast":1.0,"Arctic sea ice concentration":1.0,"the negative impact":1.0,"potential opportunities":1.0,"the rapid decline":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7464248013888892,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.7570000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6486,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8321,"joy":0.0044,"surprise":0.0351,"sadness":0.0233,"fear":0.0522,"anger":0.0267,"disgust":0.0263},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new method for improving the accuracy of Arctic sea ice concentration forecasts.

We first propose a simplified intersection point formula with improved speed and numerical robustness over the ones traditionally implemented in geoscience software. We then show how algorithms based on the concept of error-free transformations (EFT) can be applied to evaluate this formula within a relative error bound that is on the order of machine precision. We demonstrate that, with a vectorized and parallelized implementation, this enhanced accuracy is achieved with no compute-time overhead compared to a direct calculation in hardware floating point, making our algorithm suitable for performance-sensitive applications like regridding of high-resolution climate data. In contrast, evaluating our formula using high-precision data types like quadruple precision and arbitrary precision, or using the robust intersection computation routines from the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL), leads to significant computational overhead, especially since these alternatives inhibit vectorization. More generally, our work demonstrates how EFT techniques can be combined and extended to implement nontrivial geometric calculations with high accuracy and speed.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09892","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.585047","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Hongyu Chen, Paul A.

This paper presents HIPPD, a brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09893","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.585434","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Guanming Chen, Lingzhi Shen, Xiaohao Cai, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel","raw_content_length":1247,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HIPPD"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1246,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HIPPD","Brain","arXiv251009893v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Personality detection","text","an individuals personality traits","linguistic patterns","existing machine learning approaches","contextual information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Brain","existing machine learning approaches"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HIPPD":3.0,"Brain":2.0,"arXiv251009893v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Personality detection":1.0,"text":1.0,"an individuals personality traits":1.0,"linguistic patterns":1.0,"existing machine learning approaches":1.0,"contextual information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7464539480555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8764,"joy":0.0062,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0095,"fear":0.0315,"anger":0.0267,"disgust":0.0278},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI framework (HIPPD) for personality detection.

Among them, the AlphaEarth Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that integrate both physical form and functional meaning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09894","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.585874","language":"en","tags":["cslg","cscy","csai","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Junyuan Liu, Quan Qin, Guangsheng Dong, Xinglei Wang, Jiazhuang Feng, Zichao Zeng, Tao Cheng","raw_content_length":1690,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.065,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Earth Observation","AlphaEarth-POI Enriched Representation Learning","the AlphaEarth Foundation","Points of Interest"],"persons":["AETHER","Announce Type"],"locations":["Earth"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1689,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["AlphaEarth","arXiv251009894v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","General-purpose spatial representations","transferable geospatial foundation models","GFMs","them","the AlphaEarth Foundation","a major step","a global unified representation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"AlphaEarth":2.0,"arXiv251009894v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"General-purpose spatial representations":1.0,"transferable geospatial foundation models":1.0,"GFMs":1.0,"them":1.0,"the AlphaEarth Foundation":1.0,"a major step":1.0,"a global unified representation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746469106666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9096,"joy":0.0183,"surprise":0.0451,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.0095,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a framework (AETHER) that improves land-use classification and socioeconomic mapping by enriching Earth Observation data with POI information.

We propose $\\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature interactions.

This design enables the tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in predictive accuracy.

The two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited. Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge). Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50% on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100% on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster than the baseline.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09898","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.587117","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Hung Phan, Son Le Vu, Ali Jannesari","raw_content_length":1588,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","PyTorch","TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien","JAX","CodeParrot"],"persons":["Learning Bug Context","Wolf"],"locations":["Python"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1587,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PyTorch","Bug Context","JAX","arXiv251009898v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","recent progress","large language models","LLMs","code translation","mainstream languages"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PyTorch":3.0,"Bug Context":2.0,"JAX":2.0,"arXiv251009898v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"recent progress":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"code translation":1.0,"mainstream languages":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7465155330555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.5305000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9107,"joy":0.0075,"surprise":0.0385,"sadness":0.0131,"fear":0.0072,"anger":0.0081,"disgust":0.015},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a framework for improving code translation between PyTorch and JAX, resulting in potentially faster code execution (2.5x faster).

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_3032c506e6cd","title":"Uncertainty","content":"arXiv:2510.11346v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution. This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene experiment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11346","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.946986","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Joshua Niemeijer, Jan Ehrhardt, Heinz Handels, Hristina Uzunova","raw_content_length":1943,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ControlNets","ControlNet"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1940,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Uncertainty","the original training distribution","Announce Type","new Abstract","Generative Models","a valuable tool","the controlled creation","high-quality image data","Controlled diffusion models","the ControlNet"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Uncertainty"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Uncertainty":2.0,"the original training distribution":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Generative Models":1.0,"a valuable tool":1.0,"the controlled creation":1.0,"high-quality image data":1.0,"Controlled diffusion models":1.0,"the ControlNet":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758471879722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8283,"joy":0.0236,"surprise":0.0213,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.0665,"anger":0.0234,"disgust":0.0293},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for improving the training of semantic segmentation models using synthetic data generated with uncertainty-guided ControlNets.

Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09904","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.588314","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","mathoc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Kelvin Kan, Xingjian Li, Benjamin J.

As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical. We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning.

Users specify the input domain for their test using combinators supplied by the PBT framework, and the expected properties or invariants as a unit-test function. The framework then searches for a counterexample, e.g. by generating inputs and calling the test function. In this work, we demonstrate an LLM-based agent which analyzes Python modules, infers function-specific and cross-function properties from code and documentation, synthesizes and executes PBTs, reflects on outputs of these tests to confirm true bugs, and finally outputs actionable bug reports for the developer. We perform an extensive evaluation of our agent across 100 popular Python packages. Of the bug reports generated by the agent, we found after manual review that 56\\% were valid bugs and 32\\% were valid bugs that we would report to maintainers. We then developed a ranking rubric to surface high-priority valid bugs to developers, and found that of the 21 top-scoring bugs, 86\\% were valid and 81\\% we would report. The bugs span diverse failure modes from serialization failures to numerical precision errors to flawed cache implementations. We reported 5 bugs, 4 with patches, including to NumPy and cloud computing SDKs, with 3 patches merged successfully.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking. The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient.

We aim to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to ``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks, reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that are otherwise discarded.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09913","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.590546","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Shangbin Feng, Wenhao Yu, Yike Wang, Hongming Zhang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Dong Yu","raw_content_length":1454,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Switch Generation"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1453,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Your Pretrained Model","arXiv251009913v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Alignment training","tradeoffs","language models","LMs","reasoning","instruction","skills"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Your Pretrained Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Your Pretrained Model":2.0,"arXiv251009913v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Alignment training":1.0,"tradeoffs":1.0,"language models":1.0,"LMs":1.0,"reasoning":1.0,"instruction":1.0,"skills":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746634826666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.63,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.926,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8415,"joy":0.0469,"surprise":0.0048,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.032,"anger":0.0392,"disgust":0.0273},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores a method to improve the efficiency of large language models by reusing and repurposing different models in the training pipeline, potentially reducing the computational resources and energy required for training new models.

In this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model), a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease mechanisms.

However, despite their ability to generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries, introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent, unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09915","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.591343","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Sicong Huang, Qianqi Yan, Shengze Wang, Ian Lane","raw_content_length":1512,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1511,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Faithfulness","Abstractive Summarization","Span","arXiv251009915v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Abstractive summarization","large language models","LLMs","an essential tool","information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Faithfulness","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Faithfulness":2.0,"Abstractive Summarization":2.0,"Span":2.0,"arXiv251009915v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Abstractive summarization":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"an essential tool":1.0,"information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746664749722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.1770000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2354,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7606,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0028,"sadness":0.0259,"fear":0.0281,"anger":0.0637,"disgust":0.1115},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes research into improving the faithfulness of abstractive summarization using LLMs. While the research shows improved faithfulness using span-level annotations, it is still in the applied research stage with no deployed units or customer contracts.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9338383bb71d","title":"HeadsUp! High","content":"arXiv:2510.09924v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration, reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both general image and aligned face datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09924","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.592574","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Renjie Li, Zihao Zhu, Xiaoyu Wang, Zhengzhong Tu","raw_content_length":1662,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type","HeadsUp"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1661,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["resolution","arXiv251009924v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Portrait pictures","which","both human subjects","natural backgrounds","the most prevalent forms","photography"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Portrait pictures"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"resolution":2.0,"arXiv251009924v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Portrait pictures":1.0,"which":1.0,"both human subjects":1.0,"natural backgrounds":1.0,"the most prevalent forms":1.0,"photography":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7467113602777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.0995,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4199,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.928,"joy":0.0125,"surprise":0.0231,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0131,"anger":0.014,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new image super-resolution technique.

We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages. First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable feature in audio processing applications.

Traditionally, these frameworks have been viewed as distinct, with the former focusing on optimally safe controller design and the latter providing sufficient conditions for safety. A previous work introduced the notion of a control barrier value function (CB-VF), which is defined similarly to the other value functions studied in HJR but has certain CBF-like properties. In this work, we proceed the other direction by generalizing CBFs to non-differentiable ``viscosity'' CBFs. We show the deep connection between viscosity CBFs and CB-VFs, bridging the CBF and HJR frameworks. Through this bridge, we characterize the viscosity CBFs as precisely those functions which provide CBF-like safety guarantees (control invariance and smooth approach to the boundary). We then further show nice theoretical properties of viscosity CBFs, including their desirable closure under maximum and limit operations. In the process, we also extend CB-VFs to non-exponential anti-discounting and update the corresponding theory for CB-VFs along these lines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09929","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.593797","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Dylan Hirsch, Jaime Fern\\'andez Fisac, Sylvia Herbert","raw_content_length":1203,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hamilton","HJR","CBF","the Control Barrier Function"],"persons":["Hamilton-Jacobi"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1202,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Viscosity CBFs","the Control Barrier Function","Hamilton","HJR","arXiv251009929v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Control barrier functions","CBFs","Hamilton-Jacobi reachability","central frameworks"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Viscosity CBFs":2.0,"the Control Barrier Function":2.0,"Hamilton":2.0,"HJR":2.0,"arXiv251009929v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Control barrier functions":1.0,"CBFs":1.0,"Hamilton-Jacobi reachability":1.0,"central frameworks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7467549477777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3445,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8689,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9334,"joy":0.0167,"surprise":0.0276,"sadness":0.003,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0096,"disgust":0.0036},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical advancement in control barrier functions, potentially improving the safety and efficiency of control systems.

Effective segmentation in these settings requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09930","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.594214","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Ching Chang, Ming-Chih Lo, Chiao-Tung Chan, Wen-Chih Peng, Tien-Fu Chen","raw_content_length":1700,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Iterative Multi arXiv:2510.09930v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1699,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MemPromptTSS"," Persistent Prompt Memory","Iterative Multi","Announce Type","new Abstract","Web platforms","mobile applications","connected sensing systems","multivariate time series","states"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MemPromptTSS":2.0," Persistent Prompt Memory":2.0,"Iterative Multi":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Web platforms":1.0,"mobile applications":1.0,"connected sensing systems":1.0,"multivariate time series":1.0,"states":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7467692205555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.934,"joy":0.0113,"surprise":0.0341,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0034,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0045},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework (MemPromptTSS) for time series segmentation with improved accuracy in wearable sensing and industrial monitoring.

These compilers rely on existing CPU and GPU code generation backends to generate device-specific code. Recently, many tensor accelerators (neural processing units) have been proposed to further accelerate these workloads. Compared to commodity hardware, however, most of the proposed tensor accelerators do not have compiler backends with code generation support. Moreover, the accelerator designs are subject to fast iteration cycles, making it difficult to manually develop compiler backends similar to commodity hardware platforms. Therefore, to increase adoption and enable faster software development cycles for novel tensor accelerator designs, we need to make the compiler backend construction process more agile. To address this gap, we introduce ACT, a compiler backend generator that automatically generates compiler backends for tensor accelerators, given just the instruction set architecture (ISA) descriptions. We first formally specify the compiler backend generation problem that introduces a novel specification for describing tensor accelerator ISAs. Next, we design ACT such that it supports user-programmable memories and complex parameterized instructions that are prevalent in tensor accelerators. ACT uses a novel parameterized equality saturation-based instruction selection phase and a constraint programming-based memory allocation phase. We prove that compiler backends generated by ACT are sound and complete. Finally, we generate compiler backends for three accelerator platforms from industry and academia, and show that they match or outperform code written using hand-optimized kernel libraries while maintaining low compilation overheads.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09932","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.594662","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csar","cspl","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":244,"author":"Devansh Jain, Akash Pardeshi, Marco Frigo, Krut Patel, Kaustubh Khulbe, Jai Arora, Charith Mendis","raw_content_length":1829,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.22,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ISA Descriptions arXiv:2510.09932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","CPU","GPU","Tensor Accelerator"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1826,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ACT","Compiler Backends","Tensor Accelerator ISA Descriptions","new Abstract","Tensor compilers","a key role","high-performance implementations","deep learning workloads","These compilers","device-specific code"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep learning workloads"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ACT":2.0,"Compiler Backends":2.0,"Tensor Accelerator ISA Descriptions":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Tensor compilers":1.0,"a key role":1.0,"high-performance implementations":1.0,"deep learning workloads":1.0,"These compilers":1.0,"device-specific code":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7467844833333332,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8883,"joy":0.0147,"surprise":0.0767,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.0029,"anger":0.0113,"disgust":0.0029},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a compiler backend generator (ACT) that automates the creation of compiler backends for tensor accelerators, potentially leading to faster software development cycles and increased adoption of novel accelerator designs.

However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09936","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.595881","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Agampreet Aulakh, Nils D.

However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE) paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator.

In practice, some errors can be fixed using original-precision arithmetic, while others require high-precision computation. Developers often avoid addressing the latter due to excessive computational resources required. However, they sometimes struggle to distinguish between these two types of errors, and existing repair tools fail to assist in this differentiation. Most current repair tools rely on high-precision implementations, which are time-consuming to develop and demand specialized expertise. Although a few tools do not require high-precision programs, they can only fix a limited subset of errors or produce suboptimal results. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, named OFP-Repair.On ACESO's dataset, our patches achieve improvements of three, seven, three, and eight orders of magnitude across four accuracy metrics. In real-world cases, our method successfully detects all five original-precision-repairable errors and fixes three, whereas ACESO only repairs one. Notably, these results are based on verified data and do not fully capture the potential of OFP-Repair. To further validate our method, we deploy it on a decade-old open bug report from GNU Scientific Library (GSL), successfully repairing five out of 15 bugs. The developers have expressed interest in our method and are considering integrating our tool into their development workflow. We are currently working on applying our patches to GSL. The results are highly encouraging, demonstrating the practical applicability of our technique.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09938","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.596735","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Youshuai Tan, Zishuo Ding, Jinfu Chen, Weiyi Shang","raw_content_length":1790,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ACE","OFP-Repair: Repairing","OFP-Repair"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1787,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["OFP-Repair","arXiv251009938v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Errors","floating-point programs","severe consequences","critical domains","military","aerospace","financial systems"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["OFP-Repair"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"OFP-Repair":2.0,"arXiv251009938v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Errors":1.0,"floating-point programs":1.0,"severe consequences":1.0,"critical domains":1.0,"military":1.0,"aerospace":1.0,"financial systems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746860351388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.41700000000000015,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9166,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6198,"joy":0.0043,"surprise":0.0145,"sadness":0.1259,"fear":0.0545,"anger":0.0909,"disgust":0.0902},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (OFP-Repair) for fixing errors in floating-point programs, demonstrating improvements in accuracy metrics on ACESO's dataset and successfully repairing bugs in GNU Scientific Library.

Specifically, we consider these impacts within the context of an arrival scenario with two converging flows: a straight-in approach stream and a downwind stream merging into it. Both arrival stream are modeled using a modified Possion distribution that incorporate the separation minima as well as the runway occupancy time. Various system level uncertainties are addressed in this process, including communication link- and human-related uncertainties. In this research, we first build a Monte Carlo-based discrete-time simulation, where aircraft arrivals are generated by modified Poisson processes subject to minimum separation constraints, simulating various traffic operations. The merging logic incorporates standard bank angle continuous turn-to-final, pilot response delays, and dynamic gap availability in real time. Then, we investigate an automated final approach vectoring model (i.e., Auto-ATC), in which inverse optimal control is used to learn decision advisories from human expert records. By augmenting trajectories and incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties into the planning scenario, we create a setup analogous to the discrete event simulation. For both studies, runway capacity is measured by runway throughput, the fraction of downwind arrivals that merge immediately without holding, and the average delay (i.e., holding time/distance) experienced on the downwind leg. This research provides a method for runway capacity estimation in merging scenarios, and demonstrates that aeronautical communication link uncertainties significantly affect runway capacity in current voice-based operations, whereas the impact can be mitigated in autonomous operational settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09943","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.597960","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Yutian Pang, Andrew Kendall, John-Paul Clarke","raw_content_length":1857,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Impact of Communication and Human Uncertainties on Runway Capacity"],"persons":["Announce Type","Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1856,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Impact","Communication","Human Uncertainties","Runway Capacity","Terminal Airspace","arXiv251009943v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the potential impact","communication","human performance uncertainties"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Human Uncertainties"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Impact":2.0,"Communication":2.0,"Human Uncertainties":2.0,"Runway Capacity":2.0,"Terminal Airspace":2.0,"arXiv251009943v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the potential impact":1.0,"communication":1.0,"human performance uncertainties":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746906163333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0705,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5859,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7989,"joy":0.0077,"surprise":0.0204,"sadness":0.0121,"fear":0.1292,"anger":0.0207,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research models the impact of communication uncertainties on runway capacity, specifically focusing on runway throughput, fraction of downwind arrivals that merge immediately, and average delay.

In this study, we investigate how the integration of an AI teammate -- a fully autonomous GPT-4 agent with social, cognitive, and affective capabilities -- shapes the socio-cognitive dynamics of CPS. We analyze discourse data collected from human-AI teaming (HAT) experiments conducted on a novel platform specifically designed for HAT research. Using two natural language processing (NLP) methods, specifically Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Group Communication Analysis (GCA), we found that AI teammates often assumed the role of dominant cognitive facilitators, guiding, planning, and driving group decision-making. However, they did so in a socially detached manner, frequently pushing agenda in a verbose and repetitive way. By contrast, humans working with AI used more language reflecting social processes, suggesting that they assumed more socially oriented roles.

We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

If the structure $H$ is fixed and $G$ is the only input, the problem is denoted $CSP(H)$. In its counting version, $\\#CSP(H)$, the task is to find the number of such homomorphisms. The CSP and #CSP have been used to model a wide variety of combinatorial problems and have received a tremendous amount of attention from researchers from multiple disciplines. In this paper we consider the modular version of the counting CSPs, that is, problems of the form $\\#_pCSP(H)$ of counting the number of homomorphisms to $H$ modulo a fixed prime number $p$. Modular counting has been intensively studied during the last decade, although mainly in the case of graph homomorphisms. Here we continue the program of systematic research of modular counting of homomorphisms to general relational structures. The main results of the paper include a new way of reducing modular counting problems to smaller domains and a study of the complexity of such problems over 3-element domains and over conservative domains, that is, relational structures that allow to express (in a certain exact way) every possible unary predicate.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09950","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.600025","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cslo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Andrei A.

Due to the complexity of HTTP and vendor design decisions, these proxies sometimes process a given request in different ways. Attackers can exploit these processing discrepancies to launch damaging attacks including web cache poisoning and request smuggling. Discrepancy attacks are surging, yet, there exists no systemic defense. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive defense to address this problem, called HTTP Request Synchronization. Our scheme uses standard HTTP extension mechanisms to augment each request with a complete processing history. It propagates this context through the traffic path detailing how each server hop has processed said request. Using this history, every proxy server can validate that their processing is consistent with all previous hops, eliminating discrepancy attacks. We implement our scheme for 5 popular proxy technologies, Apache, NGINX, HAProxy, Varnish, and Cloudflare, demonstrating its practical impact.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09952","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.600405","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Cem Topcuoglu, Kaan Onarlioglu, Steven Sprecher, Engin Kirda","raw_content_length":1112,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HTTP Request Synchronization"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1109,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HTTP Request Synchronization Defeats Discrepancy Attacks","arXiv251009952v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Contemporary web application architectures","many layers","proxy services","traffic","the complexity","HTTP","vendor design decisions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HTTP Request Synchronization Defeats Discrepancy Attacks":2.0,"arXiv251009952v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Contemporary web application architectures":1.0,"many layers":1.0,"proxy services":1.0,"traffic":1.0,"the complexity":1.0,"HTTP":1.0,"vendor design decisions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.746999057777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.121,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9758,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.285,"joy":0.0038,"surprise":0.0113,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.2562,"anger":0.3164,"disgust":0.117},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel defense against web application attacks by synchronizing HTTP requests across proxy layers.

More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering (CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix. A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_02cf342dee8b","title":"LLM","content":"arXiv:2509.25626v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25626","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.292747","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csar","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":273,"author":"Yi Hu (North Carolina State University), Huiyang Zhou (North Carolina State University)","raw_content_length":1885,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.365,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GPU"],"persons":["Gaussian"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1884,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLM","arXiv250925626v2 Announce Type","Abstract","3D Gaussian","3DGS","a transformative technique","profound implications","novel view synthesis","real-time rendering","its importance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLM":2.0,"arXiv250925626v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"3D Gaussian":1.0,"3DGS":1.0,"a transformative technique":1.0,"profound implications":1.0,"novel view synthesis":1.0,"real-time rendering":1.0,"its importance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7707578425,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.5765,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9153,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7997,"joy":0.0195,"surprise":0.1431,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0169,"anger":0.0096,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores using LLMs to optimize GPU kernels for 3D Gaussian splatting, achieving speedups of up to 42% compared to the original code.

We propose Homomorphic Policy Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation.

While some smoothing-based LO methods have been proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09966","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.602881","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Easton R.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_803275ece637","title":"Operationalizing AI: Empirical Evidence on MLOps Practices, User Satisfaction, and Organizational Context","content":"arXiv:2510.09968v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Organizational efforts to utilize and operationalize artificial intelligence (AI) are often accompanied by substantial challenges, including scalability, maintenance, and coordination across teams. In response, the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as a set of best practices that integrate software engineering principles with the unique demands of managing the ML lifecycle. Yet, empirical evidence on whether and how these practices support users in developing and operationalizing AI applications remains limited. To address this gap, this study analyzes over 8,000 user reviews of AI development platforms from G2.com. Using zero-shot classification, we measure review sentiment toward nine established MLOps practices, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, and monitoring. Seven of the nine practices show a significant positive relationship with user satisfaction, suggesting that effective MLOps implementation contributes tangible value to AI development. However, organizational context also matters: reviewers from small firms discuss certain MLOps practices less frequently, suggesting that organizational context influences the prevalence and salience of MLOps, though firm size does not moderate the MLOps-satisfaction link.

This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System 2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making, highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address LLM reasoning deficits.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09970","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.603709","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Olivia Peiyu Wang, Tashvi Bansal, Ryan Bai, Emily M.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a420342c7a15","title":"Universal Discrete","content":"arXiv:2510.09974v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In real-world scenarios, speech signals are inevitably corrupted by various types of interference, making speech enhancement (SE) a critical task for robust speech processing. However, most existing SE methods only handle a limited range of distortions, such as additive noise, reverberation, or band limitation, while the study of SE under multiple simultaneous distortions remains limited. This gap affects the generalization and practical usability of SE methods in real-world environments.To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel Universal Discrete-domain SE model called UDSE.Unlike regression-based SE models that directly predict clean speech waveform or continuous features, UDSE redefines SE as a discrete-domain classification task, instead predicting the clean discrete tokens quantized by the residual vector quantizer (RVQ) of a pre-trained neural speech codec.Specifically, UDSE first extracts global features from the degraded speech. Guided by these global features, the clean token prediction for each VQ follows the rules of RVQ, where the prediction of each VQ relies on the results of the preceding ones. Finally, the predicted clean tokens from all VQs are decoded to reconstruct the clean speech waveform. During training, the UDSE model employs a teacher-forcing strategy, and is optimized with cross-entropy loss. Experimental results confirm that the proposed UDSE model can effectively enhance speech degraded by various conventional and unconventional distortions, e.g., additive noise, reverberation, band limitation, clipping, phase distortion, and compression distortion, as well as their combinations. These results demonstrate the superior universality and practicality of UDSE compared to advanced regression-based SE methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09974","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.604130","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","research","cssd","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Fei Liu, Yang Ai, Ye-Xin Lu, Rui-Chen Zheng, Hui-Peng Du, Zhen-Hua Ling","raw_content_length":1816,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Universal Discrete-domain","RVQ","Universal Discrete arXiv:2510.09974v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1815,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Universal Discrete","arXiv251009974v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","real-world scenarios","speech signals","various types","interference","speech enhancement","a critical task","robust speech processing"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Universal Discrete":2.0,"arXiv251009974v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"real-world scenarios":1.0,"speech signals":1.0,"various types":1.0,"interference":1.0,"speech enhancement":1.0,"a critical task":1.0,"robust speech processing":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7471362930555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7457,"joy":0.0044,"surprise":0.0498,"sadness":0.0211,"fear":0.062,"anger":0.0388,"disgust":0.0783},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel speech enhancement model (UDSE) that could potentially reduce energy consumption in speech processing applications by improving efficiency and reducing the need for re-transmission of corrupted signals.

Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However, conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\\pi_0$ model by integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency, clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned, diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\\pi_0$-FAST baselines, observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09976","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.604579","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Mingyang Lyu, Yinqian Sun, Erliang Lin, Huangrui Li, Ruolin Chen, Feifei Zhao, Yi Zeng","raw_content_length":1826,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Vision-Language-Action","FPO"],"persons":["Octo"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\pi_0$"]},"char_count":1825,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reinforcement Fine-Tuning","Flow-Matching Policies","Vision","Announce Type","new Abstract","VLA","OpenVLA","Octo","strong generalization","large-scale demonstrations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Vision"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reinforcement Fine-Tuning":2.0,"Flow-Matching Policies":2.0,"Vision":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"VLA":1.0,"OpenVLA":1.0,"Octo":1.0,"strong generalization":1.0,"large-scale demonstrations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7471517925,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2775,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8555,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9027,"joy":0.0066,"surprise":0.028,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.0116,"anger":0.0197,"disgust":0.0217},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning algorithm (FPO) for fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action models.

However, widespread sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09981","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.605813","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","computer-science","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Fan Zuo, Donglin Zhou, Jingqin Gao, Kaan Ozbay","raw_content_length":1963,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Language Model"],"locations":["New York City's"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1962,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Traffic Insights","AI and Language Model","arXiv251009981v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","scalable traffic monitoring","real-time and long-term transportation management","disruptions","natural disasters","large construction projects","major policy changes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI and Language Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Traffic Insights":2.0,"AI and Language Model":2.0,"arXiv251009981v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"scalable traffic monitoring":1.0,"real-time and long-term transportation management":1.0,"disruptions":1.0,"natural disasters":1.0,"large construction projects":1.0,"major policy changes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7471974258333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8064999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6387,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9189,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0294,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0228,"anger":0.0087,"disgust":0.0043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed AI system analyzing traffic camera data to monitor the impact of NYC's congestion pricing.

Emerging solutions, such as Delegated Credentials (RFC 9345), lack fine-grained definitions of many critical aspects of delegation, such as the length of delegation chains, revocation mechanism, permitted operations, and a well-defined scope for said delegation. We present Delegation Certificates (DeCerts), which modify X.509 certificate standard and add new extensions to enable fine-grained CDN delegation. DeCerts allow domain owners to specify delegated and non-delegated subdomains, and control the depth of delegation extended by CDNs, which provides flexibility in delegation management. But more importantly, DeCerts are built on a new principle which provides full autonomy to domain owners-domain owners can issue DeCerts fully independent of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and thus have greater flexibility in policy control, including revocation methods. Such level of flexibility would be hard to match if CAs where to issue such certificates. Revoking a DeCert revokes delegation. We discuss multiple revocation mechanisms for a DeCerts balancing security, performance, and delegator control. We modify Firefox to support DeCert (i.e., proper validation) as a proof-of-concept, and test it to demonstrate the feasibility, compatibility of DeCerts with browsers and TLS/HTTPS protocols. DeCerts enhance the security, scalability, and manageability of CDN delegation, offering a practical solution for Internet services.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09983","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.606362","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csni","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Ethan Thompson, Ali Sadeghi Jahromi, AbdelRahman Abdou","raw_content_length":1651,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Certificate Authorities","CDN","Content Delivery Networks","Delegated Credentials","DeCerts","Delegation Certificates"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1650,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251009983v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The use","Content Delivery Networks","CDNs","the past decade","approximately 55 million websites","CDN services","Emerging solutions","Delegated Credentials"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251009983v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The use":1.0,"Content Delivery Networks":1.0,"CDNs":1.0,"the past decade":1.0,"approximately 55 million websites":1.0,"CDN services":1.0,"Emerging solutions":1.0,"Delegated Credentials":1.0}},"age_hours":2.747213025277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9308,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0366,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0037,"anger":0.0107,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new method for CDN delegation (DeCerts) that could potentially improve network efficiency and security.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_041e0c4828d2","title":"Learning Joint Embeddings of Function and Process Call Graphs for Malware Detection","content":"arXiv:2510.09984v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation. While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318 malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09984","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.606817","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Kartikeya Aneja, Nagender Aneja, Murat Kantarcioglu","raw_content_length":1810,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Software"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1809,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Joint Embeddings","Function","Process","Graphs","Malware Detection","graphs","functions","arXiv251009984v1","Announce Type","new Abstract"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Process"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Joint Embeddings":2.0,"Function":2.0,"Process":2.0,"Graphs":2.0,"Malware Detection":2.0,"graphs":2.0,"functions":2.0,"arXiv251009984v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0}},"age_hours":2.747228001111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9083,"joy":0.0107,"surprise":0.0478,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0082,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to malware detection using joint embeddings of function and process call graphs.

However, using personal information in machine learning applications has sparked significant security and privacy concerns about user data. To address these challenges, different privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) frameworks have been developed to protect sensitive information in machine learning applications. These frameworks generally attempt to balance design trade-offs such as computational efficiency, communication overhead, security guarantees, and scalability. Despite the advancements, selecting the optimal framework and parameters for specific deployment scenarios remains a complex and critical challenge for privacy and security application developers. We present Prismo, an open-source recommendation system designed to aid in selecting optimal parameters and frameworks for different PPML application scenarios. Prismo enables users to explore a comprehensive space of PPML frameworks through various properties based on user-defined objectives. It supports automated filtering of suitable candidate frameworks by considering parameters such as the number of parties in multi-party computation or federated learning and computation cost constraints in homomorphic encryption. Prismo models every use case into a Linear Integer Programming optimization problem, ensuring tailored solutions are recommended for each scenario. We evaluate Prismo's effectiveness through multiple use cases, demonstrating its ability to deliver best-fit solutions in different deployment scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09985","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.607229","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Nges Brian Njungle, Eric Jahns, Luigi Mastromauro, Edwin P.

This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers: \\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve hard problems, and \\textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the \\emph{Search Mechanism}, \\emph{Reward Formulation}, and \\emph{Transition Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \\textbf{Search Guidance} for TTS and durable \\textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09988","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.607640","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Jiaqi Wei, Xiang Zhang, Yuejin Yang, Wenxuan Huang, Juntai Cao, Sheng Xu, Xiang Zhuang, Zhangyang Gao, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Laks V.
