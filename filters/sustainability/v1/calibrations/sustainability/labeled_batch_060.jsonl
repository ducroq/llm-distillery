Vier lijsttrekkers gaan met elkaar in debat. Waarschijnlijk zonder PVV-leider Geert Wilders. En het Nederlands elftal speelt de WK-kwalificatiewedstrijd tegen Finland. Het is vandaag zwaar bewolkt en er kan er lokaal wat regen vallen. Het wordt ongeveer 16 graden bij een zwakke tot matige wind. Ga je op pad? Hier vind je het overzicht van wegwerkzaamheden en hier lees je waar werkzaamheden en storingen zijn op het spoor. Wat kun je vandaag verwachten? Wat heb je gemist? Meer dan twintig wereldleiders zullen morgen in Egypte samenkomen voor een top over Gaza. De Egyptische president Sisi en de Amerikaanse president Trump zullen de top voorzitten. Inmiddels hebben ook de Franse president Macron, de Britse premier Starmer en secretaris-generaal van de Verenigde Naties Guterres aangekondigd af te reizen naar de Egyptische badplaats Sharm el-Sheikh voor de top. Ook de Italiaanse premier Meloni en de Spaanse premier Sanchez hebben hun aanwezigheid bevestigd. Volgens de Amerikaanse nieuwssite Axios neemt Israël niet deel aan de top. Hamas heeft ook laten weten niet betrokken te zijn. Ander nieuws uit de nacht: En dan nog even dit: 3FM viert dit weekend de zestigste verjaardag. Beeld en Geluid in Hilversum is de feestlocatie en is gratis te bezoeken. 3FM maakt daar ook vandaag live radio.
