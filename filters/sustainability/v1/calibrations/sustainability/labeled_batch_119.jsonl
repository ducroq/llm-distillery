This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images. Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942, precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives. Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11232","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.906955","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Neilansh Chauhan, Piyush Kumar Gupta, Faraz Doja","raw_content_length":1594,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1593,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LightPneumoNet Lightweight Pneumonia Classifier","Announce Type","Effective pneumonia diagnosis","the difficulty","large computationally expensive deep learning models","resource-limited settings","This study","an efficient lightweight convolutional neural network","CNN","scratch"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large computationally expensive deep learning models"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LightPneumoNet Lightweight Pneumonia Classifier":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Effective pneumonia diagnosis":1.0,"the difficulty":1.0,"large computationally expensive deep learning models":1.0,"resource-limited settings":1.0,"This study":1.0,"an efficient lightweight convolutional neural network":1.0,"CNN":1.0,"scratch":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7574786113888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8357,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.0754,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0401,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a lightweight pneumonia classifier (LightPneumoNet) with a small memory footprint (1.48 MB) and high accuracy (0.942) on a test dataset.

However, as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual, trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly, and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions rather than na\\\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1) column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly on par with FP16 models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11234","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.907741","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Jegwang Ryu, Minkyu Kim, Seungjun Shin, Hee Min Choi, Dokwan Oh, Jaeho Lee","raw_content_length":1437,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MSE","NWC","Neural Weight Compression"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1436,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Neural Weight Compression","Language Models","language model weights","arXiv251011234v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The efficient storage","transmission","their scale","adoption","our understanding"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Neural Weight Compression":2.0,"Language Models":2.0,"language model weights":2.0,"arXiv251011234v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The efficient storage":1.0,"transmission":1.0,"their scale":1.0,"adoption":1.0,"our understanding":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7575073394444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9226,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.0217,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0154,"anger":0.0136,"disgust":0.0113},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel neural weight compression technique (NWC) for language models, aiming to reduce storage and transmission costs.

However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.908168","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Leonard Dung, Florian Mai","raw_content_length":1180,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AI Alignment Strategies"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1179,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["which","AI Alignment Strategies","a Risk Perspective","Independent Safety Mechanisms","Shared Failures","safety","Announce Type","new Abstract","AI alignment research","techniques"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AI Alignment Strategies"],"research_academic":["AI alignment research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"which":3.0,"AI Alignment Strategies":2.0,"a Risk Perspective":2.0,"Independent Safety Mechanisms":2.0,"Shared Failures":2.0,"safety":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"AI alignment research":1.0,"techniques":1.0}},"age_hours":2.757523337222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.0295,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6059,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.829,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0112,"sadness":0.0297,"fear":0.0871,"anger":0.0235,"disgust":0.0159},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes AI alignment techniques and their failure modes, which is a theoretical exercise.

A powerful framework in this context is the use of iteratively reweighted schemes, which are based on constructing a sequence of quadratic tangent majorants of the $\\ell_2$-$\\ell_1$ regularization functional (with additional smoothing to ensure differentiability at the origin), and solving them successively. Recently, flexible Krylov-Tikhonov methods have been used to partially solve each problem in the sequence efficiently. However, in order to guarantee convergence, the complexity of the algorithm at each iteration increases with respect to more traditional methods. We propose a randomized flexible Krylov method to alleviate the increase of complexity, which leverages the adaptability of the flexible Krylov subspaces with the efficiency of `sketch-and-solve' methods. A possible caveat of the mentioned methods is their memory requirements. In this case, one needs to rely instead on inner-outer schemes. In these scenarios, we propose a `sketch-to-precondition' method to speed up the convergence of each of the subproblems in the sequence. The performance of these algorithms is shown through a variety of numerical examples.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11237","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.908960","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Malena Sabat\\'e Landman, Yuji Nakatsukasa","raw_content_length":1316,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":["Krylov-Tikhonov","Krylov"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\ell_2$-$\\ell_1$"]},"char_count":1315,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Randomized flexible Krylov methods","ell_p regularization","Announce Type","new Abstract","The computation","sparse solutions","large-scale linear","discrete ill-posed problems","a computationally demanding task","A powerful framework"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Randomized flexible Krylov methods":2.0,"ell_p regularization":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The computation":1.0,"sparse solutions":1.0,"large-scale linear":1.0,"discrete ill-posed problems":1.0,"a computationally demanding task":1.0,"A powerful framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7575528583333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8815,"joy":0.0211,"surprise":0.0543,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0089,"anger":0.0206,"disgust":0.009},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a randomized flexible Krylov method to improve the computational efficiency of solving large-scale linear discrete ill-posed problems, which could potentially reduce energy consumption in scientific computing.

However, existing research has focused exclusively on single-agent backdoor attacks, overlooking the novel attack surfaces introduced by agent collaboration in MAS. To bridge this gap, we present the first Distributed Backdoor Attack tailored to MAS. We decompose the backdoor into multiple distributed attack primitives that are embedded within MAS tools. These primitives remain dormant individually but collectively activate only when agents collaborate in a specific sequence, thereby assembling the full backdoor to execute targeted attacks such as data exfiltration. To fully assess this threat, we introduce a benchmark for multi-role collaborative tasks and a sandboxed framework to evaluate. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack achieves an attack success rate exceeding 95% without degrading performance on benign tasks.

Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines.

In all such cases, the competitive nature of their engagements gives rise to a game where the firms need to decide how to distribute their budget over the agents on a network to maximize their brand's awareness. The firms (players) therefore need to optimize how much budget they should put on the vertices of the network so that the spread improves via direct (via advertisements or free promotional offers) and indirect marketing (words-of-mouth). We propose a two-timescale model of decisions where the communication between the vertices happen in a faster timescale and the strategy update of the firms happen in a slower timescale. We show that under fairly standard conditions, the best response dynamics of the firms converge to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. However, such equilibria can be away from a socially optimal one. We provide a characterization of the contest success functions and provide examples for the designers of such contests (e.g., regulators, social network providers, etc.) such that the Nash equilibrium becomes unique and social welfare maximizing. Our experiments show that for realistic scenarios, such contest success functions perform fairly well.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11253","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.911711","language":"en","tags":["research","csgt","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":216,"author":"Sayantika Mandal, Harman Agrawal, Swaprava Nath","raw_content_length":1438,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.08,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Budgets"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1437,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Likes","Budgets","Equilibria","Designing Contests","Socially Optimal Advertising","the firms","arXiv251011253v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Firms","businesses"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Likes":2.0,"Budgets":2.0,"Equilibria":2.0,"Designing Contests":2.0,"Socially Optimal Advertising":2.0,"the firms":2.0,"arXiv251011253v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Firms":1.0,"businesses":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7576597172222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.662500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9325,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8592,"joy":0.0271,"surprise":0.0192,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0168,"anger":0.0497,"disgust":0.0244},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a model for optimizing advertising spend on social networks to maximize brand awareness.

Evaluation of Tests on Sexism, Racism, and Morality","content":"arXiv:2510.11254v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks, indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11254","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.912087","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Jana Jung, Marlene Lutz, Indira Sen, Markus Strohmaier","raw_content_length":1156,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1155,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Psychometric Tests","Large Language Models","Evaluation","Tests","Sexism","Racism","Morality","LLMs","arXiv251011254v1","new Abstract"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Psychometric Tests":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"Evaluation":2.0,"Tests":2.0,"Sexism":2.0,"Racism":2.0,"Morality":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv251011254v1":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0}},"age_hours":2.757675656388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.0705,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5859,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8416,"joy":0.016,"surprise":0.045,"sadness":0.009,"fear":0.0179,"anger":0.0376,"disgust":0.0328},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper investigates the reliability and validity of psychometric tests on LLMs for assessing biases like sexism and racism.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_79e55bb5b8ae","title":"Temporal Cooperative Games","content":"arXiv:2510.11255v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Classical cooperative game theory assumes that the worth of a coalition depends only on the set of agents involved, but in practice, it may also depend on the order in which agents arrive. Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce temporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the sequence of agents $\\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for rethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is the incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in the order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional properties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents to invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the total worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify a class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three properties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we construct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where rewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world, where rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency, additivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both worlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms satisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted classes such as convex and simple TCGs. Our findings thus uncover a fundamental tension: when players arrive sequentially, reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying desirable temporal properties must inherently differ from Shapley-inspired ones, opening new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts in TCGs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11255","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.912514","language":"en","tags":["research","csgt","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":266,"author":"Ashwin Goyal, Drashthi Doshi, Swaprava Nath","raw_content_length":1819,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.33,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OIR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["S$."]},"char_count":1818,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["agents","Temporal Cooperative Games","arXiv251011255v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Classical cooperative game theory","the worth","a coalition","the set","practice","the order"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"agents":3.0,"Temporal Cooperative Games":2.0,"arXiv251011255v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Classical cooperative game theory":1.0,"the worth":1.0,"a coalition":1.0,"the set":1.0,"practice":1.0,"the order":1.0}},"age_hours":2.757691161111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8917,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.0156,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0296,"anger":0.0272,"disgust":0.023},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for temporal cooperative games, focusing on reward-sharing mechanisms.

Although recent studies have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot. The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and the data efficiency of our approach.

Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11260","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.914929","language":"en","tags":["csai","preprints","cscv","research","physicsdata-an","computer-science","cond-matmtrl-sci","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":279,"author":"Yuxuan Chen, Ruotong Yang, Zhengyang Zhang, Mehreen Ahmed, Yanming Wang","raw_content_length":1932,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.395,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DenseNet","OCR","Convolutional Recurrent"],"persons":["a Large Language Model"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1931,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251011260v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Microscopic characterizations","Scanning Electron Microscopy","SEM","scientific research","microstructures","the scale bars","an important first step","accurate SEM analysis"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["scientific research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251011260v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Microscopic characterizations":1.0,"Scanning Electron Microscopy":1.0,"SEM":1.0,"scientific research":1.0,"microstructures":1.0,"the scale bars":1.0,"an important first step":1.0,"accurate SEM analysis":1.0}},"age_hours":2.75774893,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9168,"joy":0.0082,"surprise":0.0272,"sadness":0.018,"fear":0.0142,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel framework for automated scale bar detection in SEM images using LLMs. While it improves efficiency and accuracy in microscopic analysis, its direct climate impact is minimal.

In such problems, our objective is to maximize a monotone reward function $f(\\mathbf{x})$ over the allocation vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_{ij})_{i, j}$, which describes the amount of each item given to each agent. In settings where $f$ is concave and has \"diminishing returns\" (monotone decreasing gradient), several lines of work over the past two decades have had great success designing constant-competitive algorithms, including the foundational work of Mehta et al. (2005) on the Adwords problem and many follow-ups. Notably, while a greedy algorithm is $\\frac{1}{2}$-competitive in such settings, these works have shown that one can often obtain a competitive ratio of $1-\\frac{1}{e} \\approx 0.632$ in a variety of settings when items are divisible (i.e. allowing fractional allocations). However, prior works have thus far used a variety of problem-specific techniques, leaving open the general question: Does a $(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-competitive fractional algorithm always exist for online resource allocation problems with concave, diminishing-returns objectives? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively, thereby unifying and generalizing prior results for special cases. Our algorithm is one which makes continuous greedy allocations with respect to an auxiliary objective $U(\\mathbf{x})$. Using the online primal-dual method, we show that if $U$ satisfies a \"balanced\" property with respect to $f$, then one can bound the competitiveness of such an algorithm. Our crucial observation is that there is a simple expression for $U$ which has this balanced property for any $f$, yielding our general $(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-competitive algorithm.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11266","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.915754","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":271,"author":"Kalen Patton","raw_content_length":1911,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.355,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["x_{ij})_{i","Adwords"],"persons":["Mehta"],"locations":["\\approx"],"monetary":["1-\\frac{1}{e"]},"char_count":1908,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Online Allocation","Concave","which","arXiv251011266v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Online resource allocation problems","central challenges","economics","computer science","modeling situations"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["computer science"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Online Allocation":2.0,"Concave":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251011266v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Online resource allocation problems":1.0,"central challenges":1.0,"economics":1.0,"computer science":1.0,"modeling situations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7577787075,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8544,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.0208,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0483,"anger":0.0418,"disgust":0.0173},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for online resource allocation, which could potentially improve the efficiency of resource allocation in various sectors.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_71238f152f38","title":"Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing","content":"arXiv:2510.11268v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and adversarial trigger optimization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11268","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.916153","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Jaeik Kim, Jaeyoung Do","raw_content_length":1444,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1443,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Class Vectors","Classifier Editing","arXiv251011268v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Image classifiers","a critical role","diseases","medical imaging","anomalies","manufacturing processes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Class Vectors":2.0,"Classifier Editing":2.0,"arXiv251011268v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Image classifiers":1.0,"a critical role":1.0,"diseases":1.0,"medical imaging":1.0,"anomalies":1.0,"manufacturing processes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.757792761388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9381,"joy":0.0022,"surprise":0.0103,"sadness":0.0146,"fear":0.0183,"anger":0.0067,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for editing image classifiers, which could potentially improve the accuracy of anomaly detection in manufacturing and disease detection in medical imaging.

This study presents an in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end, we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication (SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring and management. We publicly release the datasets to support reproducibility and foster extensions to other use cases.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11269","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.916604","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csni","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Antonio Montieri, Alfredo Nascita, Antonio Pescap\\`e","raw_content_length":1939,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Network","Gemini arXiv:2510.11269v1 Announce Type","GenAI","Copilot","Android"],"persons":["Gemini"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1938,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ChatGPT","Copilot","Gemini","Prompts","Packets","the Network","arXiv251011269v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Generative AI GenAI chatbots","digital ecosystems"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["ChatGPT"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ChatGPT":3.0,"Copilot":3.0,"Gemini":3.0,"Prompts":2.0,"Packets":2.0,"the Network":2.0,"arXiv251011269v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Generative AI GenAI chatbots":1.0,"digital ecosystems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7578087666666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8875,"joy":0.0104,"surprise":0.0299,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.027,"anger":0.023,"disgust":0.0169},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes network traffic of GenAI chatbots, identifying app- and content-specific traffic patterns.

The Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However, in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix, which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously, by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data scenarios.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c6404903b3a9","title":"Towards Real","content":"arXiv:2510.11277v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios, where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1) Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2) Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy. Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves generalization to real-time news.

Free-form instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fabf26082155","title":"Vision","content":"arXiv:2510.11282v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges, we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process.

We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS (Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy, latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_60c2dedba27d","title":"LouisKV: Efficient KV Cache Retrieval for Long Input","content":"arXiv:2510.11292v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU. However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important. To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output. Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically, LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled, fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs. Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to 4.7$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks, including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input long-output scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11292","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.922606","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Wenbo Wu, Qingyi Si, Xiurui Pan, Ye Wang, Jie Zhang","raw_content_length":1969,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Key-Value","GPU"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1968,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LouisKV Efficient KV Cache Retrieval","Long Input","Announce Type","new Abstract","Key-Value KV cache","redundant computations","auto-regressive models","significant memory","its practical deployment","long-sequence scenarios"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LouisKV Efficient KV Cache Retrieval":2.0,"Long Input":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Key-Value KV cache":1.0,"redundant computations":1.0,"auto-regressive models":1.0,"significant memory":1.0,"its practical deployment":1.0,"long-sequence scenarios":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7579971380555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9075,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0142,"sadness":0.0309,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0198},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new method (LouisKV) for efficient KV cache retrieval in auto-regressive models, leading to reduced memory overhead and faster processing.

Crucially, real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\\% of data). Our approach substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with less training data.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0d78443b2705","title":"$\\Delta \\mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision","content":"arXiv:2510.11296v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM).

Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection.

However, constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges for future work. To advance research in this area, we also release a curated dataset of LLM-generated KGs derived from research papers on children's mental well-being. This resource aims to foster more transparent, reliable, and impactful applications in high-stakes domains such as healthcare.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11297","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.924164","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Ruirui Chen, Weifeng Jiang, Chengwei Qin, Bo Xiong, Fiona Liausvia, Dongkyu Choi, Boon Kiat Quek","raw_content_length":1270,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1269,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Large Language Models","Effective Knowledge Graph Constructors","arXiv251011297v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Knowledge graphs","KGs","knowledge-intensive tasks","promise","hallucinations","large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Large Language Models":2.0,"Effective Knowledge Graph Constructors":2.0,"arXiv251011297v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Knowledge graphs":1.0,"KGs":1.0,"knowledge-intensive tasks":1.0,"promise":1.0,"hallucinations":1.0,"large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758055722222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9069,"joy":0.0127,"surprise":0.041,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0154,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a framework for constructing knowledge graphs using LLMs. While it mentions evaluating the graphs from structural and semantic perspectives, there are no concrete actions or measurable outcomes related to climate impact.

We examine how well this promise is kept by the main privacy models. We find they may fail to provide adequate protection guarantees because of problems in their definition or incur unacceptable trade-offs between privacy protection and utility preservation. Specifically, k-anonymity may not entirely exclude disclosure if enforced with deterministic mechanisms or without constraints on the confidential values. On the other hand, differential privacy (DP) incurs unacceptable utility loss for small budgets and its privacy guarantee becomes meaningless for large budgets. In the latter case, an ex post empirical assessment of disclosure risk becomes necessary, undermining the main appeal of privacy models. Whereas the utility preservation of DP can only be improved by relaxing its privacy guarantees, we argue that a semantic reformulation of k-anonymity can offer more robust privacy without losing utility with respect to traditional syntactic k-anonymity.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11299","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.927898","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","csdb","cscr","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":170,"author":"Josep Domingo-Ferrer, David S\\'anchez","raw_content_length":1203,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.85,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1202,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Actual Privacy","Utility","Privacy Models","the k","arXiv251011299v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Privacy models","privacy-preserving data publishing","statistical disclosure control","the promise"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Actual Privacy":2.0,"Utility":2.0,"Privacy Models":2.0,"the k":2.0,"arXiv251011299v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Privacy models":1.0,"privacy-preserving data publishing":1.0,"statistical disclosure control":1.0,"the promise":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7580702322222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.088,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5824,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.741,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0163,"sadness":0.1084,"fear":0.0434,"anger":0.0484,"disgust":0.0367},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the limitations of privacy models like k-anonymity and differential privacy.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0465f9a80595","title":"Beyond touch","content":"arXiv:2510.11300v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper proposes an agent-based approach toward a more natural interface between humans and machines. Large language models equipped with tools and the communication standard OPC UA are utilized to control machines in natural language. Instead of touch interaction, which is currently the state-of-the-art medium for interaction in operations, the proposed approach enables operators to talk or text with machines. This allows commands such as 'Please decrease the temperature by 20 % in machine 1 and set the motor speed to 5000 rpm in machine 2.' The large language model receives the user input and selects one of three predefined tools that connect to an OPC UA server and either change or read the value of a node. Afterwards, the result of the tool execution is passed back to the language model, which then provides a final response to the user. The approach is universally designed and can therefore be applied to any machine that supports the OPC UA standard. The large language model is neither fine-tuned nor requires training data, only the relevant machine credentials and a parameter dictionary are included within the system prompt. The approach is evaluated on a Siemens S7-1500 programmable logic controller with four machine parameters in a case study of fifty synthetically generated commands on five different models. The results demonstrate high success rate, with proprietary GPT 5 models achieving accuracies between 96.0 % and 98.0 %, and open-weight models reaching up to 90.0 %. The proposed approach of this empirical study contributes to advancing natural interaction in industrial human-machine interfaces.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11300","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.928368","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Bernd Hofmann, Sven Kreitlein, Joerg Franke, Patrick Bruendl","raw_content_length":1687,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1686,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["machines","touch","arXiv251011300v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","an agent-based approach","a more natural interface","humans","Large language models","tools"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"machines":3.0,"touch":2.0,"arXiv251011300v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"an agent-based approach":1.0,"a more natural interface":1.0,"humans":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"tools":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758085675277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.239,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6478,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8963,"joy":0.0298,"surprise":0.0559,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0031,"anger":0.0061,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach to human-machine interfaces using LLMs, potentially reducing energy consumption by optimizing machine parameters.

The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision","content":"arXiv:2510.11302v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for 100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond 55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year. Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories (ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11302","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.929244","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Samer Al-Hamadani","raw_content_length":1945,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["YOLO","Gemini Flash","VLM","The Hidden Economics of Object Detection","Vision-Language Models","Total Cost of Ownership"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1944,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Training Pay","Object","the Era","Vision","Announce Type","new Abstract","Object detection systems","supervised learning","manually annotated bounding boxes","high accuracy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Training Pay","Vision"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Training Pay":2.0,"Object":2.0,"the Era":2.0,"Vision":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Object detection systems":1.0,"supervised learning":1.0,"manually annotated bounding boxes":1.0,"high accuracy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758114873888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8665,"joy":0.0314,"surprise":0.0648,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.009,"anger":0.0161,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of two object detection methods, comparing supervised learning (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini).

This study uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River (France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers. Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step and the hyperparameters of the methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.930073","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","physicsgeo-ph","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Jean-Paul Travert, C\\'edric Goeury, S\\'ebastien Boyaval, Vito Bacchi, Fabrice Zaoui","raw_content_length":1786,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Synthetic Aperture Radar","SAR arXiv:2510.11305v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":["the Garonne River","France"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1785,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SAR","the effects","preprocessing","method selection","arXiv251011305v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Flood mapping and water depth estimation","calibrating and validating hydraulic models","This study","SAR imagery"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SAR":3.0,"the effects":2.0,"preprocessing":2.0,"method selection":2.0,"arXiv251011305v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Flood mapping and water depth estimation":1.0,"calibrating and validating hydraulic models":1.0,"This study":1.0,"SAR imagery":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7581445516666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.871,"joy":0.0134,"surprise":0.039,"sadness":0.0107,"fear":0.0316,"anger":0.0218,"disgust":0.0124},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study evaluates different methods for flood mapping and water depth estimation using SAR imagery.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_5ec591f0559e","title":"Rotor","content":"arXiv:2510.11306v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis (FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to ensure fast failure detection and flight stability.

Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.

However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11307","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.930891","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Sabrina McCallum, Amit Parekh, Alessandro Suglia","raw_content_length":1465,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Transformer"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1464,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FOSSIL","Feedback","Suboptimal Samples","Data-Efficient Generalisation","Imitation Learning","Embodied Vision","arXiv251011307v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Current approaches","embodied AI"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["embodied AI"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FOSSIL":2.0,"Feedback":2.0,"Suboptimal Samples":2.0,"Data-Efficient Generalisation":2.0,"Imitation Learning":2.0,"Embodied Vision":2.0,"arXiv251011307v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Current approaches":1.0,"embodied AI":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7581742508333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8199,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0104,"sadness":0.0245,"fear":0.0707,"anger":0.0456,"disgust":0.0232},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel approach to training embodied AI agents using language feedback, which could potentially improve data efficiency and generalization.

However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments. Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in real-world scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11308","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.931275","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Weixi Situ, Hanjing Ye, Jianwei Peng, Yu Zhan, Hong Zhang","raw_content_length":1326,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RPF"],"persons":["Adap arXiv:2510.11308v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1325,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adap","arXiv251011308v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Robot person","RPF","a core capability","human-robot interaction","robots","users","daily activities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["daily activities"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adap":2.0,"arXiv251011308v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Robot person":1.0,"RPF":1.0,"a core capability":1.0,"human-robot interaction":1.0,"robots":1.0,"users":1.0,"daily activities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7581886869444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.539,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9383,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.0251,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0109,"anger":0.0094,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for robot person following (RPF) but does not provide concrete evidence of GHG emission reductions or other direct environmental benefits.

This paper presents a structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates, i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts. Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective.

Currently, satisfying complex requirements in cyber-physical systems requires significant manual effort and domain expertise to develop the underlying reachability programs. This high development effort limits the broader adoption of reachability analysis for complex verification problems. To address this, pyspect provides a method-agnostic approach to performing reachability analysis for verifying a temporal logic specification via temporal logic trees (TLTs). It enables the specification of complex safety and liveness requirements using high-level logic formulations that are independent of any particular reachability technique or set representation. As a result, pyspect allows for the comparison of different reachability implementations, such as Hamilton-Jacobi and Hybrid Zonotope-based reachability analysis, for the same temporal logic specification. This design separates the concerns of implementation developers (who develop numerical procedures for reachability) and end-users (who write specifications). Through a simple vehicle example, we demonstrate how pyspect simplifies the synthesis of reachability programs, promotes specification reusability, and facilitates side-by-side comparisons of reachability techniques for complex tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11316","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.936728","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Kaj Munhoz Arfvidsson, Loizos Hadjiloizou, Frank J.

Existing generative paradigms attempt to address this but suffer from critical limitations: Large Language Model (LLM) based methods create a semantic mismatch by forcing e-commerce signals into a linguistic space, while ID-based generation is constrained by item memorization and cold-start issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel generative pre-training paradigm. Our model learns to predict the Next Interest Flow, a dense vector sequence representing a user's future intent, while simultaneously modeling its internal Interest Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity to ensure the representation is both rich and coherent. However, this two-stage approach introduces a critical objective mismatch between the generative and discriminative stages. We resolve this via a bidirectional alignment strategy, which harmonizes the two stages through cross-stage weight initialization and a dynamic Semantic Alignment Module for fine-tuning. Additionally, we enhance the underlying discriminative model with a Temporal Sequential Pairwise (TSP) mechanism to better capture temporal causality. We present the All-domain Moveline Evolution Network (AMEN), a unified framework implementing our entire pipeline. Extensive offline experiments validate AMEN's superiority over strong baselines, and a large-scale online A/B test demonstrates its significant real-world impact, delivering substantial improvements in key business metrics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11317","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.937262","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Chen Gao, Zixin Zhao, Lv Shao, Tong Liu","raw_content_length":1701,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CTR","Interest Diversity and Interest Evolution Velocity","the Next Interest Flow"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1700,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Next Interest Flow","A Generative Pre","arXiv251011317v1 Announce Type","new Abstract Click-Through Rate CTR prediction","a cornerstone","modern recommender systems","discriminative models","past user behavior","proactively modeling user intent","critical limitations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Next Interest Flow":2.0,"A Generative Pre":2.0,"arXiv251011317v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract Click-Through Rate CTR prediction":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0,"modern recommender systems":1.0,"discriminative models":1.0,"past user behavior":1.0,"proactively modeling user intent":1.0,"critical limitations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7582648063888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.9064999999999999,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6187,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7951,"joy":0.0033,"surprise":0.0178,"sadness":0.0176,"fear":0.0641,"anger":0.037,"disgust":0.0651},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel generative pre-training paradigm for recommender systems.

Our framework provides a generic denotational reduction -- namely, a denotational product construction -- from linear-time safety verification of effectful higher-order programs to computation of weakest pre-conditions of product programs. This reduction enables us to apply existing algorithms for such well-studied computations of weakest pre-conditions, some of which are available as off-the-shelf solvers.

We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales. Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite receiving no semantic supervision.

It not only increases product exposure but also allows promoters to earn a commission. This paper addresses the pivotal yet under-explored challenge in affiliate marketing: accurately assessing and predicting the contributions of promoters in product promotion. We design a novel metric for evaluating the indirect contributions of the promoter, called propagation scale. Unfortunately, existing time series forecasting techniques fail to deliver accurate predictions due to the propagation scale being influenced by multiple factors and the inherent complexities arising from dynamic scenarios. To address this issue, we decouple the network structure from the node signals and propose a two-stage solution: initially, the basic self-sales and network structure prediction are conducted separately, followed by the synthesis of the propagation scale. Specifically, we design a graph convolution encoding scheme based on descendant neighbors and incorporate hypergraph convolution to efficiently capture complex promotional dynamics. Additionally, three auxiliary tasks are employed: self-sales prediction for base estimations, descendant prediction to synthesize propagation scale, and promoter activation prediction to mitigate high volatility issues. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets validate the superiority of our method.

This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65% emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11328","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.938955","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Chenxi Wang, Yixuan Zhang, Ruiji Yu, Yufei Zheng, Lang Gao, Zirui Song, Zixiang Xu, Gus Xia, Huishuai Zhang, Dongyan Zhao, Xiuying Chen","raw_content_length":1520,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SEV"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1519,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","Emotion Circuits Discovery","Control","emotional expression","arXiv251011328v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the demand","emotional intelligence","large language models","a key challenge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","large language models"],"research_academic":["Emotion Circuits Discovery"],"engineering":["Control"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":4.0,"Emotion Circuits Discovery":2.0,"Control":2.0,"emotional expression":2.0,"arXiv251011328v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the demand":1.0,"emotional intelligence":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"a key challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7583215063888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.664999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.533,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8955,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0574,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0133,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0093},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into understanding and controlling emotions in LLMs. While potentially impactful for AI safety and alignment, it has no direct or immediate impact on climate change or other sustainability dimensions.

We present Diffusion-Link, a diffusion-based modality-bridging module that generatively maps audio embeddings into the text-embedding distribution. The module is trained at the output embedding from the frozen multimodal encoder and implemented as a lightweight network with three residual MLP blocks. To assess the effect of Diffusion-Link on multimodal encoder-LLM coupling, we evaluate on Automatic Audio Captioning (AAC); to our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion-based modality bridging to AAC. We report two results. (1) Modality-gap analysis: on similarity and geometric criteria, Diffusion-Link reduces the modality gap the most among prior diffusion-based methods and shows a collective migration of audio embeddings toward the text distribution. (2) Downstream AAC: attaching Diffusion-Link to the same multimodal LLM baseline achieves state-of-the-art on AudioCaps in both zero-shot and fully supervised captioning without external knowledge, with relative gains up to 52.5% and 7.5%, respectively. These findings show that closing the modality gap is pivotal for effective coupling between multimodal encoders and LLMs, and diffusion-based modality bridging offers a promising direction beyond knowledge-retrieval-centric designs.

Existing edge-based LLM inference systems typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding (SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services. Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems. In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency reduction compared to benchmark schemes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11331","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.939828","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Bingjie Zhu, Zhixiong Chen, Liqiang Zhao, Hyundong Shin, Arumugam Nallanathan","raw_content_length":1883,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Efficient LLM Inference","Heterogeneous Edge Networks","LLM"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1882,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Efficient LLM Inference","Heterogeneous Edge Networks","Speculative Decoding","arXiv251011331v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language model LLM inference","the network edge","a promising serving paradigm","leverages","edge resources"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Efficient LLM Inference","Large language model LLM inference"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Efficient LLM Inference":2.0,"Heterogeneous Edge Networks":2.0,"Speculative Decoding":2.0,"arXiv251011331v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language model LLM inference":1.0,"the network edge":1.0,"a promising serving paradigm":1.0,"leverages":1.0,"edge resources":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758352251388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.453999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6908,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9454,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.0199,"sadness":0.0031,"fear":0.0057,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0095},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a speculative decoding framework for LLM inference at the edge, aiming to reduce serving latency.

However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their ability to leverage historical events knowledge.

In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11341","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.941394","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Haomin Wang, Jinhui Yin, Qi Wei, Wenguang Zeng, Lixin Gu, Shenglong Ye, Zhangwei Gao, Yaohui Wang, Yanting Zhang, Yuanqi Li, Yanwen Guo, Wenhai Wang, Kai Chen, Yu Qiao, Hongjie Zhang","raw_content_length":1634,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SArena","SVG"],"persons":["InternSVG"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1633,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["InternSVG","Unified SVG Tasks","Multimodal Large Language Models","arXiv251011341v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","General SVG modeling","fragmented datasets","limited transferability","methods","tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"InternSVG":2.0,"Unified SVG Tasks":2.0,"Multimodal Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251011341v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"General SVG modeling":1.0,"fragmented datasets":1.0,"limited transferability":1.0,"methods":1.0,"tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7584135975,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.5015,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7003,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9045,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0334,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.0208,"anger":0.0164,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) for SVG understanding, editing, and generation.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_4fc0531318dd","title":"TBRD: TESLA Authenticated UAS Broadcast Remote ID","content":"arXiv:2510.11343v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Mysterious sightings of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) over U.S. military facilities, suburban neighborhoods, and commercial airports have intensified scrutiny of drone activity. To increase accountability, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) introduced a Remote ID mandate, requiring unmanned aircraft to broadcast their location, operator's location, and identity in real-time. However, current standards leave authentication mechanisms underspecified, enabling spoofing, relay, and replay attacks that can undermine surveillance efforts and potentially disrupt UAS-to-UAS coordination in future deployments. In this paper, we propose TBRD, a practical system for authenticating Remote ID messages in a manner that aligns with existing standards and UAS capabilities. TBRD leverages the TESLA protocol and mobile device TEEs, and introduces a verification mechanism to build a lightweight, mission-scoped authentication system that is both computationally efficient and requires a low communication footprint. We evaluate the performance of TBRD using both an FAA-requirements compatible proof-of-concept implementation for performance metrics and a simulated 4-drone swarm mission scenario to demonstrate its security guarantees under adversarial conditions. Our system provides a 50\\% reduction in authentication overhead compared to digital signatures and a 100x reduction in computation time. Our results demonstrate that TBRD can be integrated into current Remote ID infrastructures to provide a scalable, standards-compliant message authentication for both regulatory and operational use cases.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11343","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.945649","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Jason Veara, Manav Jain, Kyle Moy, Aanjhan Ranganathan","raw_content_length":1658,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FAA","UAS","Unmanned Aircraft Systems","the Federal Aviation Administration","TBRD"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["U.S."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1657,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["TBRD","TESLA","UAS Broadcast Remote ID","arXiv251011343v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Mysterious sightings","Unmanned Aircraft Systems","UAS","US military facilities","suburban neighborhoods"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Unmanned Aircraft Systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"TBRD":2.0,"TESLA":2.0,"UAS Broadcast Remote ID":2.0,"arXiv251011343v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Mysterious sightings":1.0,"Unmanned Aircraft Systems":1.0,"UAS":1.0,"US military facilities":1.0,"suburban neighborhoods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7584287877777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6335,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.1126,"sadness":0.0122,"fear":0.2035,"anger":0.0236,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a system for authenticating Remote ID messages for UAS, aiming to improve security and accountability.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8d17a230c289","title":"MMAP: A Multi","content":"arXiv:2510.11344v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11344","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.946115","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Hai Dang Nguyen, Nguyen Dang Huy Pham, The Minh Duc Nguyen, Dac Thai Nguyen, Hang Thi Nguyen, Duong M.
