The acquisition of documents via mobile devices is often compromised by shadow interference and geometric distortions, which degrade image quality and adversely affect both OCR accuracy and readability. To address this, we propose a novel method that utilizes control points and illumination prediction to effectively rectify distortions and eliminate shadows in captured document images. Spatial attention is employed to guide the interpolation between control points and reference points, effectively eliminating geometric distortions in the captured document images. Following geometric unwarping, an illumination correction model is applied to remove shadows and enhance surface clarity, improving both human readability and OCR accuracy. Our method demonstrates robust performance in effectively rectifying document distortions across diverse scenarios. Evaluation on the DocUNet benchmark dataset shows that our approach achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art techniques.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6304","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:58.186162","language":"en","tags":["engineering","open-access","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Ruiqi Li","raw_content_length":1156,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Control Point and Illumination Correction","OCR"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1156,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","DocCPLNet","Document Image Rectification","Control Point","Illumination Correction","mobile devices","the widespread adoption","daily life","digitizing documentation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["daily life"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"DocCPLNet":2.0,"Document Image Rectification":2.0,"Control Point":2.0,"Illumination Correction":2.0,"mobile devices":2.0,"the widespread adoption":1.0,"daily life":1.0,"digitizing documentation":1.0}},"age_hours":18.62554317027778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.4469999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5106,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.807,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0159,"sadness":0.026,"fear":0.0547,"anger":0.0466,"disgust":0.0463},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for document image rectification, which could reduce paper consumption by improving OCR accuracy and readability of digitized documents.

In most simulation studies of such systems, the diodes have been idealised as switches, an assumption that is valid only if the vibration-induced voltage is high enough, which is frequently not the case in practice. This paper presents an experimentally validated simulation of a base excited vibration energy harvester connected to a full wave rectified load, combining the analytical modal transformation of the Euler–Bernoulli model of a piezoelectric beam with the nonlinear current-voltage characteristic of a real (non-ideal) diode. Three types of diodes with significantly different model parameters sourced from industry-standard datasets are considered. Discrepancies between simulated and measured resonant voltage levels are found to be less than 10% on average, and the discrepancy in resonant frequency is less than 1%, demonstrating the reliability of the Shockley diode model despite its omission of the dynamic behaviour of the diode.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6305","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:58.186506","language":"en","tags":["engineering","open-access","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Maher Alalwan","raw_content_length":1133,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol","Bernoulli","Euler"],"locations":["AC-DC"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1123,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Experimentally Validated Modelling","a Base","Practical applications","piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting systems","a stable DC output","the nonlinear process","AC-DC rectification","most simulation studies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Experimentally Validated Modelling":2.0,"a Base":2.0,"Practical applications":1.0,"piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting systems":1.0,"a stable DC output":1.0,"the nonlinear process":1.0,"AC-DC rectification":1.0,"most simulation studies":1.0}},"age_hours":18.625560234444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2405,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8481,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9374,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0183,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0105,"disgust":0.0142},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents an experimentally validated simulation of a vibration energy harvester.

To address these limitations, a compact electromechanical–magnetic antenna (EMA) was developed and experimentally validated for ELF magnetic communication. The basic unit of the antenna, a single-EMA, consists of a stacked magnetostrictive composite beam, piezoelectric ceramic plates, and tip-mounted permanent magnets. The total envelope volume of a single EMA is only 3.3 cm3 with a maximum length of 12 cm, representing a substantial reduction compared with conventional ELF antennas. Building on this compact architecture, two EMAs were operated in parallel to form a parallel-EMA system, which significantly enhanced magnetic radiation through constructive magnetic coupling. Moreover, the optimal separation distance between the two EMAs was identified, ensuring efficient cooperative radiation. When driven at 50.2 mW, the parallel-EMA configuration generated a magnetic flux density of 114 pT at a transmission distance of 20 m in seawater. This performance demonstrates nearly a twofold improvement over a single-EMA unit, validating the scalability of parallel operation for stronger magnetic radiation. The compact form factor of the single EMA combined with the enhanced radiation performance of the parallel-EMA system enables portable ELF magnetic communication across diverse cross-medium scenarios, including air-to-sea and underground-to-air links.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6303","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:58.186852","language":"en","tags":["engineering","open-access","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Menglong Liu","raw_content_length":1564,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EMA","ELF Cross","Electromechanical","ELF"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["ELF antennas"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1544,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Magnetic Field Enhancement","an ElectromechanicalMagnetic Antenna","ELF Cross","330 Hz","cross-medium transmission","conventional implementations","their large size","low efficiency"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Magnetic Field Enhancement":2.0,"an ElectromechanicalMagnetic Antenna":2.0,"ELF Cross":2.0,"330 Hz":1.0,"cross-medium transmission":1.0,"conventional implementations":1.0,"their large size":1.0,"low efficiency":1.0}},"age_hours":18.625579195555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8999,"joy":0.0068,"surprise":0.0309,"sadness":0.0089,"fear":0.0114,"anger":0.0168,"disgust":0.0253},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents research on a compact electromechanical-magnetic antenna for ELF communication.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_d8b9d395dd05","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6302: A Multivariate Blaschke","content":"Existing multivariate signal decomposition methods insufficiently account for the mechanical characteristics of gear systems, limiting their capability in fault feature extraction. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method, Multivariate Blaschke-based Mode Decomposition (MBMD). In MBMD, multivariate vibration signals are modeled as multi-dimensional responses of the gear system. Using Stochastic Adaptive Fourier Decomposition (SAFD), these signals are represented as a unified combination of Blaschke products, enabling adaptive multi-channel information fusion. To achieve modal alignment, we introduce the concept of Blaschke multi-spectra, reformulating the decomposition problem as a spectrum segmentation task, which is solved via a joint spectral segmentation algorithm. Furthermore, a voting-based filter bank, designed according to gear fault mechanisms, is employed to suppress noise and enhance fault feature extraction. Experimental validation on gear fault signals demonstrates the effectiveness of MBMD, showing that it can efficiently integrate multivariate information and achieve more accurate fault diagnosis than existing methods, providing a new perspective for mechanical fault diagnosis.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6302","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:58.187162","language":"en","tags":["engineering","open-access","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Yu Yang","raw_content_length":1224,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Stochastic Adaptive Fourier Decomposition","MBMD","Mode Decomposition","Blaschke"],"persons":["Vol","Multivariate Blaschke"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1224,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","A Multivariate Blaschke","MBMD","Existing multivariate signal decomposition methods","the mechanical characteristics","gear systems","their capability","fault","feature extraction"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Multivariate Blaschke":2.0,"MBMD":2.0,"Existing multivariate signal decomposition methods":1.0,"the mechanical characteristics":1.0,"gear systems":1.0,"their capability":1.0,"fault":1.0,"feature extraction":1.0}},"age_hours":18.625596001111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9033,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0343,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0178,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0163},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel method for gear fault diagnosis.

Using the OpenSim public dataset (containing bilateral biomechanical data before and after long-distance running from 20 young male runners), personalized musculoskeletal models were established. Contact forces in three directions at lower limb joints during the running stance phase were calculated. Statistical analysis employed one-dimensional statistical parameter mapping (SPM1d) and two-factor repeated measures ANOVA (time × side). Results revealed significant time × side interaction effects (p < 0.05) for contact forces in the medial–lateral direction at the hip, the anterior–posterior direction at the knee, and all three directions at the ankle. Simple effects analysis showed that post-run medial–lateral hip forces significantly increased during the push-off phase, while anterior–posterior ankle forces significantly increased during the mid-to-late stance phase on both sides (d = 0.718–1.002). For the superior–inferior direction at the hip and knee, only main effects of time or side were present. Post-run joint contact forces significantly increased, with the dominant side consistently exceeding the non-dominant side across multiple stance and push-off phases (d = 0.58–1.6), indicating stable side-to-side differences. These findings indicate that long-distance running not only increases multi-joint loading in the lower limbs but also exacerbates asymmetry between the dominant and non-dominant sides during the initial stance and push-off phases. This redistribution of load, coupled with bilateral control imbalance, may further elevate the risk of injury.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6301","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:58.187544","language":"en","tags":["engineering","open-access","sensors","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Lijuan Mao","raw_content_length":1879,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ANOVA","SPM1d","OpenSim"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1782,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Characteristics","This study","the characteristics","load changes","the hip","knee","ankle joints","the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Characteristics":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the characteristics":1.0,"load changes":1.0,"the hip":1.0,"knee":1.0,"ankle joints":1.0,"the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs":1.0}},"age_hours":18.625613715833335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3665000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5267,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8798,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0314,"sadness":0.0174,"fear":0.0169,"anger":0.0125,"disgust":0.0319},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes biomechanical data to understand load changes in lower limb joints during long-distance running.

While sustainability is generally understood as a triadic construct—economic, social, and environmental—this paper isolates the ecological pillar to highlight cross-country differences shaped by industrial legacies, institutional capacity, and governance models. A composite Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is developed using the Mazziotta–Pareto Index (MPI), which captures both average performance and internal consistency across three SDG-related domains: SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The study adds to existing literature as it includes a non-compensatory composite index and cluster analysis, and in policy terms, it provides a benchmarking system for facilitating ecological transition in the post-Soviet context. The results reveal strong divergence across the region: Baltic countries and Moldova achieve higher scores, reflecting policy convergence with the European Union and stronger environmental institutions, while Central Asian republics lag due to resource dependence, water scarcity, and weaker governance. Geographic cluster analysis corroborates these differences, showing clear spatial patterns of environmental convergence and divergence. Correlation analysis further demonstrates that environmental sustainability is positively associated with GDP per capita, HDI, and life expectancy, while negatively linked with inequality and fertility rates. These findings stress the need for context-sensitive and evidence-based policies, intra-regional cooperation, and integrated governance mechanisms to advance ecological transition in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9018","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:59.325450","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Tiziano Pavanini","raw_content_length":1826,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SDG","Clean Water and Sanitation","Post","EPI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1796,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Environmental Sustainability","the Post","This study","the environmental dimension","sustainable development","fifteen post-Soviet republics","sustainability","a triadic construct"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"research_academic":["This study"],"engineering":["sustainable development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Environmental Sustainability":2.0,"the Post":2.0,"This study":1.0,"the environmental dimension":1.0,"sustainable development":1.0,"fifteen post-Soviet republics":1.0,"sustainability":1.0,"a triadic construct":1.0}},"age_hours":18.626675945277775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8302,"joy":0.0345,"surprise":0.0338,"sadness":0.0197,"fear":0.0158,"anger":0.0291,"disgust":0.037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study provides a composite Environmental Performance Index (EPI) for post-Soviet republics, using the Mazziotta–Pareto Index (MPI) across SDG 6, 13, and 15.

Moreover, existing research on the synergistic effects of policies on ecological resilience remains insufficient. Thus, this study selects low-carbon pilot policies and smart city pilot policies to explore the possible channels through which they affect ecological resilience. Consequently, using the sample data of China’s prefecture-level cities during the period of 2005–2022, we employ a multi-period difference-in-differences approach and two-step regression to examine the relationship between dual pilot policies and ecological resilience. We find that dual pilot policies have a significant positive impact on ecological resilience, and the conclusion is still held after a series of robustness tests. We also find that regional and population size heterogeneity effects exist. Furthermore, the sequences of pilots significantly influence ecological resilience, where the sequence of implementing low-carbon pilot programs earlier than smart city pilot programs has a greater impact on ecological resilience. Finally, the dual pilot policies enhance ecological resilience through channels of technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. Overall, this study reveals the relationship between policies and ecological resilience, providing policy insights for building resilient cities.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9022","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:59.325800","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Kemei Yu","raw_content_length":1444,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Smart City","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1424,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Policy Synergy","Ecological Resilience","Evidence","Smart City","Low","ecological resilience","Pilot policies","key determinants"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Policy Synergy":2.0,"Ecological Resilience":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"Smart City":2.0,"Low":2.0,"ecological resilience":2.0,"Pilot policies":1.0,"key determinants":1.0}},"age_hours":18.626693153333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8919,"joy":0.009,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.014,"anger":0.0255,"disgust":0.0285},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study analyzes the impact of low-carbon and smart city pilot policies on ecological resilience in China using data from 2005-2022.

However, in Xinjiang—a pivotal pastoral region of China—the spatiotemporal patterns of livestock CH4 emissions remain poorly characterized, constraining regional mitigation actions. Here, a detailed CH4 emissions inventory for livestock in Xinjiang spanning the period 2000–2020 is compiled. Eight livestock categories were covered, gridded livestock maps were developed, and the dynamic emission factors were built by using the IPCC 2019 Tier 2 approaches. Results indicate that the CH4 emissions increased from ~0.7 Tg in 2000 to ~0.9 Tg in 2020, a 28.5% increase over the past twenty years. Beef cattle contributed the most to the emission increase (59.6% of total increase), followed by dairy cattle (35.7%), sheep (13.9%), and pigs (4.3%). High-emission hotspots were consistently located in the Ili River Valley, Bortala, and the northwestern margins of the Tarim Basin. Temporal trend analysis revealed increasing emission intensities in these regions, reflecting the influence of policy shifts, rangeland dynamics, and evolving livestock production systems. The high-resolution map of CH4 emissions from livestock and their temporal trends provides key insights into CH4 mitigation, with enteric fermentation showing greater potential for emission reduction. This study offers the first long-term, high-resolution CH4 emission inventory for Xinjiang, providing essential spatial insights to inform targeted mitigation strategies and enhance sustainable livestock management in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9021","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:32:59.326171","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Ye Huang","raw_content_length":1648,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CH4","IPCC"],"persons":[],"locations":["Livestock","Xinjiang","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1618,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Xinjiang","Livestock","Sustainability","Pages","Spatial","Temporal Patterns","Methane Emissions","a significant source","methane CH4 emissions","pastoral regions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Xinjiang":4.0,"Livestock":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Spatial":2.0,"Temporal Patterns":2.0,"Methane Emissions":2.0,"a significant source":1.0,"methane CH4 emissions":1.0,"pastoral regions":1.0}},"age_hours":18.626711693333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8317,"joy":0.0072,"surprise":0.0156,"sadness":0.0186,"fear":0.0256,"anger":0.0316,"disgust":0.0696},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study provides a detailed methane emissions inventory for livestock in Xinjiang from 2000-2020, quantifying the increase in emissions and identifying key contributing livestock categories and emission hotspots.

In today’s digital media environment, expert trust faces significant challenges, potentially hindering sustainable innovation adoption. This study investigates how expert credibility dimensions and information characteristics shape trust in digital transformation experts among Chinese social media users. We employed a mixed-methods approach combining a survey of 850 Chinese social media users, a quasi-experiment testing a digital expert verification feature, and secondary data analysis. The study measured multiple dimensions of expert trust while examining relationships with expert cognition factors and media usage variables through regression, mediation, and structural equation modeling. Expert trust in digital transformation exists at moderate levels (M = 6.82/10), with higher trust in digital innovation research (M = 7.12) than specific sustainability recommendations (M = 6.59). Expert authenticity emerged as the strongest predictor of trust (β = 0.27), followed by professional competence (β = 0.21). A “digital exposure paradox” emerged whereby higher volumes of expert information negatively predicted trust (β = −0.18), while information quality positively predicted trust (β = 0.25). The digital verification feature causally enhanced trust (DID = 0.57), with institutional sources strengthening trust while user-generated content diminished it. The findings reveal that digital transformation expert trust involves multi-dimensional evaluations beyond traditional credibility assessments.

This study examines the epistemological and technical consequences of relying on two dominant yet divergent platforms—OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Maps—for extracting proximity-based amenities within the 15-min city framework. Across four European contexts—Versilia, Gothenburg, Nice, and Vienna—we compare (i) data completeness and spatial coverage; (ii) semantic categories; and (iii) the effects of data heterogeneity on accessibility modelling. Findings show that OSM, while semantically consistent and openly accessible, systematically underrepresents peripheral amenities, introducing bias towards urban cores in accessibility metrics.

The role of news media is significant in shaping and enhancing discussions around many topics. This study argues that health-related topics in public discourse, transitioning from offline to online, necessitate rigorous validation. That is why this study proposed the application of deep learning techniques to the boundaries and deviation of accuracies in health-related topics by analyzing health-related tweets from major news outlets such as BBC, CNN, CBC, and Reuters. The study developed LSTM and CNN classifiers to categorize content pertinent to the discourse following the formal deep learning process and employed a sequence of VAEs to verify the learnability and stability of the classifiers. The LSTM demonstrated superior performance compared to CNN, attaining validation accuracies of 98.4% on BBC and CNN, 97.8% on CBC, and 97.3% on Reuters. The optimal configuration of our LSTM achieved a precision of 98.69%, a recall of 98.20%, and an F1-score of 97.90% and recorded the lowest false positive rate, at 1.30%. This provided us with the optimal overall equilibrium for operational oversight. The VAE runs demonstrated that the model exhibited stability and the ability to generalize across different sources, achieving approximately 99.6% for Reuters and around 98.4% for BBC. The findings confirm that deep learning models are capable of reliably tracking the online migration of health discourse driven by news media. This provides a solid foundation for near-real-time monitoring of public engagement and for informing sustainable healthcare recommendation systems.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/3987","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:00.548945","language":"en","tags":["electronics","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Fazeel Ahmed Khan","raw_content_length":1695,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN","CBC","Reuters","BBC"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1695,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Shifts","Public Discourse","Offline","Online","Deep Learning","discussions","place","social environments"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Shifts":2.0,"Public Discourse":2.0,"Offline":2.0,"Online":2.0,"Deep Learning":2.0,"discussions":2.0,"place":1.0,"social environments":1.0}},"age_hours":18.628244026388888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9226,"joy":0.0086,"surprise":0.0275,"sadness":0.0044,"fear":0.0143,"anger":0.0089,"disgust":0.0137},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deep learning model for tracking health discourse online, which could potentially inform sustainable healthcare recommendations.

Compared with traditional mercury-based ultraviolet (UV) lamps, modern UV lamps offer advantages including extended operational lifespan, high energy efficiency, compact form factor, and the absence of hazardous materials, rendering them both safer and environmentally sustainable. In particular, UV-C LED lamps, which emit at short wavelengths, are capable of disrupting the molecular structure of DNA or RNA in microbial cells, thereby inhibiting cellular replication and achieving effective disinfection and sterilization. Conventional UV-C LED sterilization lamp driver circuits frequently employ a two-stage architecture, which requires a large number of components, occupies substantial physical space, and exhibits reduced efficiency due to multiple stages of power conversion. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UV-C LED sterilization lamp driver circuit for an AC voltage supply, employing boundary conduction mode (BCM) control with integrated power factor correction (PFC). The proposed single-stage, single-switch topology combines a buck PFC converter and a flyback converter while recovering transformer leakage energy to further improve efficiency. Compared with conventional two-stage designs, the proposed circuit reduces the number of power switches and components, thereby lowering manufacturing cost and enhancing overall energy conversion efficiency. The operating principles of the proposed driver circuit are analyzed, and a prototype is developed for a 110 V AC input with an output specification of 10.8 W (90 V/0.12 A).

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_2c1c4ecf92b0","title":"Solid","content":"This article is part of our exclusive IEEE Journal Watch series in partnership with IEEE Xplore. The rapid buildout of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles is testing the limits of today’s power grid. With individual chargers drawing 350 to 500 kilowatts (or more), which makes charging times for EVs now functionally equivalent to the fill-up time for a gasoline or diesel vehicle, full charging sites can reach megawatt-scale demand. That’s enough to strain medium-voltage distribution networks—the segment of the grid that links high-voltage transmission lines with the low-voltage lines that serve end users in homes and businesses.DC fast charging stations tend to be clustered in urban centers, along highways, and in fleet depots. Because the load is not spread evenly across the network, particular substations are overworked—even when overall grid capacity is rated to accommodate the load. Overcoming this problem as more charging stations, with greater power demands, come online requires power electronics that are not only compact and efficient, but also capable of managing local storage and renewable inputs.Solid-State Transformers in EV ChargingOne of the most promising technologies for modernizing the grid so it can keep up with the demands of vehicle electrification and renewable generation is the solid-state transformer (SST). An SST performs the same basic function as a conventional transformer—stepping voltage up or down. But it does so using semiconductors, high-frequency conversion with silicon carbide or gallium nitride switches, and digital control, instead of passive magnetic coupling alone. An SST’s setup allows it to control power flow dynamically.For decades, charging infrastructure has relied on line-frequency transformers (LFTs)—massive assemblies of iron and copper that step down medium-voltage AC to low-voltage AC before or after external conversion from alternating current to the direct current that EV batteries require. A typical LFT can contain as much as a few hundred kilograms of copper windings and a few tonnes of iron. All that metal is costly and increasingly difficult to source. These systems are reliable but bulky and inefficient, especially when energy flows between local storage and vehicles. SSTs are much smaller and lighter than the LFTs they are designed to replace. “Our solution achieves the same semiconductor device count as a single-port converter while providing multiple independently controlled DC outputs.” –Shashidhar Mathapati, Delta Electronics But most multiport SSTs developed so far have been too complex or costly (between five and 10 times the upfront cost of LFTs). That difference—plus SSTs’ reliance on auxiliary battery banks that add more expense and reduce reliability—explains why solid-state’s obvious benefits have not yet incentivized shifting to the technology from LFTs. Surjakanta Mazumder, Saichand Kasicheyanula, Harisyam P.V. and Kaushik Basu hold their SST prototype in a lab.Harisyam P.V., Saichand Kasicheyanula, et al.How to Make Solid-State Transformers More EfficientIn a study published on 20 August in IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science and Delta Electronics India, both in Bengaluru, proposed what’s called a cascaded H-bridge (CHB)–based multiport SST that eliminates those compromises. “Our solution achieves the same semiconductor device count as a single-port converter while providing multiple independently controlled DC outputs,” says Shashidhar Mathapati, the CTO of Delta Electronics. “That means no additional battery storage, no extra semiconductor devices, and no extra medium-voltage insulation.”The team built a 1.2-kilowatt laboratory prototype to validate the design, achieving 95.3 percent efficiency at rated load. They also modeled a full-scale 11-kilovolt, 400-kilowatt system divided into two 200-kilowatt ports.At the heart of the system is a multi-winding transformer located on the low-voltage side of the converter. This configuration avoids the need for costly, bulky medium-voltage insulation and allows power balancing between ports without auxiliary batteries. “Previous CHB-based multiport designs needed multiple battery banks or capacitor networks to even out the load,” the authors wrote in their paper. “We’ve shown you can achieve the same result with a simpler, lighter, and more reliable transformer arrangement.”A new modulation and control strategy maintains a unity power factor at the grid interface, meaning that none of the current coming from the grid goes to waste by oscillating back and forth between the source and the load without doing any work. The SST described by the authors also allows each DC port to operate independently. In practical terms, each vehicle connected to the charger would be able to receive the appropriate voltage and current, without affecting neighboring ports or disturbing the grid connection.Using silicon-carbide switches connected in series, the system can handle medium-voltage inputs while maintaining high efficiency. An 11-kilovolt grid connection would require just 12 cascaded modules per phase, which is roughly half as many as some modular multilevel converter designs. Fewer modules ultimately means lower cost, simpler control, and greater reliability.Although still at the laboratory stage, the design could enable a new generation of compact, cost-effective fast-charging hubs. By removing the need for intermediate battery storage—which adds cost, complexity, and maintenance—the proposed topology could extend the operational lifespan of EV charging stations.According to the researchers, this converter is not just for EV charging. Any application that needs medium-voltage to multiport low-voltage conversion—such as data centers, renewable integration, or industrial DC grids—could benefit.For utilities and charging providers facing megawatt-scale demand, this streamlined solid-state transformer could help make the EV revolution more grid-friendly, and faster for drivers waiting to charge.","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ev-charging-solid-state-transformers","published_date":"2025-10-11T13:00:03","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:01.121847","language":"en","tags":["industry","charging","technology","engineering","ieee","climate_tech","cascaded_h-bridge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE Spectrum","source_category":"science","word_count":870,"author":"Willie D.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c6b76dc02584","title":"An SMN2 splicing","content":"We have recently found that by promoting transcriptional elongation, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) cooperate with the antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen (ASO1) to upregulate exon 7 (E7) inclusion into SMN2 mRNA (Marasco et al., 2022). In parallel, ASO1 also elicits the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, creating a roadblock to RNAPII elongation that downregulates E7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, HDACi counteract the undesired chromatin effects of the ASO, resulting in higher E7 inclusion, which allowed us to propose a combined therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show here that the histone methyl transferase G9a is involved in the ASO1-elicited deployment of H3K9me2 not only at the SMN2 E7 region, located towards the 3' end of the gene, but also at its promoter. Furthermore, using a CRISPR/dCas-based (dead-Cas9-based) strategy, we show that targeting H3K27 histone acetylation at the SMN2 E7 region duplicates the HDACi effect, which overcomes potentially pleiotropic effects. Most noticeably, when acetylation is targeted to the E7 region alone, the 30-kbp-distant promoter becomes acetylated and activated. These cross-talks between the two ends of the SMN2 gene prompted us to use chromosome conformation analysis (3C) to find that ASOs can promote gene looping. This novel property of ASOs depends on cohesin and may explain promoter activation by distant alternative splicing events.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681673v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:55.147566","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Stigliano, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_0ff1c4683aa3","title":"Pam3CSK4 as a Cross","content":"Polysaccharide-based vaccines are critical for preventing bacterial infections, yet their efficacy is often limited by weak antibody responses. Unfortunately, efficacious adjuvants for licensed native polysaccharide vaccines are lacking. The TLR4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), significantly increases antibody responses to capsular polysaccharides in mice via B cell-intrinsic TLR4 and MyD88-dependent signaling. However, due to the lack of TLR4-driven adjuvant effects on polysaccharide-specific responses in non-human primates and the limited responsiveness of human B cells to TLR4 agonists, we sought to identify alternative MyD88-activating TLR agonists that could serve as suitable adjuvants to enhance humoral responses to polysaccharide vaccines in humans. In vitro assays revealed the TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 synergized with strong BCR crosslinking to optimally enhance both mouse and human B cell activation and antibody secretion. In vivo, Pam3CSK4 alone had no effect, but when paired with a squalene-based emulsion significantly increased polysaccharide-specific antibodies in both immunocompetent and PBMC-humanized mice that proved highly protective against lethal pneumococcal infections. Although a dual TLR2-7 agonist showed similar potent in vitro activity, it failed to enhance polysaccharide-specific IgG responses in vivo, mirroring the antagonistic effects observed when TLR2 and TLR7 agonists were combined both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, inclusion of Pam3CSK4 in an adjuvant containing MPL, synthetic cord factor, and squalene emulsion further augmented protective polysaccharide-specific antibody responses in mice and rescued adjuvant effects in non-human primates.

Because NoRI provides rich molecular information, the analysis of its large, multi-channel datasets turns into a significant computational bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a novel, modular computational pipeline for automated segmentation and quantification of kidney tissue structures imaged with NoRI. The pipeline integrates classical image processing with state-of-the-art machine learning tools, including the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and ilastik, to segment key anatomical and biochemical features, such as tubules, nuclei, brush borders, and lumens. A custom contrast-enhancement strategy was developed to create a third SAM input channel from NoRI data, leading to a substantial improvement in segmentation performance (F1 score: 0.9226). Our framework enables accurate cytoplasm-resolved quantification of protein and lipid concentrations and reveals distinct biochemical signatures across renal tubule subtypes and experimental conditions. This method offers a robust, scalable foundation for quantitative tissue analysis and enhances the utility of NoRI imaging for biomedical research.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681509v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:55.148234","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Karmakar, R., Trim, W., Kirschner, M., Noerrelykke, S.","raw_content_length":1249,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Kidney Tissue Characterization","Segment Normalized Raman Imaging","the Segment Anything Model (SAM","NoRI"],"persons":["NoRI"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1249,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Kidney Tissue Characterization","Normalized Raman Imaging","Segment","NoRI","Normalized Raman Imaging NoRI","high-resolution label-free quantification","protein and lipid concentrations","biological tissues","rich molecular information","the analysis"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Kidney Tissue Characterization":2.0,"Normalized Raman Imaging":2.0,"Segment":2.0,"NoRI":2.0,"Normalized Raman Imaging NoRI":1.0,"high-resolution label-free quantification":1.0,"protein and lipid concentrations":1.0,"biological tissues":1.0,"rich molecular information":1.0,"the analysis":1.0}},"age_hours":18.630608907499997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8585,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7717,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.869,"joy":0.0114,"surprise":0.0482,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0199,"anger":0.0211,"disgust":0.0262},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel computational pipeline for analyzing kidney tissue using Raman imaging.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_79bf5f8469eb","title":"Novel Role of AcylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1) in Diabetic Retinopathy","content":"Hypercholesterolemia and excessive cholesterol ester (CE) production have been linked to chronic inflammation and vascular dysfunction during cardiovascular disease. Upregulation of AcylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1), the enzyme responsible for retinal CE formation, has been implicated in pathological retinal neovascularization. Here we determine the role of this process in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Ins2Akita diabetic mice were treated with the specific ACAT1/SOAT1 inhibitor K604 (10 mg/Kg, i.p.) beginning at 10 weeks for 2 weeks or 8 months for 2 months. ACAT1/SOAT1 expression and CE formation were assayed along with oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, and neuronal function. ACAT1/SOAT1 expression was also assayed in human retinas and vitrectomy specimens. Retinas from early-stage Ins2Akita mice exhibited increases in CE deposition, superoxide production, and expression of ACAT1/SOAT1, LDLR, TREM1, MCSF, and VEGF along with leukostasis, vascular leakage, acellular capillary formation, retinal ganglion cell loss, and impaired visual function. Late-stage increases in CE, ACAT1/SOAT, oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired visual function were also observed. These changes were significantly inhibited by K604 treatment. The protective effects were independent of changes in systemic glucose or body weight. Human retina and vitrectomy samples also showed increases in ACAT1/SOAT1 and CE, respectively. Specific inhibition of ACAT1/SOAT1 with K604 normalizes ACAT1/SOAT1 expression and CE formation and prevents increases in oxidative stress and inflammation and preserves retinal structure and function in both early and late stages of DR. These findings identify ACAT1/SOAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for both early intervention and later stage treatment of DR.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681484v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:55.148558","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Zaidi, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6aa886f27933","title":"Quality","content":"Quantitative fluorescence microscopy is more reproducible when instrument performance is measured and incorporated into the analysis. We show that routinely monitored quality-control (QC) metrics like the system resolution and inter-channel co-registration are determinant variables that can be used to normalize common image readouts and thereby separate instrument-induced variation from genuine biological changes. For intra-channel morphometry, a Gaussian approximation of the fluorescence imaging process yields analytical factors that predict how geometric measurements (length, separation distance, area, volume, etc.) inflate and scale with resolution blur due to optical misalignments or natural optical quality variations. We validate this behavior by deliberately perturbing the system resolution and by exploiting the natural resolution differences in three nominally equivalent objective lenses configured to image the exact same synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons, where structural differences subtle by eye nonetheless produced statistically significant shifts in measured synaptic puncta volumes. For dual-channel colocalization (overlap) measurements, we normalize the inter-channel co-registration QC metric by the measured point-spread function (PSF) resolutions (rather than theoretical limits associated with the objective lens) and demonstrate how fluorescent pre/postsynaptic cleft protein overlap signals decay in a predictable, exponential fashion as the PSF-normalized registration error increases, with the decay rate depending on the imaged object relative to the PSF size ratio. Mapped field-of-view gradients in channel registration also explain feature orientation flips/rotations and overlap loss without any underlying biological change . Finally, we outline a simple QC-aware microscope normalization workflow where each image measurement dataset is paired with its session PSFs and local co-registration error to remove instrument bias and optionally re-project the results to a declared reference PSF without altering the raw images. This approach improves image measurement accuracy and cross-instrument comparability of experiments and reframes light microscope QC from a passive certification of instrument health into a practical normalization that links the acquisition state to quantitative outcomes, thus ensuring the reliability and interpretability of morphometric and colocalization data in fluorescence microscopy.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681494v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:55.148906","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":318,"author":"Oreopoulos, J., Nelson, G., Gastinger, M., Morrison, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_022019a50258","title":"Divergent roles for complement components C3 and C4 in controlling Klebsiella pneumoniae gut colonization and systemic dissemination","content":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is an escalating public health threat driven by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant and hyper-encapsulated strains that spread systemically from the gut. The immune defenses preventing gut colonization and dissemination remain poorly defined. Herein, we uncover distinct and context-dependent roles for complement proteins C3 and C4 in host defense following K. pneumoniae infection. Following gut colonization, C3 and C4 levels rise significantly. In addition to inducing alternative pathway-mediated C3b deposition on K. pneumoniae grown under gut-relevant conditions, C3 is critical for recruiting myeloid cells to the gut, promoting local opsonophagocytosis, and preventing lethal systemic spread. Depletion of systemic C3 reveals mucosal-derived C3 controls K. pneumoniae GI colonization, whereas systemic C3 is essential for limiting fatal dissemination. In contrast, C4 is dispensable for controlling GI colonization, dissemination, and myeloid recruitment under conditions of natural acquisition. However, C4 becomes critical for controlling GI burden and systemic disease following antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and supercolonization with antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae. Collectively, these findings reveal a dual-layered immune strategy: C3-driven opsonophagocytosis is critical for controlling colonization and dissemination under baseline conditions, while C4 becomes indispensable following antibiotic-induced supercolonization. This work advances our understanding of complement-dependent mucosal immune protection and identifies potential targets for preventing gut-to-bloodstream transition of this pathogen.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681492v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:33:55.149229","language":"en","tags":["preprints","life-sciences","cutting-edge","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Valencia-Bacca, J.

{"id":"ai_engadget_430e5cae57c2","title":"The beloved Chevrolet Bolt is back but only for a 'limited run'","content":"One of the most affordable EVs in America, the Chevrolet Bolt, has made its long-awaited comeback. After discontinuing the Bolt in 2023, the American automaker has refreshed the popular EV with a 2027 model that has some key upgrades. Chevy said the new Bolt will be available at dealerships in the first quarter of 2026, starting with a comfort trim that goes for at least $29,990. The updated Bolt will get even cheaper in the coming months when Chevy releases an LT base model that starts at $28,995. That price tag offers an upgraded EV with an estimated range of 255 miles and peak charging speeds of up to 150kW. According to Chevy, the new Bolt can charge 2.5x faster than the previous model, which often saw complaints about charging speed. Now with a new LFP battery, the 2027 Bolt can charge from 10 to 80 percent in 26 minutes and has access to both DC fast charging and Tesla's Supercharger network thanks to a native NACS port. Along with an 11-inch driver display, the Chevy Bolt is built with an 11.3-inch infotainment display that can handle navigation, music, and entertainment with Google built-in. Notably, the refreshed Bolt doesn't have Apple CarPlay compatibility, even though previous models did. Chevrolet While Chevy revived the Bolt, it returns as a \"limited run model.\" The carmaker said in a statement that it \"moved quickly to retain the nameplate in our portfolio for a little longer, after hearing feedback from ending production,\" and added that the \"Bolt will be available for a limited time...as one of our highest volume EVs at Chevrolet.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-beloved-chevrolet-bolt-is-back-but-only-for-a-limited-run-161552328.html?src=rss","source":"ai_engadget","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-beloved-chevrolet-bolt-is-back-but-only-for-a-limited-run-161552328.html?src=rss","published_date":"2025-10-11T16:16:25","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:34:22.163257","language":"en","tags":["transportation","siteengadget","technology","headline","consumer","regionus","gadgets","languageen-us"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics","source_category":"ai","word_count":275,"author":"Jackson Chen","raw_content_length":2701,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Chevy","Chevrolet","LFP"],"persons":["Bolt","Tesla"],"locations":["America"],"monetary":["at least $29,990","28,995"]},"char_count":1750,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The beloved Chevrolet Bolt","a limited run","Chevy","the most affordable EVs","America","the Chevrolet Bolt","its long-awaited comeback","the Bolt","the American automaker","the popular EV"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["its long-awaited comeback"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The beloved Chevrolet Bolt":2.0,"a limited run":2.0,"Chevy":2.0,"the most affordable EVs":1.0,"America":1.0,"the Chevrolet Bolt":1.0,"its long-awaited comeback":1.0,"the Bolt":1.0,"the American automaker":1.0,"the popular EV":1.0}},"age_hours":2.358625152222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.875,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.775,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8932,"joy":0.0326,"surprise":0.0516,"sadness":0.0132,"fear":0.002,"anger":0.0047,"disgust":0.0029},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the re-introduction of the Chevrolet Bolt EV with upgrades including faster charging speeds and a new battery.
