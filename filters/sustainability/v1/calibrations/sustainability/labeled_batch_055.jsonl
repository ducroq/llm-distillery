{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c376e430166c","title":"Reclamevrij bingewatchen verleden tijd? Streamingdiensten grijpen naar advertenties","content":"Netflix hield jarenlang reclame buiten de deur. Maar voor hoelang nog? In andere landen draaien al spotjes op Netflix, en adverteerders staan te popelen om - net als bij andere streamingdiensten - in te kopen. Hoe komt het dat de 'reclamevrije' videoplatformen nu toch advertenties verkopen? De opkomst van de Amerikaanse streamingdienstpionier Netflix veranderde het film- en televisielandschap voorgoed. Als kijker hoefde je voor het eerst niet meer te wachten tot je favoriete serie weer op de tv te zien was; je koos je eigen moment. Zonder advertenties. Met de komst van Disney+, Amazon Prime en HBO Max verloor Netflix de monopoliepositie. In Nederland kreeg Videoland een stevige voet aan de grond. En die videodiensten deden iets wat Netflix niet wilde: advertenties aanbieden. Door de groeiende concurrentie moest Netflix er ook aan geloven. In de meeste landen waar je kijkt krijg je - voordat je een serie of film aanzet - een reclame te zien. In Nederland nog niet, maar Netflix is wel bezig om dit te testen. Al benadrukt een woordvoerder dat dit niet op korte termijn wordt ingevoerd. Groeicijfers Dat streamingdiensten met advertenties zijn begonnen, heeft alles te maken met de groeicijfers, ziet Jan-Piet Nelissen, streamingexpert bij Deloitte. Videoplatformen hebben grofweg twee manieren om te groeien, legt hij uit. \"De eerste is nieuwe huishoudens die een abonnement afsluiten. In Nederland heeft zeven op de tien huishoudens een abonnement op een of meerdere platformen\", vertelt Nelissen. De andere groeimanier is het zogeheten stapelen. \"Dat wil zeggen binnen één huishouden meerdere abonnementen.\" Dat stimuleren streamingplatformen onder andere door de mogelijkheden te beperken om je abonnement te delen en daardoor sluiten nog meer mensen een abonnement af. Maar de rek bij die groeimogelijkheden is eruit, ziet Nelissen. Bijna iedereen die een streamingabonnement wil, heeft er eentje. En met gemiddeld een kleine drie abonnementen per huishouden is daar de groei laatste jaren ook uit. Daar komt nog bij dat de kosten voor film- en tv-producties flink zijn gestegen. En dus kiezen de streaminggiganten voor advertenties om de kosten te kunnen dekken. Veel kijkers reageren op sociale media dat de reclames hen irriteren. Maar ze kunnen er maar beter aan wennen, denkt Michel van der Voort van tv-brancheorganisatie Screenforce. \"Reclame-inkomsten worden een soort tweede bron van inkomsten voor de streamingplatforms. Ze zien zelf nu ook wel: we gaan het niet meer redden met alleen maar de abonneeverkopen.\" Gerichter De optie om te adverteren op streamingplatformen grijpen marketingbureaus die advertenties inkopen voor bedrijven met beide handen aan, blijkt uit een rondgang van de NOS. Op deze manier adverteren is anders dan in reclameblokken op televisie. \"De reclameblokken zijn veel korter, dus je valt veel meer op\", vertelt Remon Buter van mediabureau WPP Media. Daar komt nog eens bij dat de advertenties veel gerichter kunnen worden getoond dan op televisie. Waar je bij televisie een brede, diverse groep bereikt, kunnen streamingdiensten per kijker bepalen welke reclame diegene ziet. \"Het is allemaal veel specifieker\", vertelt Vanessa Hofland van advertentiebureau Monks. \"Je hebt genres en doelgroepen en daardoor kun je veel persoonlijker adverteren. Daarom zijn al die grote advertentiepartijen daar geïnteresseerd in.\" Slecht nieuws voor lineaire tv? Toch hoeft die verschuiving niet meteen slecht nieuws te zijn voor de lineaire televisie, denkt Van der Voort. \"B&B Vol Liefde is een goed voorbeeld. Er wordt massaal gekeken via tv én via Videoland. Die twee gaan elkaar steeds meer aanvullen.\" Saskia Baneke van marketingbrancheorganisatie Via Nederland sluit zich daarbij aan. \"Als ik het niet red om na het eten het Jeugdjournaal te kijken met de kinderen, dan kijk ik het toch gewoon lekker terug? Er gaat een generatie aankomen waaraan je het begrip 'lineair' op een gegeven moment moet gaan uitleggen.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586108","published_date":"2025-10-11T15:45:15","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:31:07.861797","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":612,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4368,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Netflix"],"persons":["Amazon Prime","Netflix"],"locations":["Nederland","Videoland"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3960,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["advertenties","Reclamevrij","verleden","Streamingdiensten","reclame","de deur","hoelang nog","andere landen","spotjes","adverteerders"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"advertenties":3.0,"Reclamevrij":2.0,"verleden":2.0,"Streamingdiensten":2.0,"reclame":1.0,"de deur":1.0,"hoelang nog":1.0,"andere landen":1.0,"spotjes":1.0,"adverteerders":1.0}},"age_hours":2.8629381352777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7164,"joy":0.0069,"surprise":0.0548,"sadness":0.0192,"fear":0.119,"anger":0.044,"disgust":0.0397},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the shift of streaming services towards incorporating advertisements, driven by the saturation of subscription growth and rising production costs.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_01d88a6763ef","title":"Racisme in het jeugdvoetbal: 'De eerstvolgende keer stappen we van het veld'","content":"Ibrahim speelt in de JO17-1 van Alexandria '66, een Rotterdams voetbalteam van 15- en 16-jarigen dat op een behoorlijk hoog niveau speelt. Het afgelopen seizoen werd hij zeker drie keer uitgescholden. Zo was er die tegenstander die tijdens de wedstrijd tegen hem zei dat hij \"terug moest naar Marokko\". Hij probeerde nog uit te leggen dat hij in Nederland is geboren. \"Net als die jongen zelf dus. Maar dat leek hij niet te horen. Na afloop heb ik hem nog mijn hand aangeboden, maar die weigerde hij. Nou ja, zijn probleem, ik heb wel ergere dingen meegemaakt.\" Erger vond Ibrahim die toeschouwer bij een andere wedstrijd die riep dat hij een \"fietsendief\" was. \"Puur kennelijk vanwege mijn Marokkaanse achtergrond. Een ouder iemand, van wie je verwacht dat hij iets langer nadenkt. Ik zeg op dat soort momenten tegen mezelf: boeien, hij is zielig, niet ik. Maar in eerste instantie voel je je toch wel even vies.\" De Turks-Nederlandse spits Milas deelt dat gevoel. Een tegenstander die \"kankerbuitenlander\" tegen hem zegt in het heetst van de strijd, daar kan hij met enige moeite nog zijn schouders over ophalen. \"Maar van mensen die dertig jaar ouder zijn dan ik verwacht ik iets anders. De generaties voor ons zouden toch het goede voorbeeld moeten geven?\" Niet dat het Milas echt verbaast. \"Ik ben een jongen uit Rotterdam-Zuid, ik maak van alles mee. Ook buiten het veld. Laatst ging ik na het voetbal nog even snel wat halen bij de supermarkt. Zegt iemand zomaar 'straatjunk' tegen mij. Hij zou eens moeten weten: ik sport zeven keer per week, mijn hele leven bestaat uit discipline. Zo'n man weet helemaal niks van mij, maar heeft wel zijn mening klaar, alleen op basis van mijn uiterlijk.\" Ook Qinhao krijgt vaak te maken met racisme op het voetbalveld: 23 spelers maar liefst kent de selectie van de JO17-1, met heel verschillende achtergronden. Er zijn witte Nederlanders die Guus of Max heten, maar ook spelers met Surinaamse, Antilliaanse, Marokkaanse, Turkse en zelfs Colombiaanse wortels. Desondanks vormen zij een hechte groep, samen met hun trainer Kevin en zijn assistent Yusuf. Discriminatie is een issue voor ze; de meesten hebben er direct of indirect ooit weleens mee te maken gehad. Dat geldt zelfs voor Jay-Jay. Hij mag dan een witte Nederlander zijn; kennelijk zorgen zijn donkere krullen en bruine ogen voor misverstanden. Zelfs hij werd recentelijk een aantal keer voor \"kutmarokkaan\" uitgemaakt. Discriminatie uit frustratie Niet altijd komt dit voort uit onvervalst racisme, weten de jongens. Fanatiek beoefend is voetbal een zeer fysieke sport met veel emoties, waarin soms sowieso nare dingen tegen elkaar worden gezegd. Ben je wat zwaarder, dan heet je al snel \"bolle\". Zeker na bijvoorbeeld een stevige tackle kan het goed misgaan. Een speler van een ander team, Ibtissam van de meisjes onder 20 van Elinkwijk, heeft daar een rake omschrijving voor: \"Discriminatie uit frustratie.\" Maar helaas hebben ook zij en haar medespelers, net als hun trainer Achmed, geregeld te maken met nog ernstiger zaken. Vooral bij bepaalde clubs die zelf weinig of geen minderheden in hun teams hebben. Met als dieptepunt moeders met een hoofddoek die bij een uitwedstrijd werden bekogeld met plastic flesjes energiedrank. \"Ik voel het soms al als ik bij een uitwedstrijd het terrein op kom: dit zou weleens een ongezellige middag kunnen worden\", zegt Achmed. \"En dat klopt dan eigenlijk altijd helaas. Ik maak me daar wel zorgen over, met het oog op de politieke discussies van dit moment. De maatschappelijke spanningen lijken alleen maar groter te worden, hoeveel erger gaat dit nog worden?\" 'Je vuisten mag je niet gebruiken' Over één ding zijn alle spelers en begeleiders het eens: woedend worden heeft op dat soort momenten geen zin, wat voor vreselijke dingen er ook tegen je worden gezegd. Ryan, van de huidige JO19-2 van FC Abcoude, is dat in het verleden weleens overkomen: hij kwam met zijn tegenstander in een vechtpartij terecht. \"Allebei werden we een aantal wedstrijden geschorst door de KNVB. En dat snap ik ook wel: je mag in het voetbal je vuisten gewoon niet gebruiken, daar bereik je niks mee. Onze trainers hebben dat destijds best goed opgelost, ik heb later nog een ontmoeting met die andere speler gehad - ouders erbij.\" Maar trainer Kevin van Alexandria '66 heeft er kortgeleden met zijn spelers nog over gesproken: inmiddels vinden ze het wel genoeg geweest. De eerstvolgende keer dat een van zijn jongens zich dit seizoen racistisch bejegend voelt, stapt het hele team van het veld. \"Gewoon om een daad te stellen.\" (Sommige (voor)namen in dit artikel zijn op verzoek van de spelers veranderd.)","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586102","published_date":"2025-10-11T15:15:01","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:31:07.863826","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":765,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4919,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Ibrahim","Marokko","Alexandria"],"locations":["Nederland"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4635,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hij","Racisme","het jeugdvoetbal","De eerstvolgende keer","het veld","de JO17-1","voetbalteam","16-jarigen","dat","een behoorlijk hoog niveau"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["dat"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hij":5.0,"Racisme":2.0,"het jeugdvoetbal":2.0,"De eerstvolgende keer":2.0,"het veld":2.0,"de JO17-1":1.0,"voetbalteam":1.0,"16-jarigen":1.0,"dat":1.0,"een behoorlijk hoog niveau":1.0}},"age_hours":3.3668477669444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.43200000000000016,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9136,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3078,"joy":0.015,"surprise":0.0291,"sadness":0.0344,"fear":0.4181,"anger":0.0908,"disgust":0.1049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The concrete action is the team's decision to walk off the field if racist behavior occurs.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_fc4ca7581ad6","title":"Wilders voorlopig niet in debat, dit weten we nu over de dreiging","content":"PVV-leider Geert Wilders heeft zijn campagne in de aanloop naar de verkiezingen op 29 oktober stilgelegd, in verband met een dreiging. Volgens Belgische media was hij een van de mogelijke doelwitten van een Belgische terreurcel, die ook een aanslag wilde plegen op de Belgische premier Bart De Wever. Dit is wat we nu weten. Wat weten we over de verdachten? Wat weten we nu over de dreiging? Politiek verslaggever Jorn Jonker: \"De worsteling bij andere partijen wordt alleen maar erger nu het er sterk op lijkt dat Wilders ook bij het RTL-debat niet mee gaat doen. Ze vinden deze dreiging allemaal verschrikkelijk voor hem, maar ze vinden de gevolgen ook verschrikkelijk voor het democratische proces. Bij verkiezingen hoort dat lijsttrekkers elkaar kritisch kunnen bevragen en dat journalisten dat ook kunnen bij partijleiders. Dat is momenteel onmogelijk bij Wilders, terwijl het vlak voor de verkiezingen is en bijvoorbeeld de online campagne richting de eigen potentiële achterban wel doorgaat. En Wilders haalde zelf eerder ook aan dat hij op tv veel wordt genoemd zonder dat hij hoeft te verschijnen. Kortom: het campagnevoeren gaat door, maar dan zonder kritische confrontatie. Het ongemak bij andere partijen is er des te meer omdat meerdere politici zich afvragen of hij niet sneller dan anders deze dreiging een reden laat zijn om optredens af te zeggen om zo kritische vragen te ontlopen. Hij leeft immers al lang met verschrikkelijke dreiging en de locaties voor de debatten zijn zwaar beveiligd. Denkt Wilders wellicht dat als je er zo goed voorstaat in de peilingen je alleen maar kan verliezen met zulke optredens, vragen ze zich af. Dat klinkt achter de schermen. Tegelijkertijd is er ook telkens 'de bijsluiter' te horen dat, ook al zegt de NCTV dat er geen 'restdreiging' meer is vanuit de aangehouden verdachten, ze het kunnen begrijpen dat je van het nieuws over zo'n mogelijke terreurcel van slag bent en het moeilijk kan zijn om op een campagne te focussen.\" Hoe wordt er op gereageerd?

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_f5680d1843b9","title":"Barendrechtse wethouder slaapt buiten om aandacht te vragen voor dakloosheid","content":"De Barendrechtse wethouder Roeland Bol (EVB) heeft vannacht buiten geslapen om aandacht te vragen voor de groeiende groep mensen zonder vaste woon- of verblijfplaats. Bol koos voor deze nacht omdat het vandaag Werelddaklozendag is. Hij lag in een slaapzak op een talud bij het station in Barendrecht, een locatie waar daklozen vaker overnachten. \"Wat overheerste was het gevoel van eenzaamheid en kwetsbaarheid\", zegt hij tegen Rijnmond. De wethouder (Sociaal Domein) heeft alles bij elkaar anderhalf uur geslapen. Nare dingen maakte hij niet mee, behalve een kat die midden in de nacht op hem sprong. Ook hoorde hij het luide uitgaanspubliek dat op weg naar huis was. \"Toen het geluid op het station verstomde, voelde ik me toch eenzaam en op mezelf aangewezen\", zegt hij. Bij kennissen op de bank In Barendrecht zijn op dit moment acht tot tien mensen dakloos. Maar er is ook een groep die op de rand van dakloosheid balanceert. \"We vermoeden dat tussen de 20 en 25 mensen bij kennissen slapen of de nacht in de auto doorbrengen\", zegt hij. De groeiende groep baart hem zorgen, want bij vrienden of familie slapen is geen structurele oplossing. \"Dan moeten ze ook daar weg en dan belanden ze op straat.\" En dat wil Bol voorkomen. Met zijn actie om de nacht buiten door te brengen wil hij aandacht vragen voor de inwoners in een kwetsbare positie. Ook wil hij een signaal afgeven aan mensen die zich schamen voor hun situatie of denken dat ze het alleen moeten oplossen. \"Dakloosheid kan iedereen overkomen. Mensen scheiden, raken hun baan kwijt en komen ongewild op straat terecht. Voor een sociale huurwoningen kom je op een lange wachtlijst terecht en ook particulier is het lastig een woning te vinden\", zegt Bol. Buut Vrij Om deze groep te helpen, werkt de wethouder op eigen initiatief aan het project Buut Vrij.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_7c5e15e8c301","title":"Zeker 60 doden in Sudan bij droneaanval op vluchtelingen","content":"Bij een droneaanval op een opvanglocatie voor vluchtelingen in Sudan zijn minstens zestig mensen gedood, melden lokale activisten. De aanval wordt toegeschreven aan de paramilitaire groep Rapid Support Forces (RSF), die al tweeënhalf jaar verwikkeld is in een bloedige strijd met het regeringsleger. De aanval vond plaats in El-Fasher, in de regio Darfur in het westen van Sudan. Het is de laatste grote stad die in handen is van het regeringsleger. In het opvangcentrum, waar vroeger een universiteit stond, schuilden veel Sudanese burgers voor het geweld in de stad. Het dodental kan nog verder oplopen, omdat er nog mensen onder het puin liggen. Lokale autoriteiten spreken van een bloedbad en zeggen dat onder de doden ook vrouwen en kinderen zijn. De opvang was al twee keer eerder doelwit van drones en werd ook bestookt met artilleriegranaten. El-Fasher wordt al anderhalf jaar belegerd door de rebellengroep RSF. De stad ligt strategisch en geldt als het laatste bolwerk van het regeringsleger. Dagelijks vinden daar hevige gevechten plaats. Bij aanvallen van de RSF werden afgelopen week nog 53 burgers gedood in El-Fasher, en raakten 60 anderen gewond, meldde de Hoge Commissaris voor de Mensenrechten van de VN, Volker Türk. Bloedige oorlog In Sudan woedt al 30 maanden een bloedige oorlog tussen het regeringsleger en de Arabische militie RSF. Die brak uit nadat de leiders van beide partijen samen een staatsgreep hadden gepleegd en het vervolgens niet eens werden over de verdeling van de macht. Ondertussen vechten ook andere gewapende groepen mee. Die worden weer gesteund door verschillende landen, vooral de Golfstaten. De VN noemt het op dit moment de grootste humanitaire ramp ter wereld. Vorig jaar riep de IPC, de voedselwaakhond van de VN, op meerdere plekken in Sudan officieel hongersnood uit. Een doel van het uitroepen van hongersnood is dat er meer hulp komt. Want er zijn wel mogelijkheden, ook als internationale hulp beperkt naar binnen kan. Zo zijn er veel lokale soepkeukens. Maar de VN heeft slechts 6 procent binnen van het geld om mensen te helpen in Sudan. Ook worden bij aanvallen steeds vaker drones ingezet. In september nog was een moskee in vluchtelingenkamp in El-Fasher het doelwit van een droneaanval van de RSF. Daarbij werden 75 mensen gedood. Lang gold El-Fasher als een veilige haven, voor mensen op de vlucht voor het geweld in andere delen van het land. Maar sinds anderhalf jaar is de stad een frontlijn waar niemand veilig is. Burgers in El-Fasher worden afgesneden van voedsel, water en medicijnen, en mensen worden gedwongen om veevoer aan hun kinderen te geven. Journalisten kunnen het gebied niet in en ook in de rest van het land zijn amper journalisten. De VN-mensenrechtenorganisatie OHCHR schreef in een recent rapport dat de humanitaire crisis in Sudan zich de afgelopen zes maanden heeft verdiept, en het aantal burgerdoden is toegenomen. Waarnemers, waaronder Human Rights Watch, waarschuwen al langer voor etnische zuivering en genocide in de regio Darfur.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586085","published_date":"2025-10-11T13:40:12","collected_date":"2025-10-11T18:31:07.867575","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":485,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3880,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.425,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RSF","Rapid Support","Forces"],"persons":[],"locations":["Sudan","El-Fasher"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3021,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["vluchtelingen","droneaanval","De aanval","die","het regeringsleger","een droneaanval","een opvanglocatie","minstens zestig mensen","lokale activisten","de paramilitaire groep"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["de paramilitaire groep"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"vluchtelingen":3.0,"droneaanval":2.0,"De aanval":2.0,"die":2.0,"het regeringsleger":2.0,"een droneaanval":1.0,"een opvanglocatie":1.0,"minstens zestig mensen":1.0,"lokale activisten":1.0,"de paramilitaire groep":1.0}},"age_hours":4.947177595833334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.3655,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7269,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6846,"joy":0.0147,"surprise":0.09,"sadness":0.0407,"fear":0.0593,"anger":0.0479,"disgust":0.0627},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reports on the human cost of conflict in Sudan, specifically a drone attack on a refugee camp.
