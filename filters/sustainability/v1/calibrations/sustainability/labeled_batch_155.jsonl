{"id":"science_plos_one_fef06a4b0788","title":"Disparities and trends of the incidence and mortality of female","content":"by Ze Zhang, Yunhai Li, Hongbo Huang, Tingting Wei, Ying Huang, Xiuquan Qu, Yijing Xu, Aijie Zhang, Jiaying Li, Zheng Gong, Zhiqi Hu, Fan Li Background Female-specific cancers (FSCs) impose substantial burdens on healthcare systems and economies worldwide. The significant impact of these cancers in the United States warrants further investigation. Objective This study aimed to analyze trends in incidence and mortality rates of six female-specific cancers (breast, cervical, uterine, ovarian, vaginal, and vulvar cancers) among diverse racial and ethnic groups in the United States, and to evaluate the attributable contributions of major risk factors to the cancer death burden as well as their temporal changes. Methods Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the SEER (22 registry) database, to examine cross-sectional and temporal trends by race/ethnicity. The burden of FSCs attributable to specific risk factors was estimated based on the Global Burden of Disease 2021 database. Results Between 2017 and 2021, Breast cancer incidence increased across all racial groups, most notably among non-Hispanic White (White) women, while mortality declined. Cervical cancer incidence decreased in most groups but remained stable among American Indians and Alaska Native (AIAN) women. Uterine cancer incidence increased across all racial groups, except for Whites. Incidence and mortality rates for ovarian and vaginal cancers remained stable or decreased, whereas vulvar cancer mortality was highest among White and AIAN women and lowest among non-Hispanic Asian Americans and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women. From 2000 to 2021, risk-attributable deaths decreased for breast, cervical, and ovarian cancers but increased for uterine cancer. Conclusions Significant sociodemographic disparities and unfavorable trends persist in the incidence and mortality of all six major female-specific cancers, highlighting the importance for effective prevention and intervention strategies.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334128","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.075342","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":280,"author":"Fan Li","raw_content_length":2026,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.4,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Methods Incidence","Zheng Gong","Zhiqi Hu","Hongbo Huang","Aijie Zhang","Ze Zhang","Yunhai Li","Jiaying Li","Xiuquan Qu","Tingting Wei","Yijing Xu","Fan Li Background Female","Ying Huang"],"locations":["the United States","ovarian"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1984,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["trends","Disparities","the incidence","mortality","female","Ze Zhang","Yunhai Li","Hongbo Huang","Tingting Wei","Ying Huang"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Yunhai Li"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"trends":3.0,"Disparities":2.0,"the incidence":2.0,"mortality":2.0,"female":2.0,"Ze Zhang":1.0,"Yunhai Li":1.0,"Hongbo Huang":1.0,"Tingting Wei":1.0,"Ying Huang":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7817788624999995,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5865,"joy":0.011,"surprise":0.037,"sadness":0.229,"fear":0.0662,"anger":0.0281,"disgust":0.0422},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes trends in cancer incidence and mortality using the SEER database, providing concrete data on health outcomes.

De weduwe van Kirk nam de onderscheiding in ontvangst. De ceremonie viel samen met wat de 32-ste verjaardag van Kirk zou zijn geweest. De onderscheiding is de hoogste burgerlijke onderscheiding van het land. \"Vandaag zijn we hier om een onverschrokken strijder voor vrijheid te eren en te herdenken, een geliefde leider die de volgende generatie heeft geïnspireerd\", zei Trump tijdens de ceremonie. Doodgeschoten op campus Charlie Kirk werd in september op de campus van de Utah Valley University doodgeschoten tijdens een bijeenkomst met studenten. Kirk was een invloedrijke conservatieve activist en vertrouweling van de Amerikaanse president Trump. De president noemde Kirk een van de belangrijkste redenen waarom hij herkozen is. Tyler Robinson, de man die ervan wordt verdacht dat hij Kirk heeft doodgeschoten, wordt aangeklaagd voor moord. De Amerikaanse openbaar aanklager in de staat Utah is voornemens om de doodstraf te eisen tegen de 22-jarige Robinson. Medal of Freedom De Presidential Medal of Freedom werd in 1963 door president John F. Kennedy ingesteld voor mensen die uitzonderlijke bijdragen leveren \"aan de veiligheid of nationale belangen van de Verenigde Staten, de wereldvrede, culturele of andere belangrijke publieke of private ondernemingen\". Eerder kregen onder andere Steve Jobs, Elvis Presley, Rosa Parks en turnster Simone Biles de onderscheiding.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586494","published_date":"2025-10-14T23:24:14","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:50:57.245480","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":227,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1879,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Presidential Medal"],"persons":["Kirk","Donald Trump","Charlie Kirk","Valley","University","Tyler Robinson","Trump"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1542,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hoge onderscheiding","De Amerikaanse president","Freedom postuum","de vorige maand","radicaal-rechtse activist","De weduwe","de onderscheiding","ontvangst","De ceremonie","wat de 32-ste verjaardag"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hoge onderscheiding":2.0,"De Amerikaanse president":1.0,"Freedom postuum":1.0,"de vorige maand":1.0,"radicaal-rechtse activist":1.0,"De weduwe":1.0,"de onderscheiding":1.0,"ontvangst":1.0,"De ceremonie":1.0,"wat de 32-ste verjaardag":1.0}},"age_hours":2.6131194819444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6808,"joy":0.0282,"surprise":0.1494,"sadness":0.0322,"fear":0.0321,"anger":0.0435,"disgust":0.0338},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":0,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":0,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article discusses a political award.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_b59c96894945","title":"Opnieuw speedboot bij Venezuela opgeblazen door Amerikaanse leger","content":"Voor de kust van Venezuela is opnieuw een speedboot opgeblazen door de Amerikaanse strijdkrachten. President Trump zegt dat zes opvarenden zijn gedood. Hij beweert dat het drugsmokkelaars waren, maar leverde daarvoor geen bewijs. Het is de vijfde dodelijke aanval van de Amerikaanse marine op een schip in het Caribisch gebied sinds vorige maand. Latijns-Amerikaanse landen vrezen de groeiende militaire agressie die de VS vertoont. Een juridische basis voor de Amerikaanse aanvallen in internationale wateren lijkt te ontbreken. Trump heeft een aantal drugskartels tot terreurorganisaties bestempeld en spreekt van een oorlog tegen \"narcoterroristen\". De aanval van vandaag zou zijn uitgevoerd op basis van informatie van inlichtingendiensten. Volgens Trump vervoerde het schip drugs. Het is een patroon dat de VS dit soort bootjes aanvalt zonder bewijs te leveren over wie of wat er aan boord was. Venezuela vreest Amerikaanse aanval Amerika heeft extra oorlogsschepen en gevechtsvliegtuigen verzameld in het Caribisch gebied. Venezuela stelt dat de VS plannen heeft voor militaire aanvallen op Venezolaans grondgebied met het doel om president Maduro ten val te brengen. Het Zuid-Amerikaanse land heeft vorige week de VN-Veiligheidsraad gevraagd om een spoedzitting over de Amerikaanse militaire acties. Trump stelt dat militair ingrijpen tegen drugssmokkelaars nodig is om de VS te beschermen. \"Als je onze mensen probeert te vergiftigen, zullen we je opblazen. Dat is de enige taal die ze echt verstaan\", zei de president onlangs in een toespraak voor generaals. Ook in de VS zet Trump steeds vaker de strijdkrachten in tegen al dan niet vermeende criminelen, en ook om demonstraties de kop in te drukken. De Nationale Garde wordt tot nu toe alleen ingezet in steden met Democratische burgemeesters. Juristen zeggen dat Trump zich steeds autocratischer opstelt.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586486","published_date":"2025-10-14T20:41:22","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:50:57.246386","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":280,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2406,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.4,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Trump"],"persons":["President Trump","Trump"],"locations":["Venezuela"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1866,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["speedboot","Amerikaanse leger","de kust","een speedboot","de Amerikaanse strijdkrachten","President","opvarenden","Hij","het drugsmokkelaars","geen bewijs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"speedboot":2.0,"Amerikaanse leger":2.0,"de kust":1.0,"een speedboot":1.0,"de Amerikaanse strijdkrachten":1.0,"President":1.0,"opvarenden":1.0,"Hij":1.0,"het drugsmokkelaars":1.0,"geen bewijs":1.0}},"age_hours":5.327578574444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7116,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.1163,"sadness":0.0339,"fear":0.0349,"anger":0.0411,"disgust":0.0501},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"transition_delay","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes military actions, specifically the destruction of boats.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_56128a50b87a","title":"Demonstraties voor en tegen azc's in Houten en Uithoorn, ME grijpt in","content":"In Houten en Uithoorn zijn demonstraties rond de komst van een azc vanavond uitgelopen op ongeregeldheden. Bij beide protesten heeft de Mobiele Eenheid (ME) mensen aangehouden. In Houten waren er in ieder geval drie aanhoudingen, in Uithoorn tot nu toe vier, meldt NH Nieuws. Ook is in beide plaatsen de Prinsenvlag gezien, die in de oorlog door de NSB werd gebruikt. Zowel in Houten als in Uithoorn werd de ME ingezet: In Houten greep de ME in bij het gemeentehuis toen er nog zo'n honderd demonstranten waren. Eerder op de avond waren er ongeveer driehonderd demonstranten aanwezig. Vlakbij hielden zo'n dertig voorstanders van het azc een tegendemonstratie. De ME werd ingezet om die twee groepen uit elkaar te halen. Een deel van de anti-azc-demonstranten gooide vuurwerk en eieren naar de tegendemonstratie en de politie. Ook werd met stenen gegooid, zag een ANP-verslaggever. De wijk in In Uithoorn waren ook een paar honderd betogers. Ook daar stonden ze bij het gemeentehuis, omdat daar een vergadering over asielopvang was. Na een tijdje werd de sfeer grimmig. Demonstranten trokken een woonwijk in, en de ME achtervolgde ze, zag een ANP-verslaggever. De politie verrichtte meerdere arrestaties. Op het plein gooiden anti-azc-demonstranten met vuurwerk en eieren naar een klein groepje tegendemonstranten. Ook naar de politie werd met vuurwerk gegooid. De burgemeester van Uithoorn betreurt dat de demonstratie in zijn gemeente is uitgelopen op ongeregeldheden. Hij zegt dat de gemeente zich niet laat meeslepen door de luidste of felste stemmen. 'Vluchtelingen welkom, nazi's niet', stond op een de borden van de mensen die voor een azc zijn: In Uithoorn staat een opvang van ongeveer 250 mensen gepland, meldt NH Nieuws. Daar kan nog bezwaar tegen worden ingediend. Ook demonstreerde de groep tegen een azc in buurgemeente Amstelveen. In Houten zijn er plannen voor een azc voor 337 mensen op een bedrijventerrein aan de rand van de gemeente. Ook daar is nog geen definitief besluit over genomen. Rustig in Urk Ook in Urk is vanavond een raadsvergadering over de komst van een azc, maar daar is het rustig. De politie laat weten dat er wel wat demonstranten buiten staan en dat de situatie na gisteren scherp in de gaten wordt gehouden. Gisteren waren er in Urk ongeregeldheden toen tientallen jongeren bij elkaar kwamen, meldt regionaal dagblad De Noordoostpolder.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586485","published_date":"2025-10-14T20:32:41","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:50:57.247568","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":381,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3020,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mobiele Eenheid","NSB","Demonstraties voor en tegen azc's in"],"persons":[],"locations":["Uithoorn"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2376,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Demonstraties","azcs","zijn demonstraties","de komst","een azc","ongeregeldheden","beide protesten","mensen","ieder geval","aanhoudingen"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Demonstraties":2.0,"azcs":2.0,"zijn demonstraties":1.0,"de komst":1.0,"een azc":1.0,"ongeregeldheden":1.0,"beide protesten":1.0,"mensen":1.0,"ieder geval":1.0,"aanhoudingen":1.0}},"age_hours":5.472317794166666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0424999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0085,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1823,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0213,"sadness":0.0165,"fear":0.0567,"anger":0.6068,"disgust":0.1094},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes demonstrations related to planned asylum centers (azc) in Houten and Uithoorn.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_73a442fd4af0","title":"IMF: gevolgen handelsoorlog vallen tot nu toe mee, maar onzekerheid blijft","content":"De wereldeconomie lijkt tot dusver niet al te hard geraakt te worden door de handelsoorlog. Toch zijn de daadwerkelijke gevolgen nog niet te overzien en blijft onzekerheid op termijn overheersen. Dat meldt het Internationaal Monetair Fonds in zijn nieuwe groeivoorspelling. Voor de tweede keer op rij wordt de wereldgroei voor dit jaar licht naar boven bijgesteld - met een extra 0,1 procent naar 3,2 procent. Het hielp dat de hoge aangekondigde heffingen van de Amerikaanse president Trump in veel gevallen zijn verlaagd door handelsakkoorden, ook al zijn details hiervan nog niet altijd even duidelijk. Ook de Europese Unie sloot zo'n akkoord met de VS. Ook de flexibiliteit van de private sector droeg bij aan de gematigde gevolgen, zegt IMF-hoofdeconoom Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. De sector haalde import naar voren en was snel in het verleggen van toeleveringsketens. Blijvende onzekerheid Toch blijft de onzekerheid over de stabiliteit en de koers van de wereldeconomie kritiek, benadrukt het IMF. \"Landen, instellingen en markten hebben zich aangepast aan een landschap dat gekenmerkt wordt door toenemend protectionisme en fragmentatie\", aldus het IMF. Dit gaat volgens de organisatie gepaard met sombere groeivooruitzichten en op een gegeven moment ook de roep om verandering van het macro-economische beleid van landen. De gevolgen van Trumps heffingen zijn ook verder nog niet helemaal te overzien, zegt Gourinchas. \"De gevolgen van deze spanningen kunnen toenemen wanneer bedrijven de heffingen gaan doorberekenen aan klanten en handelsroutes permanent via andere landen worden gelegd. Dan wordt de wereldeconomie langzaamaan minder efficiënt.\" Ook benadrukt het IMF de gevolgen van strenger migratiebeleid. Dit zorgt er bijvoorbeeld in de Verenigde Staten voor dat er minder arbeiders het land inkomen, wat slecht kan zijn voor de productieketen. Op dit moment daalt ook de vraag naar arbeid, waardoor het nog niet zo'n probleem is.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586478","published_date":"2025-10-14T19:01:14","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:50:57.248459","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":293,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2333,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.465,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IMF"],"persons":["Trump","Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas"],"locations":["Europese Unie"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1945,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["onzekerheid","gevolgen","De wereldeconomie","de handelsoorlog","de daadwerkelijke gevolgen","termijn","zijn nieuwe groeivoorspelling","de tweede keer","rij","de wereldgroei"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"onzekerheid":3.0,"gevolgen":2.0,"De wereldeconomie":1.0,"de handelsoorlog":1.0,"de daadwerkelijke gevolgen":1.0,"termijn":1.0,"zijn nieuwe groeivoorspelling":1.0,"de tweede keer":1.0,"rij":1.0,"de wereldgroei":1.0}},"age_hours":6.9964996105555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7163,"joy":0.0209,"surprise":0.1254,"sadness":0.0323,"fear":0.0359,"anger":0.0344,"disgust":0.0349},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"scaling","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the impact of trade wars on the global economy, noting a slight upward adjustment in world growth (0.1% to 3.2%).

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_3bfd9c0be0b9","title":"Oekraïne kreeg deze zomer fors minder wapens en munitie dan voorheen","content":"In juli en augustus heeft Oekraïne fors minder militaire hulp gehad van bondgenoten dan eerder dit jaar. Het gaat volgens onderzoekers om 43 procent minder wapens, munitie en ander legermaterieel in vergelijking met de eerste zes maanden van het jaar. Het Duitse onderzoeksbureau Kiel Institute noemt het een verrassende ontwikkeling waar het geen verklaring voor heeft. \"Europa schaalt zijn totale militaire steun af\", zegt hoofdonderzoeker Christoph Trebesch van de Ukraine Support Tracker. \"Het wordt cruciaal hoe deze cijfers zich in de herfst ontwikkelen.\" Effect onduidelijk Het is nog te vroeg om te spreken van een trend. Ook valt nog niet te zeggen of Oekraïne iets van de recente daling zal merken op het slagveld. Het land leunt sowieso al meer op zijn eigen oorlogsindustrie, bijvoorbeeld voor de productie van drones en raketten. Onder meer voor luchtafweer is Kyiv nog wel afhankelijk van bondgenoten. In juli en augustus werd vanuit het buitenland gemiddeld per maand voor ruim 2 miljard euro aan militaire middelen geleverd en toegezegd. De zes maanden ervoor was dat bijna 4 miljard per maand. Ter vergelijking: in de eerste jaren van de oorlog werd er maandelijks gemiddeld zo'n 3,5 miljard euro aan wapens en materieel geleverd en toegezegd. Over de Ukraine Support Tracker Het Kiel Institute houdt sinds het begin van de Russische invasie van 2022 bij welke steun landen hebben toegezegd of geleverd. De cijfers zijn niet compleet en alleen gebaseerd op informatie die landen willen vrijgeven. Toch wordt de database beschouwd als het gedetailleerdste overzicht van militaire leveringen aan Oekraïne. Sinds het aantreden van Trump geeft de VS vrijwel niets meer aan Oekraïne. In de eerste helft van 2025 waren Europese bondgenoten in dat gat gesprongen, zo bleek eerder uit cijfers van de Duitse onderzoekers. Nieuw systeem voor aanschaf wapens uit VS In juli is een nieuw mechanisme ingevoerd voor NAVO-landen die wapens in de VS willen kopen voor Oekraïne: de Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL). Dat is simpel gezegd een lijst waarop Oekraïne aangeeft welke luchtverdediging, munitie en andere zaken het hardst nodig zijn. Via PURL hebben zeker acht landen, waaronder Nederland, inmiddels wapens gekocht voor Kyiv. Afgaand op de totaalcijfers van militaire hulp over de twee zomermaanden, is het mechanisme niet populair onder NAVO-lidstaten. Overigens is het niveau van financiële hulp aan Oekraïne wel stabiel gebleken. In juli en augustus werd gemiddeld evenveel geldsteun gegeven als in de overige maanden van de ruim 3,5 jaar durende oorlog. Amerikaanse Tomahawk-raketten voor Oekraïne? Vrijdag is president Zelensky weer op bezoek in het Witte Huis. Trump heeft onlangs de suggestie gewekt dat de VS Tomahawk-raketten wil leveren aan Oekraïne. Met deze raketten kan het Oekraïense leger doelwitten diep in Rusland raken. Aan het begin zijn presidentschap was Trump nog uitermate lovend over president Poetin. Hij heeft de Russische president in augustus ontvangen in Alaska. De Amerikaanse leider was aanvankelijk zeer positief over het vooruitzicht op vrede tussen Oekraïne en Rusland, maar daar is in de praktijk niets van terechtgekomen. Trump heeft sindsdien herhaaldelijk kritiek geuit op Poetin, zonder dat dit tot veel praktische consequenties leidde. Rusland rukt beperkt op Ondertussen wordt in het zuiden en oosten van Oekraïne nog altijd hard gevochten. Rusland heeft de afgelopen maanden ten koste van zware verliezen meer gebied veroverd, maar gemeten aan de enorme schaal van Oekraïne blijft het toch nog zeer beperkt. Grote doorbraken zijn er dit jaar niet geweest. Rusland voert dagelijks zware luchtaanvallen uit op Oekraïense steden. Over schade aan militaire installaties maakt Oekraïne niets bekend, maar duidelijk is dat civiele infrastructuur op grote schaal wordt getroffen. Op zijn beurt voert Oekraïne drone en raketaanvallen uit op olieraffinaderijen in Rusland.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586476","published_date":"2025-10-14T18:53:06","collected_date":"2025-10-15T01:50:57.251263","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":602,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4472,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Kiel Institute","Ukraine Support"],"persons":["Christoph Trebesch"],"locations":["Europa","Oekraïne","bondgenoten"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3926,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["minder wapens","munitie","deze zomer","minder militaire hulp","bondgenoten","eerder dit jaar","Het","onderzoekers","procent","ander legermaterieel"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["minder militaire hulp"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"minder wapens":3.0,"munitie":3.0,"deze zomer":2.0,"minder militaire hulp":1.0,"bondgenoten":1.0,"eerder dit jaar":1.0,"Het":1.0,"onderzoekers":1.0,"procent":1.0,"ander legermaterieel":1.0}},"age_hours":7.132070758888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5033,"joy":0.0151,"surprise":0.0608,"sadness":0.0427,"fear":0.2007,"anger":0.1001,"disgust":0.0771},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"scaling","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reports on a decrease in military aid to Ukraine, specifically a 43% reduction in weapons and ammunition.
