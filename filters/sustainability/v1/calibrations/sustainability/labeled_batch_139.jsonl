{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_694d2884a81e","title":"Secret","content":"arXiv:2510.10990v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable on large language models (LLMs) and even lead to general artificial intelligence (AGI). A lot of high-quality text in the real world is private and cannot be freely used due to privacy concerns. Therefore, differentially private (DP) synthetic text generation has been proposed, aiming to produce high-utility synthetic data while protecting sensitive information. However, existing DP synthetic text generation imposes uniform guarantees that often overprotect non-sensitive content, resulting in substantial utility loss and computational overhead. Therefore, we propose Secret-Protected Evolution (SecPE), a novel framework that extends private evolution with secret-aware protection. Theoretically, we show that SecPE satisfies $(\\mathrm{p}, \\mathrm{r})$-secret protection, constituting a relaxation of Gaussian DP that enables tighter utility-privacy trade-offs, while also substantially reducing computational complexity relative to baseline methods. Empirically, across the OpenReview, PubMed, and Yelp benchmarks, SecPE consistently achieves lower Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and higher downstream task accuracy than GDP-based Aug-PE baselines, while requiring less noise to attain the same level of protection. Our results highlight that secret-aware guarantees can unlock more practical and effective privacy-preserving synthetic text generation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10990","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.849581","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","cscr","cscl","csne","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Tianze Wang, Zhaoyu Chen, Jian Du, Yingtai Xiao, Linjun Zhang, Qiang Yan","raw_content_length":1452,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AGI","SecPE","Secret-Protected Evolution"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1451,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","new Abstract","Text data","large language models","LLMs","general artificial intelligence","AGI","A lot","high-quality text","the real world"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models","general artificial intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Text data":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"general artificial intelligence":1.0,"AGI":1.0,"A lot":1.0,"high-quality text":1.0,"the real world":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7555098425,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1165,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6233,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8988,"joy":0.0168,"surprise":0.032,"sadness":0.0103,"fear":0.0115,"anger":0.0198,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework (SecPE) for differentially private synthetic text generation.

We call this the \\textit{piecewise linear perturbation of the doubling map} (PLPDM) and it is given by the formula, $f_{a,b}(x)= \\displaystyle \\bigl(2x+a+\\dfrac{b}{2} S(x) \\bigr) // 1 \\quad {\\text {for }} x, a, b \\in [0,1] $, where $y // 1$ means $y \\mod 1$ (or simply, the fractional part of $y$) and $S(x)$ is the piecewise linear approximation of $\\sin 2\\pi(x-1/4)$.

Conversely, however, a Feynman propagator determines a state only if certain positivity conditions are fulfilled. We point out that the construction of a state from a Feynman propagator involves a slightly subtle point that we address and resolve. Starting from a recent generalisation of the Duistermaat-H\\\"ormander theory of distinguished parametrices to normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators acting on sections of hermitian vector bundles, we complete this work by showing how Feynman propagators can be chosen so as to define Hadamard states. The theories considered are: the complex bosonic field governed by a normally hyperbolic operator; the corresponding hermitian theory if the operator commutes with a complex conjugation; the Dirac fermionic theory governed by a Dirac-type operator, and the corresponding Majorana theory in the case where the operator commutes with a skew complex conjugation. The additional key ingredients that we supply are simple domination properties of self-adjoint smooth kernels.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11492","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.322794","language":"en","tags":["preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Christopher J.

We demonstrate that the coefficients $q_1$ and $q_2$, as well as the source term $F$, can be recovered up to a natural gauge symmetry inherent in the problem from local measurements. Furthermore, if $q_1$ is known, we establish the unique recovery of the source $F$, which is in a striking contrast to inverse source problems for linear equations where unique recovery is not possible. Our results also generalize previous works by eliminating the assumption that $u= 0$ is a solution, and by accommodating quadratic nonlinearities. A key contribution is the development of a calculus for nonlinear interactions of Gaussian beams. This framework provides an explicit representation for waves that correspond to sources involving products of two or more Gaussian beams. We anticipate this calculus will serve as a versatile tool in related problems, offering a concrete alternative to Fourier integral operator methods.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11494","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.324010","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Matti Lassas, Tony Liimatainen, Valter Pohjola, Teemu Tyni","raw_content_length":1121,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$q_2$","$q_1$"]},"char_count":1118,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gaussian beam interactions","inverse source problems","nonlinear wave equations","q_2","q_1","arXiv251011494v1","new Abstract","the inverse source problem","the semilinear wave equation","u2 F"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gaussian beam interactions":2.0,"inverse source problems":2.0,"nonlinear wave equations":2.0,"q_2":2.0,"q_1":2.0,"arXiv251011494v1":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the inverse source problem":1.0,"the semilinear wave equation":1.0,"u2 F":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7868454672222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.2885,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5423,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8351,"joy":0.0664,"surprise":0.0669,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0155,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical mathematical advancements related to inverse source problems in nonlinear wave equations.

We introduce three novel outer approximations of the feasible region, systematically constructed from a BB tree. These are: a tight formulation based on disjunctive programming, a branching-based formulation derived from the tree's branching logic, and a mixing-set formulation derived from the on-off properties inside the tree. We establish an inclusion hierarchy, which ranks the approximations by their theoretical strength \\wrt to the original feasible region. The analysis is extended to the generation of valid inequalities, revealing a separation-time hierarchy that mirrors the inclusion hierarchy in reverse. This highlights a trade-off between the tightness of an approximation and the computational cost of generating cuts from it. Motivated by the computational expense of the stronger approximations, we introduce a new family of valid inequalities called star tree inequalities. Although their closure forms the weakest of the proposed approximations, their practical appeal lies in an efficient, polynomial-time combinatorial separation algorithm. A computational study on multi-dimensional knapsack and set-covering problems empirically validates the theoretical findings. Moreover, these experiments confirm that computationally useful valid inequalities can be generated from BB trees obtained by solving optimization problems considered in practice.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11497","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.324678","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Marius Roland, Nagisa Sugishita, Alexandre Forel, Youssouf Emine, Ricardo Fukasawa, Thibaut Vidal","raw_content_length":1592,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear","The Branch arXiv:2510.11497v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1591,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Branch","the feasible region","arXiv251011497v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","the a-posteriori analysis","Branch-and-BoundBB trees","structural information","mixed-binary linear programs"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Branch":2.0,"the feasible region":2.0,"arXiv251011497v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the a-posteriori analysis":1.0,"Branch-and-BoundBB trees":1.0,"structural information":1.0,"mixed-binary linear programs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.786859608611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9183,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0236,"sadness":0.003,"fear":0.0118,"anger":0.0165,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents novel outer approximations of feasible regions in mixed-binary linear programs, potentially leading to more efficient optimization.

This structural property enables us to integrate powerful combinatorial optimization tools into a gradient-based minimax algorithmic framework. For the robust linear least squares problem with the supermodularity, we establish the relationship between the minimax points of BRLS and saddle points of its continuous relaxation, and propose a projected gradient algorithm computing $\\epsilon$-global minimax points in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. For the robust nonlinear least squares problem with supermodularity, we develop a revised framework that finds $\\epsilon$-stationary points in the sense of expectation within $O(\\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations. For the robust linear least squares problem with the submodularity, we employ a double greedy algorithm as a subsolver, guaranteeing a $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\epsilon)$-approximate minimax point in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations.

This paper unifies and extends many previous optimization-based approaches to constrained confidence region construction in linear inverse problems through the lens of statistical test inversion. We begin by reviewing the historical development of optimization-based confidence intervals for the single-functional setting, from \"strict bounds\" to the Burrus conjecture and its recent refutation via the aforementioned test inversion framework. We then extend this framework to the multiple-functional setting. This framework can be used to: (i) improve the calibration constants of previous methods, yielding smaller confidence regions that still preserve frequentist coverage, (ii) obtain tractable multidimensional confidence regions that need not be hyper-rectangles to better capture functional dependence structure, and (iii) generalize beyond Gaussian error distributions to generic log-concave error distributions.

The setting involves a finitely generated abelian group $ \\mathtt{G}$ of rank $b$ acting on $M$ by isometries in a free, totally discontinuous, and co-compact manner, and a family of Hamiltonians $H: T^*M \\times \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$, parametrized over a probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathbb{P})$, which are stationary with respect to a $\\mathbb{P}$-ergodic action of $\\mathtt{G}$ on $\\Omega$. Under standard assumptions, including strict convexity and coercivity in the momentum variable, we prove that as the scaling parameter $\\varepsilon$ goes to $0$, the viscosity solutions to the rescaled equation converge almost surely and locally uniformly to the solution to a deterministic homogenized Hamilton-Jacobi equation posed on $\\mathbb{R}^b$, which corresponds to the asymptotic cone of $\\mathtt{G}$. In particular, this approach sheds light on the relation between the limit problem, the limit space, and the complexity of the acting group. The classical periodic case corresponds to a randomness set $\\Omega$ that reduces to a singleton; other interesting examples of this setting are also described. We remark that the effective Hamiltonian $\\overline{H}$ is obtained as the convex conjugate of an effective Lagrangian $\\overline{L}$, which generalizes Mather's $\\beta$-function to the stochastic setting; this represents a first step towards the development of a stationary-ergodic version of Aubry-Mather theory.

However, existing results are confined to two-step bounds, failing to provide a sharper characterization of the meta-generalization gap that simultaneously accounts for environment-level and task-level dependencies. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by developing a unified information-theoretic framework using a single-step derivation. The resulting meta-generalization bounds, expressed in terms of diverse information measures, exhibit substantial advantages over previous work, particularly in terms of tightness, scaling behavior associated with sampled tasks and samples per task, and computational tractability. Furthermore, through gradient covariance analysis, we provide new theoretical insights into the generalization properties of two classes of noisy and iterative meta-learning algorithms, where the meta-learner uses either the entire meta-training data (e.g., Reptile), or separate training and test data within the task (e.g., model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)).

However, accurate in situ characterization of large-scale quantum devices remains a formidable challenge: such systems experience many different sources of errors, and cannot be simulated on classical computers. Here, we introduce new benchmarking methods based on random circuit sampling (RCS), that substantially extend the scope of conventional approaches. Unlike existing benchmarks that report only a single quantity--the circuit fidelity--our framework extracts rich diagnostic information, including spatiotemporal error profiles, correlated and contextual errors, and biased readout errors, without requiring any modifications of the experiment. Furthermore, we develop techniques that achieve this task without classically intractable simulations of the quantum circuit, by leveraging side information, in the form of bitstring samples obtained from reference quantum devices. Our approach is based on advanced high-dimensional statistical modeling of RCS data. We sharply characterize the information-theoretic limits of error estimation, deriving matching upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity across all regimes of side information. We identify surprising phase transitions in learnability as the amount of side information varies.

We focus on conformal general relativity with a Weyl form-invariant matter action. In this case, a linear dependence of the variations of the metric and of the Brans-Dicke scalar field arises, which is a direct consequence of invariance under infinitesimal Weyl rescalings. We demonstrate how to apply the variational procedure properly and obtain the correct equations of motion. It results that the Klein-Gordon type equation for the Brans-Dicke scalar coincides with the trace of the Einstein-type equation of motion. In consequence, any matter fields, no matter whether the trace of their stress-energy tensor vanishes or not, can be coupled to gravity.

Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10259","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.354455","language":"en","tags":["mathds","q-biope","nlinao","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Yishen Jiang, Xin Wang, Wenqiang Zhu, Ming Wei, Longzhao Liu, Shaoting Tang, Hongwei Zheng","raw_content_length":1351,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PGG","Nonlinear Public Goods Game"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1350,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nonlinear Public Goods Game","Dynamical Environments","cooperative behavior","arXiv251010259v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","The evolutionary mechanisms","a fundamental topic","complex systems","evolutionary dynamics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nonlinear Public Goods Game":2.0,"Dynamical Environments":2.0,"cooperative behavior":2.0,"arXiv251010259v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The evolutionary mechanisms":1.0,"a fundamental topic":1.0,"complex systems":1.0,"evolutionary dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7877151033333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8693,"joy":0.0375,"surprise":0.0595,"sadness":0.0088,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0129,"disgust":0.0055},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the dynamics of cooperation in public goods games under dynamic environmental conditions.

It is shown that this function can be approximated by one with a continued fraction expansion resembling that associated with a class of microstructure known as sequential laminates. These are hierarchical microstructures defined inductively. Rank 0 sequential laminates are simply rotations of the pure crystal. Rank $j$ sequential laminates are obtained by laminating together, on a length scale much larger that the existing microstructure and with interfaces perpendicular to some direction $n_j$, rank $j-1$ sequential laminates with a rotation of the pure crystal. The continued fraction approximation for arbitrary polycrystal microstructures typically takes a more general form than that of sequential laminates, but has some free parameters. It is an open question as to whether these free parameters can always be adjusted so the continued fraction approximation matches exactly that of a sequential laminate. If so, one would have established that the elastic response of two-dimensional polycrystals can always be mimicked by that of sequential laminates. Our analysis carries over to the more general case where the strain is replaced by a field $E(x)$ that is the gradient of a vector potential $u(x)$, i.e. $E=\\nabla u$ and the stress is replaced by a matrix valued field $J(x)$ that need not be symmetric but has zero divergence $\\nabla\\cdot J=0$. The tensor $L(x)$ entering the constitutive relation $J=L E$ is locally a rotation of the tensor $L_0$ of the pure crystal that need not have any special symmetries and has 16 independent tensor elements.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10297","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.354903","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","math-ph","mathmp","research","mathematics","cond-matmtrl-sci","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":270,"author":"Graeme W.

Using a dynamic programming approach, we derive closed-form solutions for the value function and the optimal consumption, portfolio, and labor supply strategies. Our results show that before retirement, investment behavior increases with wealth until a threshold set by labor supply. After retirement, agents tend to consume a larger portion of their wealth. Two main factors influence optimal annuitization decisions as people get older. First, the agent's perspective (demand side); the agent's personal discount rate rises with age, reducing their desire to annuitize. Second, the insurer's perspective (supply side); insurers offer higher payout rates (mortality credits). Our model demonstrates that beyond a certain age, sharply declining survival probabilities make annuitization substantially optimal, as the powerful incentive of mortality credits outweighs the agent's high personal discount rate. Finally, post-retirement labor income serves as a direct substitute for annuitization by providing an alternative stable income source. It enhances the financial security of retirees.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10371","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.356512","language":"en","tags":["q-finpm","preprints","mathoc","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Criscent Birungi, Cody Hyndman","raw_content_length":1326,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1325,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimal annuitization","labor income","age","labour income","arXiv251010371v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","the problem","optimal annuitization","an agent"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["age"],"hydrogen_energy":["age"],"renewable_energy":["age"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimal annuitization":2.0,"labor income":2.0,"age":2.0,"labour income":2.0,"arXiv251010371v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"optimal annuitization":1.0,"an agent":1.0}},"age_hours":2.787786796388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.2955,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8591,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8909,"joy":0.0313,"surprise":0.0321,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.0094,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical model for optimal annuitization strategies.

In this work, we develop an alternative GCM framework, that we call mass-centered, designed to overcome the breakdown of the standard GCM construction in the charged case, where electromagnetic-gravitational coupling destroys the exceptional behavior of the $\\ell=1$ mode of the center-of-mass quantity used in the vacuum analysis. This construction is aimed at the nonlinear stability of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om and Kerr-Newman spacetimes. Our approach replaces transport-based control of the center-of-mass quantity with a sphere-wise vanishing condition on a renormalized $\\ell=1$ mode, yielding mass-centered GCM hypersurfaces with modified gauge constraints. The resulting elliptic-transport system remains determined once an $\\ell=1$ basis is fixed via effective uniformization and provides an alternative construction in vacuum in the uncharged limit.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10811","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.361714","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","gr-qc","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Allen Juntao Fang, Elena Giorgi, Jingbo Wan","raw_content_length":1236,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Kerr-Newman","GCM","Kerr"],"persons":["Reissner","Einstein"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\ell=1$"]},"char_count":1235,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mass","Announce Type","cross","The nonlinear stability problem","black hole solutions","the Einstein equations","an appropriate geometric gauge","the vacuum setting","the use","Generally Covariant Modulated GCM spheres"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mass":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"The nonlinear stability problem":1.0,"black hole solutions":1.0,"the Einstein equations":1.0,"an appropriate geometric gauge":1.0,"the vacuum setting":1.0,"the use":1.0,"Generally Covariant Modulated GCM spheres":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7879611575,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.872,"joy":0.0256,"surprise":0.0732,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.0084,"anger":0.0114,"disgust":0.0031},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research in mathematical physics concerning the stability of black holes.

The procedure is based on replacing the obsolete census file with a larger unit-level survey that adequately covers the areas of interest and contains the values of useful auxiliary variables. However, the minimal data requirement of the proposed method is a single survey with microdata on the target variable and suitable auxiliary variables for the period of interest. We also develop an estimator of the mean squared error (MSE) that accounts for the uncertainty introduced by the large survey used to replace the census of auxiliary information. Our empirical results indicate that the proposed predictors perform clearly better than the alternative predictors when census data are outdated, and are very close to optimal ones when census data are correct. They also illustrate that the proposed total MSE estimator corrects for the bias of purely model-based MSE estimators that do not account for the large survey uncertainty.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10812","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.362108","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statme","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"William Acero, Isabel Molina, J.

In the vacuum case, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and hypersurfaces has been successful in the proof of stability for slowly rotating Kerr spacetime. For the charged setting, our companion paper introduced an alternative mass-centered GCM framework, adapted to the additional difficulties of the Einstein-Maxwell system. In this work, we solve the Einstein-Maxwell equations on such a mass-centered spacelike GCM hypersurface, which is equivalent to solving the constraint equations there. We control all geometric quantities of the solution in terms of some seed data, corresponding to the gauge-invariant fields describing coupled gravitational-electromagnetic radiation in perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om or Kerr-Newman, first identified by the second author and expected to be governed by favorable hyperbolic equations. This provides the first step toward controlling gauge-dependent quantities in the nonlinear stability analysis of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om and Kerr-Newman families.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10814","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.362525","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathap","gr-qc","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Allen Juntao Fang, Elena Giorgi, Jingbo Wan","raw_content_length":1236,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.83,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Kerr-Newman","GCM","Kerr"],"persons":["Reissner","Einstein","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1233,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Einstein","arXiv251010814v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","The resolution","the nonlinear stability","black holes","solutions","the Einstein equations","the right geometric gauge conditions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Einstein":2.0,"arXiv251010814v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The resolution":1.0,"the nonlinear stability":1.0,"black holes":1.0,"solutions":1.0,"the Einstein equations":1.0,"the right geometric gauge conditions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7879903236111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.553000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5106,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.708,"joy":0.147,"surprise":0.1193,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.0049,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.0029},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical physics, specifically the stability of black holes.

By default, this framework requires continuous control input to offset deviations from the desired state, which can be invasive and cost a considerable amount of energy. Here, we introduce tempological (temporal + topological) control -- a novel, noninvasive strategy that harnesses the inherent flexibility of time-varying networks to control the dynamics of a general nonlinear system. By strategically switching network topology on-the-fly based on the current states of the nodes, we show how it is possible to drive a system to a desired state or even stabilize otherwise unstable states, all in the absence of external forcing. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using networks of Kuramoto and Stuart-Landau oscillators, achieving synchronization out of sets of unsynchronizable networks. Finally, we develop a statistical theory that explains why tempological control will almost always succeed in the limit of large and diverse temporal networks, with diversity of network configurations overcoming the deficiencies of any snapshot in isolation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10926","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.364354","language":"en","tags":["mathds","nlinao","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Yuanzhao Zhang, Sean P.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_eb842967c28f","title":"Spatial and Temporal Boundaries in Difference-in","content":"arXiv:2510.11013v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for identifying spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects in difference-in-differences designs. Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11013","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.365637","language":"en","tags":["econem","mathst","q-finec","statap","preprints","statme","econgn","statth","research","mathematics"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Tatsuru Kikuchi","raw_content_length":1861,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Reynolds","Temporal Boundaries","Navier-Stokes"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["Western United States"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1860,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Temporal Boundaries","Difference","treatment effects","which","arXiv251011013v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This paper","a unified framework","spatial and temporal boundaries"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Temporal Boundaries":2.0,"Difference":2.0,"treatment effects":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv251011013v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a unified framework":1.0,"spatial and temporal boundaries":1.0}},"age_hours":2.788087299166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8346,"joy":0.0351,"surprise":0.0822,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.018,"anger":0.0179,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper develops a framework to identify spatial and temporal boundaries of treatment effects using fluid dynamics equations.

The specializations at roots of unity of either forms are the \"MpQG's at roots of unity\" we look for. In particular, we study special subalgebras and quotients of our MpQG's at roots of unity - namely, the multiparameter version of small quantum groups - and suitable associated quantum Frobenius morphisms, that link the MpQG's at roots of 1 with MpQG's at 1, the latter being classical Hopf algebras bearing a well precise Poisson-geometrical content. A key point in the discussion - often at the core of our strategy - is that every MpQG is actually a 2-cocycle deformation of the algebra structure of (a lift of) the \"canonical\" one-parameter quantum group by Jimbo-Lusztig, so that we can often rely on already established results available for the latter. On the other hand, depending on the chosen multiparameter $ \\boldsymbol{\\rm q} $ our quantum groups yield (through the choice of integral forms and their specialization) different semiclassical structures, namely different Lie coalgebra structures and Poisson structures on the Lie algebra and algebraic group underlying the canonical one-parameter quantum group.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05760","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.373583","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathqa","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Gast\\'on Andr\\'es Garc\\'ia, Fabio Gavarini","raw_content_length":1778,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MpQG"],"persons":["Frobenius"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\boldsymbol{\\rm"]},"char_count":1777,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["roots","unity","Multiparameter quantum groups"," U_boldsymbolrm","arXiv170805760v5 Announce Type","Abstract","the study","multiparameter quamtum groups","MpQG","universal enveloping"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["the study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"roots":3.0,"unity":3.0,"Multiparameter quantum groups":2.0," U_boldsymbolrm":2.0,"arXiv170805760v5 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the study":1.0,"multiparameter quamtum groups":1.0,"MpQG":1.0,"universal enveloping":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7883551591666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8994,"joy":0.0266,"surprise":0.0337,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0116,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is theoretical mathematics research.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_8eb92f282f43","title":"Cutoff for Almost All Random Walks on Abelian Groups","content":"arXiv:2102.02809v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Consider the random Cayley graph of a finite group $G$ with respect to $k$ generators chosen uniformly at random, with $1 \\ll \\log k \\ll \\log |G|$; denote it $G_k$. A conjecture of Aldous and Diaconis (1985) asserts, for $k \\gg \\log |G|$, that the random walk on this graph exhibits cutoff. Further, the cutoff time should be a function only of $k$ and $|G|$, to sub-leading order. This was verified for all Abelian groups in the '90s. We extend the conjecture to $1 \\ll k \\lesssim \\log |G|$. We establish cutoff for all Abelian groups under the condition $k - d(G) \\gg 1$, where $d(G)$ is the minimal size of a generating subset of $G$, which is almost optimal. The cutoff time is described (abstractly) in terms of the entropy of random walk on $\\mathbb Z^k$. This abstract definition allows us to deduce that the cutoff time can be written as a function only of $k$ and $|G|$ when $d(G) \\ll \\log |G|$ and $k - d(G) \\asymp k \\gg 1$; this is not the case when $d(G) \\asymp \\log |G| \\asymp k$. For certain regimes of $k$, we find the limit profile of the convergence to equilibrium. Wilson (1997) conjectured that $\\mathbb Z_2^d$ gives rise to the slowest mixing time for $G_k$ amongst all groups of size at most $2^d$. We give a partial answer, verifying the conjecture for nilpotent groups. This is obtained via a comparison result of independent interest between the mixing times of nilpotent $G$ and a corresponding Abelian group $\\overline G$, namely the direct sum of the Abelian quotients in the lower central series of $G$. We use this to refine a celebrated result of Alon and Roichman (1994): we show for nilpotent $G$ that $G_k$ is an expander provided $k - d(\\overline G) \\gtrsim \\log |G|$. As another consequence, we establish cutoff for nilpotent groups with relatively small commutators, including high-dimensional special groups, such as Heisenberg groups.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02809","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.376636","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","preprints","research","mathematics","mathgr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":329,"author":"Jonathan Hermon, Sam Olesker-Taylor","raw_content_length":1925,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.645,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Almost All Random Walks","Aldous and Diaconis"],"persons":["G_k$.","Cutoff","d(G","\\ll \\","k \\ll \\log"],"locations":["Cayley"],"monetary":["$k$","\\mathbb","|G|$"]},"char_count":1924,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cutoff","Almost All Random Walks","Abelian Groups","arXiv210202809v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the random Cayley graph","a finite group","respect","k generators","G_k"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cutoff":2.0,"Almost All Random Walks":2.0,"Abelian Groups":2.0,"arXiv210202809v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the random Cayley graph":1.0,"a finite group":1.0,"respect":1.0,"k generators":1.0,"G_k":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7884606269444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9142,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0449,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0049,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0091},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on random walks on Abelian groups.

Measuring the closeness between two distributions with the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence, the closest distribution is called the \"information projection.\" The estimation risk of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is defined as the expectation of K-L divergence between the information projection and the predictive distribution with plugged-in MLE. Here, the asymptotic expansion of the risk is derived up to $n^{-2}$-order, and the sufficient condition on the risk for the Bayes error rate between the true distribution and the information projection to be lower than a specified value is investigated. Combining these results, the \"$p-n$ criterion\" is proposed, which determines whether the MLE is sufficiently close to the information projection for the given model and sample. In particular, the criterion for an exponential family model is relatively simple and can be used for a complex model with no explicit form of normalizing constant. This criterion can constitute a solution to the sample size or model acceptance problem. Use of the $p-n$ criteria is demonstrated for two practical datasets. The relationship between the results and information criteria is also studied.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08947","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.377034","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Yo Sheena","raw_content_length":1389,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Kullback-Leibler","K-L","Bayes","MLE"],"persons":["version-- arXiv:2105.08947v5 Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":["up to $n^{-2}$-order"]},"char_count":1388,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MLE convergence speed","information projection","exponential family","Criterion","model dimension","sample size","complete proof version--","the closest distribution","the model","the information projection"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MLE convergence speed"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MLE convergence speed":2.0,"information projection":2.0,"exponential family":2.0,"Criterion":2.0,"model dimension":2.0,"sample size":2.0,"complete proof version--":2.0,"the closest distribution":2.0,"the model":2.0,"the information projection":2.0}},"age_hours":2.7884762747222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8099,"joy":0.0488,"surprise":0.1183,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0092,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical criterion for model dimension and sample size in statistical modeling, potentially applicable to climate models.

This paper explores this topic in the design of transit networks by considering the perspectives of both the transit agencies and riders. The paper presents a generic bilevel optimization model, namely the Transit Networks Design with Adoptions (TN-DA), that considers the network design decisions in the leader problem, and routing of the riders in the follower problem under the given network design, while allowing a black-box choice function for representing the adoption behavior of latent demand. The paper then identifies structural properties of the optimal solution of the TN-DA problem, which are desirable for transit agencies for capturing adoption behavior of the riders. The paper further provides guideline metrics for the transit agencies based on these desired adoption properties. Due to the computational complexity of this bilevel problem, the paper proposes five efficient heuristic algorithms to solve large-scale instances, which leverage an iterative procedure by solving a simpler version of the TN-DA problem and integrating the evaluation of rider choices. These algorithms either satisfy the desired properties of the optimal solution or provide fast approximations. The paper presents extensive large-scale case studies on two different transit systems by utilizing real datasets: (i) On-demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS) and (ii) Scooters-Connected Transit Systems (SCTS). The results demonstrate that the heuristic algorithms can find high-quality solutions much faster than exact approaches over various instances, while satisfying key adoption properties of the optimal solutions.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03460","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.382966","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":261,"author":"Hongzhao Guan, Beste Basciftci, Pascal Van Hentenryck","raw_content_length":1833,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.305,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Design of Large arXiv:2212.03460v2 Announce Type:","the Transit Networks Design with Adoptions"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1832,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bilevel Optimization","Heuristic Algorithms","Integrating Latent Demand","the Design","arXiv221203460v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Capturing latent demand","a pivotal role","transit services","these riders"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Heuristic Algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bilevel Optimization":2.0,"Heuristic Algorithms":2.0,"Integrating Latent Demand":2.0,"the Design":2.0,"arXiv221203460v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Capturing latent demand":1.0,"a pivotal role":1.0,"transit services":1.0,"these riders":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7886817769444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.1290000000000004,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8631,"joy":0.0081,"surprise":0.0236,"sadness":0.0352,"fear":0.011,"anger":0.0335,"disgust":0.0255},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper presents heuristic algorithms for transit network design that consider latent demand, using real datasets from on-demand multimodal transit systems and scooter-connected transit systems.

We aim to gain insight in the impact of the dynamic network structure on the load balancing dynamics in terms of the occupancy process which describes the empirical distribution of the number of tasks across the servers. This process evolves on the underlying dynamic graph, and its dynamics depend on the number of tasks at each individual server and the neighborhood structure of the graph. We establish that this dependency disappears in the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ when $\\lambda_n / n \\to \\lambda$ and $\\mu_n \\to \\infty$, and prove that the limit of the occupancy process is given by a system of differential equations that depends solely on $\\lambda$ and the limiting degree distribution of the graph.

In each case, depending on the $\\ell_0$-norm of the mean change vector, we separately consider dense and sparse regimes. We characterise the boundary between the dense and sparse regimes under the above two tail conditions for the first time in the change point literature and propose novel testing procedures that attain optimal rates in each of the four regimes up to a poly-iterated logarithmic factor. By comparing with previous results under Gaussian assumptions, our results quantify the costs of heavy-tailedness on the fundamental difficulty of change point testing problems for high-dimensional data. To be specific, when the error distributions possess exponentially-decaying tails, a CUSUM-type statistic is shown to achieve a minimax testing rate up to $\\sqrt{\\log\\log(8n)}$. As for polynomially-decaying tails, admitting bounded $\\alpha$-th moments for some $\\alpha \\geq 4$, we introduce a median-of-means-type test statistic that achieves a near-optimal testing rate in both dense and sparse regimes. In the sparse regime, we further propose a computationally-efficient test to achieve optimality. Our investigation in the even more challenging case of $2 \\leq \\alpha < 4$, unveils a new phenomenon that the minimax testing rate has no sparse regime, i.e.\\ testing sparse changes is information-theoretically as hard as testing dense changes. Finally, we consider various extensions where we also obtain near-optimal performances, including testing against multiple change points, allowing temporal dependence as well as fewer than two finite moments in the data generating mechanisms. We also show how sub-Gaussian rates can be achieved when an additional minimal spacing condition is imposed under the alternative hypothesis.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18987","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.386585","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","statme","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":273,"author":"Mengchu Li, Yudong Chen, Tengyao Wang, Yi Yu","raw_content_length":1919,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.365,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":["up to $\\sqrt{\\log\\log(8n"]},"char_count":1916,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robust mean change point testing","Announce Type","Abstract","mean change point testing problems","high-dimensional data","exponentially- or polynomially-decaying tails","each case","the ell_0-norm","the mean change vector","the boundary"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["exponentially- or polynomially-decaying tails"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robust mean change point testing":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"mean change point testing problems":1.0,"high-dimensional data":1.0,"exponentially- or polynomially-decaying tails":1.0,"each case":1.0,"the ell_0-norm":1.0,"the mean change vector":1.0,"the boundary":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7888086825,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9241,"joy":0.0108,"surprise":0.027,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0095,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on developing novel statistical methods for detecting change points in high-dimensional data, particularly in the context of heavy-tailed distributions.

Crucially, the occupied process $(\\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods. In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver.

The fine shape category, as defined by Melikhov, seems to hold promise in terms of both applicability and simplicity: it is a different extension of compact strong shape to a generalized homotopy theory of metrizable spaces that is compatible with both \\v{C}ech cohomology and Steenrod-Sitnikov homology, and its definition lends itself to straightforward proofs. Further research seems to be in order. One goal to have in mind is to show the fine shape category to be a homotopy category in Quillen's sense, which implies representation as a localization. But the strong shape of compacta was shown to be a left fraction localization in several ways; we extend the representation given by Cathey to fine shape, introducing the notion of FDR-embeddings to extend Cathey's SSDR-maps. In the process, we also introduce what we call the mapping cylinder of an approaching map; such a construction has been defined by Ferry and elaborated on by Mrozik in the compact case, yet it seems the direct extension on noncompact spaces is not possible. Thus we resort to a somewhat different definition.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11624","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.391388","language":"en","tags":["mathgn","mathgt","mathat","preprints","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Vladislav Zemlyanoy","raw_content_length":1345,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Melikhov","Quillen"],"locations":["Sitnikov","Steenrod"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1344,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["metrizable spaces","Fine shape","a left fraction localization","arXiv231111624v3","Announce Type","Abstract","The strong shape category","compact metrizable spaces","compacta","spaces"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"metrizable spaces":3.0,"Fine shape":2.0,"a left fraction localization":2.0,"arXiv231111624v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The strong shape category":1.0,"compact metrizable spaces":1.0,"compacta":1.0,"spaces":1.0}},"age_hours":2.788967329166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.3895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8779,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8866,"joy":0.0288,"surprise":0.0615,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.0045,"anger":0.0069,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is theoretical mathematics research.

Our analysis assumes that the growth of the Hessian approximation is controlled by the number of successful iterations.

The faster the Hessian approximation grows, the more the bound deteriorates. We construct an objective that satisfies all of our assumptions and for which our complexity bound is attained, which establishes that our bound is sharp. To the best of our knowledge, our complexity result is the first to consider potentially unbounded Hessians and is a first step towards addressing a conjecture of Powell [38] that trust-region methods may require an exponential number of iterations in such a case.

They are inhomogeneous polynomials whose top terms are Jack and Macdonald polynomials. Thus the expansion coefficients for the product of two interpolation polynomials, known as Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, generalize the corresponding coefficients for Jack/Macdonald polynomials. Special values of interpolation polynomials, known as binomial coefficients, arise in the binomial type expansions of Jack/Macdonald polynomials and Koornwinder polynomials. We prove a number of results for interpolation polynomials and the associated coefficients. These include positivity and monotonicity results for binomial coefficients, partial positivity results for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, and weighted sum formulas for both kinds of coefficients. As a special case of our results we obtain a new symmetric function inequality, which establishes a ``duality'' between Jack expansion positivity for symmetric functions, and the containment order on partitions, with respect to the shifted basis $\\Omega_\\lambda({\\bf1}+x;\\tau)$, where ${\\bf1} =(1,\\ldots,1)$ and $\\Omega_\\lambda(x;\\tau)=P_\\lambda(x;\\tau)/P_\\lambda({\\bf1};\\tau)$ is the normalized Jack polynomial.

As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \\mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. This has only been established for relative volumes close to $0$, $1/2$ and $1$ by compactness arguments. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\\bar v \\in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\\beta=1$) for all $\\bar v \\leq 0.120582$, when $\\beta \\leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\\bar v \\in [0,1/2] \\setminus (\\frac{1}{\\pi} - \\frac{\\beta}{4},\\frac{1}{\\pi} + \\frac{\\beta}{4})$.

This programme offers an alternative to the Almgren--Pitts and Allen--Cahn approaches, with advantageous features both from the existence and regularity viewpoints. We build on recent work in which the author and collaborators constructed infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, establishing a full analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\\in(0,1)$. The present article first proves a Weyl-type Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces. The rest -- and main part -- of the article is devoted to obtaining uniform estimates (in the classical limit $s\\to 1$) for min-max $s$-minimal surfaces in closed three-manifolds, eventually establishing their convergence to smooth, classical minimal surfaces. We recover in particular recent results on existence, generic density and equidistribution of minimal surfaces, which are a strong form of Yau's conjecture in this setting.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12162","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.402372","language":"en","tags":["mathdg","preprints","mathap","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Enric Florit-Simon","raw_content_length":1249,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Allen--Cahn"],"persons":["Law","Weyl","s\\in(0,1)$.","Yau","Almgren"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1244,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Weyl Law","convergence","the classical limit","min","Announce Type","Abstract","nonlocal minimal surfaces","a new approximation theory","the area","the context"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["min"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Weyl Law":2.0,"convergence":2.0,"the classical limit":2.0,"min":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"nonlocal minimal surfaces":1.0,"a new approximation theory":1.0,"the area":1.0,"the context":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7893445058333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7562,"joy":0.1487,"surprise":0.0706,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0081,"disgust":0.0025},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on minimal surfaces and their convergence.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_64d2cf250d60","title":"Gaudin models and moduli space of flower curves","content":"arXiv:2407.06424v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We introduce and study the family of trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras in $U g^{\\otimes n}$ for arbitrary simple Lie algebra $g$. This is the family of commutative subalgebras of maximal possible transcendence degree that serve as a universal source for higher integrals of the trigonometric Gaudin quantum spin chain attached to $g$. We study the parameter space that indexes all possible degenerations of subalgebras from this family. In particular, we show that (rational) inhomogeneous Gaudin subalgebras of $ U g^{\\otimes n}$ previously studied in \\cite{ffry} arise as certain limits of trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras. Moreover, we show that both families of commutative subalgebras glue together into the one parameterized by the space $\\overline{\\mathcal F}_n$, which is the total space of degeneration of the Deligne-Mumford space of stable rational curves $ \\overline M_{n+2} $ to the moduli space of cactus flower curves $ \\overline F_n $ recently introduced in \\cite{iklpr}. As an application, we show that trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras act on tensor products of irreducible finite-dimensional $g$-modules without multiplicities, under some explicit assumptions on the parameters in terms of two different real forms of $\\overline M_{n+2}$. This gives rise to a monodromy action of the affine cactus group on the set of eigenstates for the trigonometric Gaudin model. We also explain the relation between the trigonometric Gaudin model and the quantum cohomology of affine Grassmannians slices.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06424","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.403931","language":"en","tags":["mathrt","preprints","mathqa","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Aleksei Ilin, Joel Kamnitzer, Leonid Rybnikov","raw_content_length":1562,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.14,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Lie algebra $g$.","Deligne-Mumford","Gaudin","\\cite{ffry"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\overline{\\mathcal"]},"char_count":1561,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Gaudin models","moduli space","flower curves","the family","arXiv240706424v2","Announce Type","Abstract","trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras","U gotimes","commutative subalgebras"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Gaudin models":2.0,"moduli space":2.0,"flower curves":2.0,"the family":2.0,"arXiv240706424v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras":1.0,"U gotimes":1.0,"commutative subalgebras":1.0}},"age_hours":2.789397506388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6854,"joy":0.1091,"surprise":0.1774,"sadness":0.0101,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0105,"disgust":0.0025},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

Alon related the maximum density of a linear graph code which avoids images of a small graph $H$ to the following variant of the Erd\\H{o}s-Gy\\'arf\\'as problem on edge-colourings of $K_n$. A copy of $H$ in an edge-colouring of $K_n$ is even-chromatic if each colour occupies an even number of edges in the copy. We seek an edge-colouring of $K_n$ using $n^{o(1)}$ colours such that there are no even-chromatic copies of $H$. Such an edge-colouring is conjectured to exist for all cliques $K_t$ with an even number of edges. To date, edge-colourings satisfying this property have been constructed for $K_4$ and $K_5$. We construct an edge-colouring using $n^{o(1)}$ colours which avoids even-chromatic copies of $K_8$. This was the smallest open case of the above conjecture, as $K_6, K_7$ each has an odd number of edges. We also study a stronger condition on edge-colourings, where for each copy of $H$, there is a colour occupying exactly one edge in the copy. We conjecture that an edge-colouring using $n^{o(1)}$ colours and satisfying this stronger requirement exists for all cliques $K_t$ regardless of the parity of the number of its edges. We construct edge-colourings satisfying this stronger property for $K_4$ and $K_5$. These constructions also improve upon the number of colours needed for the original problem of avoiding even-chromatic copies of $K_4$ and $K_5$.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16778","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.410313","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","mathematics","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Fredy Yip","raw_content_length":1590,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Alon"],"persons":["K_t$","K_n$","Announce Type","K_5$."],"locations":[],"monetary":["$K_4$","n^{o(1)}$","K_8$.","$H$.

Wang and Zhu (2023) showed that for the Wasserstein metric $\\mathcal{W}_2$ and for $d\\geq 5$, the convergence rate of $T^{-1/(d-2)}$ is attained by the occupation measure of the path $(X_t)_{t\\in [0,T]}$ when $(X_t)_{t\\in [0,T]}$ is a Langevin diffusion. We extend their result in several directions. First, we show that the rate of convergence holds for a large class of diffusion paths, whose generators are uniformly elliptic. Second, the regularity of the density $p$ of the stationary measure $\\mu$ with respect to the volume measure of $\\mathcal{M}$ can be leveraged to obtain faster estimators: when $p$ belongs to a Sobolev space of order $\\ell\\geq 2$, smoothing the occupation measure by convolution with a kernel yields an estimator whose rate of convergence is of order $T^{-(\\ell+1)/(2\\ell+d-2)}$. We further show that this rate is the minimax rate of estimation for this problem.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11777","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.412217","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","mathst","preprints","statth","research","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Vincent Divol, H\\'el\\`ene Gu\\'erin, Dinh-Toan Nguyen, Viet Chi Tran","raw_content_length":1170,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Langevin","Sobolev","Zhu","Wasserstein","Wang","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["T^{-1/(d-2)}$","$d\\geq 5$","$\\mathcal{W}_2$","$d$-dimensional manifold"]},"char_count":1169,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Measure estimation","a manifold","a diffusion process","X_t_tin","arXiv241011777v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the observation","a diffusion path","boundary","the problem"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Measure estimation":2.0,"a manifold":2.0,"a diffusion process":2.0,"X_t_tin":2.0,"arXiv241011777v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the observation":1.0,"a diffusion path":1.0,"boundary":1.0,"the problem":1.0}},"age_hours":2.789690591388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8629,"joy":0.0235,"surprise":0.0736,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0093,"anger":0.0183,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical advance in estimating stationary measures of diffusion processes on manifolds.
