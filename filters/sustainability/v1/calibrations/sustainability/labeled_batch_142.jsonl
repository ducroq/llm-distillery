{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_6f57acae4758","title":"A complete formalism for giant Goos","content":"arXiv:2510.10788v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Giant Goos-H\\\"anchen shift is a promising effect for very highly sensitive sensors application. For sensors working at the critical coupling regime, we provide here a complete formalism that describes analytically the Goos-Hanchen shift, the Goos-H\\\"anchen sensitivity and the limit of detection. It reveals the key parameters (quality factor, angular dispersion but also the phase singularity) which are involved in the GH shift. Approaching the critical coupling leads to ultimate Goos-H\\\"anchen shift and sensitivity. Thanks to this theoretical description confirmed numerically, we propose lateral beam displacement that goes beyond giant GH shift and sensitivity values as high as $10^{13} {\\mu}m/RIU$ which is an improvement of Goos-H\\\"anchen sensitivity by more than one thousand compared to theoretical value and more than ten million if compared to experimental works. We illustrate it for surface plasmon resonance of thin metal film where the critical coupling is approached with the crystallisation of a phase change material GST and for metasurfaces supporting Bloch Surface Waves. We also discuss the effect of beam size on GH effect and showed that it is the main limitation for increasing GH sensitivty and is a parameter that must be considered. The limit of detection of GH sensors is finally described analytically. Theses results open the way for new sensing application needing high sensitivity.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10788","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.668205","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Lotfi Berguiga, S\\'ebastien Cueff, Taha Benyattou, Xavier Letartre, C\\'ecile Jamois","raw_content_length":1465,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1464,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A complete formalism","giant Goos","Announce Type","new Abstract","Giant Goos-Hanchen shift","a promising effect","very highly sensitive sensors application","sensors","the critical coupling regime","a complete formalism"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A complete formalism":2.0,"giant Goos":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Giant Goos-Hanchen shift":1.0,"a promising effect":1.0,"very highly sensitive sensors application":1.0,"sensors":1.0,"the critical coupling regime":1.0,"a complete formalism":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7746600455555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.84,"joy":0.0454,"surprise":0.074,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0124,"anger":0.0151,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical framework for highly sensitive sensors using the giant Goos-H\"anchen shift.

At each iteration, a block of variables is selected by means of a greedy (Gauss-Southwell) rule which considers the amount of first-order stationarity violation, then an approximate minimizer of a cubic model is computed for the block update. In the proposed scheme, blocks are not required to have a predetermined structure and their size may change during the iterations. For non-convex objective functions, global convergence to stationary points is proved and a worst-case iteration complexity analysis is provided. In particular, given a tolerance $\\epsilon$, we show that at most ${\\cal O(\\epsilon^{-3/2})}$ iterations are needed to drive the stationarity violation with respect to a selected block of variables below $\\epsilon$, while at most ${\\cal O(\\epsilon^{-2})}$ iterations are needed to drive the stationarity violation with respect to all variables below $\\epsilon$.
