Conservation of wave-action flux provides the theoretical baseline for how fluctuation amplitudes scale with the Alfv\\'en Mach number $M_a$, once solar-wind acceleration is accounted for. Departures from this scaling quantify the net balance between energy injection and dissipation. Fluctuation amplitudes follow wave-action conservation for $M_a < M_a^{b}$ but steepen beyond this break point, which typically lies near the Alfv\\'en surface ($M_a \\approx 1$) yet varies systematically with normalized cross helicity $\\sigma_c$ and fluctuation scale. In slow, quasi-balanced streams, the transition occurs at $M_a \\lesssim 1$; in fast, imbalanced wind, WKB-like scaling persists to $M_a \\gtrsim 1$. Outer-scale fluctuations maintain wave-action conservation to larger $M_a$ than inertial-range modes. The turbulent heating rate $Q$ is largest below $M_a^{b}$, indicating a preferential heating zone shaped by the degree of imbalance. Despite this, the Alfv\\'enic energy flux $F_a$ remains elevated, and the corresponding damping length $\\Lambda_d = F_a/Q$ remains sufficiently large to permit long-range propagation before appreciable damping occurs. Normalized damping lengths $\\Lambda_d/H_A$, where $H_A$ is the inverse Alfv\\'en-speed scale height, are near unity for $M_a \\lesssim M_a^{b}$ but decline with increasing $M_a$ and decreasing $U$, implying that incompressible reflection-driven turbulence alone cannot account for the observed dissipation. Additional damping mechanisms -- such as compressible effects -- are likely required to account for the observed heating rates across much of the parameter space.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10106","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.709835","language":"en","tags":["physicsspace-ph","preprints","astro-phsr","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Nikos Sioulas, Marco Velli, Chen Shi, Trevor A.

The MIR modality captures label-free chemical maps based on molecular vibrations, while the fluorescence channel records endogenous autofluorescence for additional biochemical contrast. Applied to mouse brain tissue, the system enabled the clear differentiation of gray matter and white matter, supported by the clustering analysis of spectral features. The addition of autofluorescence imaging further improved anatomical segmentation and revealed fine structural details. In mouse skin, the approach allowed the precise mapping of the layered tissue architecture.

To address the issues of rapidly increasing computation time and deteriorating scheduling quality in traditional scheduling algorithms for large-scale TTE applications, this paper proposes a hybrid scheduling algorithm based on critical-link optimization. A large-scale TTE message scheduling model is established based on the characteristics of Time-Triggered (TT) messages, and the constraints of TT scheduling are mathematically abstracted. After identifying the critical link of the network, a time slot balancing scheduling algorithm based on static priority is adopted for the link. The algorithm searches for the optimal scheduling time of current message by time-sliding within the current maximum time gap of TT messages from the center to both sides, maximizing the balance of TT message intervals to reduce the impact on Best-Effort (BE) message transmission performance. An improved genetic algorithm is proposed for the scheduling of the entire network to further enhance the global optimization capability, which takes the scheduling results of the critical link as the genes of initial population. The TT scheduling constraints are converted into the fitness function and the optimized genetic operators are developed for the genetic algorithm. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce computing time and increase the success rate of message scheduling. At the same time, the scheduling results exhibit a better degree of TT message balance and can effectively reduce the transmission delay and jitter of BE messages as message load increases compared with traditional algorithms, making it better meet the scheduling requirements of large-scale TTE application scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6347","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.591826","language":"en","tags":["sensors","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Zhonghe Jin","raw_content_length":1908,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IIoT","Time-Triggered Ethernet","Time-Triggered","a Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm Based","Critical-Link Optimization for Large"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1908,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Research","a Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm","Critical-Link Optimization","the rapid development","the Industrial Internet","Things","IIoT","the application scale"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["Research"],"research_academic":["Research"],"ai_ml":["a Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm"],"engineering":["the rapid development","IIoT"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Research":2.0,"a Hybrid Scheduling Algorithm":2.0,"Critical-Link Optimization":2.0,"the rapid development":1.0,"the Industrial Internet":1.0,"Things":1.0,"IIoT":1.0,"the application scale":1.0}},"age_hours":13.235276193055554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9288,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.023,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0105},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a hybrid scheduling algorithm for Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE) in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to reduce computation time and improve scheduling quality.

First, by analyzing the principles of target detection and jamming effects, a multi-terrain random fluctuation model for ground detection is established. Second, the time-frequency domain weighted fusion method is proposed. Taking multi-period time domain + time-frequency domain as jamming recognition information, combined with the attention mechanism, the jamming recognition model based on time-frequency domain weighted fusion and the attention mechanism (TFWF-AM) is established. Then, the single jamming and compound jamming sample sets are established by superimposing the beating signals of target echo and multi-jamming. Finally, the accuracy of the TFWF-AM jamming recognition model is compared with that of existing method models, and the effectiveness of multi-period time domain + time-frequency domain information is verified. The results show that the TFWF-AM jamming recognition model has the highest accuracy for both single jamming and compound jamming, reaching 99.92% and 99.56%, respectively, which is 10.42% and 52.81% higher than that of the feature fusion model.

This emphasizes the critical necessity of track perimeter intrusion monitoring systems. Consequently, an intelligent monitoring system employing trackside cameras is constructed, integrating weakly supervised video anomaly detection and unsupervised foreground segmentation, which offers a solution for monitoring foreign objects on high-speed train tracks. To address the challenges of complex dataset annotation and unidentified target detection, weakly supervised learning detection is proposed to track foreign object intrusions based on video. The pretraining of Xception3D and the integration of multiple attention mechanisms have markedly enhanced the feature extraction capabilities. The Top-K sample selection alongside the amplitude score/feature loss function effectively discriminates abnormal from normal samples, incorporating time-smoothing constraints to ensure detection consistency across consecutive frames. Once abnormal video frames are identified, a multiscale variational autoencoder is proposed for the positioning of foreign objects. A downsampling/upsampling module is optimized to increase feature extraction efficiency. The pixel-level background weight distribution loss function is engineered to jointly balance background authenticity and noise resistance. Ultimately, the experimental results indicate that the video anomaly detection model achieved an AUC of 0.99 on the track anomaly detection dataset and processes 2 s video segments in 0.41 s. The proposed foreground segmentation algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.9030 in the track anomaly dataset and 0.8375 on CDnet2014, with 91 Frames per Second, confirming its efficacy.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6344","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.593096","language":"en","tags":["sensors","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Changfan Wang","raw_content_length":1895,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Xception3D"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1895,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Dual Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection","Unsupervised Segmentation","The high operational velocities","high-speed trains","present constraints","their onboard track intrusion detection systems","real-time capture","analysis"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["high-speed trains"],"business_innovation":["analysis"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Dual Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection":2.0,"Unsupervised Segmentation":2.0,"The high operational velocities":1.0,"high-speed trains":1.0,"present constraints":1.0,"their onboard track intrusion detection systems":1.0,"real-time capture":1.0,"analysis":1.0}},"age_hours":13.23533741027778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.706,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4588,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8542,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.017,"sadness":0.0129,"fear":0.0487,"anger":0.0288,"disgust":0.0326},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a track intrusion detection system using video anomaly detection and foreground segmentation.

Federated learning (FL) is a distributed ML technique developed to learn from such distributed data while ensuring privacy. Nevertheless, traditional FL requires a central server for aggregation, which can be a central point of failure and raises trust issues. Blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) has emerged as an FL extension that provides guaranteed decentralization alongside other security assurances. However, due to the inherent openness of blockchain, BFL comes with several vulnerabilities that remain unexplored in literature, e.g., a higher possibility of model poisoning attacks. This paper investigates how scaling-based model poisoning attacks are made easier in BFL systems and their effects on model performance. Subsequently, it proposes FedECPA-an extension of FedAvg aggregation algorithm with Efficient Countermeasure against scaling-based model Poisoning Attacks in BFL. FedECPA filters out clients with outlier weights and protects the model against these attacks. Several experiments are conducted with different attack scenarios and settings. We further compared our results to a frequently used defense mechanism, Multikrum. Results show the effectiveness of our defense mechanism in protecting BFL from these attacks. On the MNIST dataset, it maintains an overall accuracy of 98% and 89% and outperforms our baseline with 4% and 38% in both IID and non-IID settings, respectively.

While fNIRS has been widely used in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, a key challenge persists: the lack of practical tools required for calibrating source-detector separation (SDS) to maximize sensitivity at depth (SAD) for monitoring specific cortical regions of interest to neuroscience and neuroimaging studies. This study presents DrSVision version 1.0, a standalone software developed to address this limitation. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed using segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from eight cadaveric heads to realistically model light attenuation across anatomical layers. SAD of 10–20 mm with SDS of 19–39 mm was computed. The dataset was used to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based machine learning (ML) model that recommends optimal SDS for achieving maximal sensitivity at targeted depths. The software operates independently of any third-party platforms and provides users with region-specific calibration outputs tailored for experimental goals, supporting more precise application of fNIRS. Future developments aim to incorporate subject-specific calibration using anatomical data and broaden support for diverse and personalized experimental setups.

The enhanced DNB controller is benchmarked against (1) a fixed-time traffic signal control using the state-of-practice Webster’s method and an emerging Laguna-Du-Rakha (LDR) method for computing the optimum cycle length; (2) a state-of-the-practice actuated traffic signal control; and (3) a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) traffic signal controller presented in the literature. The controller is tested on two isolated signalized intersections, demonstrating enhanced overall intersection performance compared to the baseline pretimed and actuated controllers at various demand levels, and offers better performance than a previously developed RL controller. Specifically, the DNB controller results in a decrease in the average vehicle delay and queue size by up to 54% and 63%, respectively, compared to Webster’s state-of-the-practice pretimed control. Unlike the RL controller, the DNB controller requires no pre-training while adapting to fluctuating traffic conditions, thereby providing a flexible framework for reducing traffic congestion at signalized intersections.

VR applications impose strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, necessitating low latency and high throughput. Meeting VR QoS requirements in Wi-Fi networks is especially challenging due to unpredictable channel fading and interference. This paper presents a comprehensive scalability study of Wi-Fi performance in multi-user VR scenarios. We investigate whether simply increasing Access Point (AP) capabilities, specifically through Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO), is sufficient to support dense VR deployments. To this end, we developed a high-fidelity simulation framework in ns-3 to estimate the network capacity when serving VR traffic. Our analysis meticulously evaluates the impact of critical factors, including the number of antennas at the AP and STAs, MU-MIMO scheduling algorithms, channel sounding period, and different channel conditions. The results reveal a critical finding: Scalability is not linear. In particular, doubling AP antennas from 8 to 16 yields only a 35% gain in capacity under typical conditions, not the 100% linear scaling one might expect. We identify and analyze the key bottlenecks that prevent performance from scaling indefinitely with an increased number of AP antennas, providing crucial insights for the design of next-generation Wi-Fi systems aimed at supporting the Metaverse and future immersive VR applications.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6338","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.594360","language":"en","tags":["sensors","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Evgeny Khorov","raw_content_length":1448,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Virtual Reality","Access Point","MU-MIMO","antennas","Quality of Service","Multi-User"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1448,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Scalability","The adoption","Virtual Reality VR applications","Wi-Fi networks intensifies","VR applications","strict Quality","Service QoS requirements","low latency"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Scalability":2.0,"The adoption":1.0,"Virtual Reality VR applications":1.0,"Wi-Fi networks intensifies":1.0,"VR applications":1.0,"strict Quality":1.0,"Service QoS requirements":1.0,"low latency":1.0}},"age_hours":13.235400841666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4775,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1045,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8912,"joy":0.0108,"surprise":0.0453,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0235,"anger":0.0155,"disgust":0.0081},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a simulation study of Wi-Fi performance for VR applications.

In this paper, we introduce a medium-scale dataset, containing measurements of walking/running at speeds ranging from 4.0 km/h (1.11 m/s) to 9.5 km/h (2.64 m/s) in increments of 0.5 km/h (0.14 m/s) from 33 healthy subjects wearing IMUs. We name it the “Speed” dataset. In summary, we present accelerometer and gyroscope data from 12 speeds and 22 subject-independent sets with the full range of 12 speeds. The data in each set consists of overlapping sections of 250 time samples (corresponding to 2.5 s, sampled at 100 Hz), and six dimensions (corresponding to the three axes of the accelerometer and three axes of the gyroscope). Each speed set contains 1775 examples. We benchmark the existing approaches used in the literature for the purpose of speed estimation on this dataset. These include support vector regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and shallow neural networks. We then design a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), SpeedNet, for baseline results. The proposed SpeedNet yields an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.4819 km/h (0.13 m/s), following a subject-independent approach. Then, the SpeedNet obtained from the subject-independent approach are adapted using a portion of subject-specific data.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sensors_5974bd4dad04","title":"Sensors, Vol. 25, Pages 6333: Robust Underwater Docking Visual Guidance and Positioning Method Based on a Cage","content":"Due to the limited and fixed field of view of the onboard camera, the guiding beacons gradually drift out of sight as the AUV approaches the docking station, resulting in unreliable positioning and intermittent data. This paper proposes an underwater autonomous docking visual localization method based on a cage-type dual-layer guiding light array. To address the gradual loss of beacon visibility during AUV approach, a rationally designed localization scheme employing a cage-type, dual-layer guiding light array is presented. A dual-layer light array localization algorithm is introduced to accommodate varying beacon appearances at different docking stages by dynamically distinguishing between front and rear guiding light arrays. Following layer-wise separation of guiding lights, a robust tag-matching framework is constructed for each layer. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed for high-precision initial tag matching, and a filtering strategy based on distance and angular ratio consistency eliminates unreliable matches. Under extreme conditions with three missing lights or two spurious beacons, the method achieves 90.3% and 99.6% matching success rates, respectively. After applying filtering strategy, error correction using backtracking extended Kalman filter (BTEKF) brings matching success rate to 99.9%. Simulations and underwater experiments demonstrate stable and robust tag matching across all docking phases, with average detection time of 0.112 s, even when handling dual-layer arrays. The proposed method achieves continuous visual guidance-based docking for autonomous AUV recovery.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6333","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.595951","language":"en","tags":["sensors","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Zhiyu Liao","raw_content_length":1618,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AUV","PSO"],"persons":["array localization algorithm","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1618,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Robust Underwater Docking","Visual Guidance","Positioning Method","a Cage","the limited and fixed field","view","the onboard camera","the guiding beacons"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["view"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Robust Underwater Docking":2.0,"Visual Guidance":2.0,"Positioning Method":2.0,"a Cage":2.0,"the limited and fixed field":1.0,"view":1.0,"the onboard camera":1.0,"the guiding beacons":1.0}},"age_hours":13.235481704722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8482,"joy":0.0024,"surprise":0.024,"sadness":0.0121,"fear":0.0526,"anger":0.023,"disgust":0.0377},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed underwater docking system for AUVs, with demonstrated performance in simulations and underwater experiments.

This systematic literature review examines how pedagogical approaches used in secondary education foster students’ environmental literacy. The review enriches the current literature by shifting attention away from the predominant focus on higher education and providing new empirically grounded insights into the effectiveness of classroom practices in enhancing students’ environmental literacy at the secondary education level. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 22 peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2024 were identified through Web of Science, Scopus and ERIC. The analysis is guided by Joyce and Calhoun’s taxonomy of teaching models and the conceptualization of environmental literacy developed by the North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE). Findings show that strategies grounded in the social family and information-processing models of teaching were most frequently used, reflecting a pedagogical shift toward collaboration, critical thinking, and active engagement, yet a significant gap remains in cultivating environmentally responsible behavior (ERB). The review highlights the need for pedagogical designs that support the integration of every dimension of environmental literacy. It further emphasizes culturally responsive approaches and systematic investment in teacher professional development as critical conditions for pedagogical success.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9104","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.799312","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Ruizhi Zhu","raw_content_length":1644,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews","Meta-Analyses","Scopus"],"persons":["Joyce","ERIC","Calhoun"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1614,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Pedagogical Strategies","Environmental Literacy","Secondary School Education","A Systematic Review","Environmental literacy","students","the knowledge","skills"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Pedagogical Strategies":2.0,"Environmental Literacy":2.0,"Secondary School Education":2.0,"A Systematic Review":2.0,"Environmental literacy":1.0,"students":1.0,"the knowledge":1.0,"skills":1.0}},"age_hours":13.23591433,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7993,"joy":0.0254,"surprise":0.0077,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.0422,"anger":0.0326,"disgust":0.0852},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This systematic review analyzes existing pedagogical strategies for environmental literacy in secondary education.

This review synthesizes evidence from financial economics and sectoral labor analysis to assess the impact of ESG performance and green employment on corporate financial performance (CFP) and broader economic growth. Using a discounted cash-flow framework and sectoral panel data from European economies (2008–2023), the findings reveal that robust ESG practices improve operating profits, reduce financial risk and support higher dividend distributions, while green jobs contribute significantly to Gross Value Added (GVA) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with each additional green job adding approximately EUR 101.920 to GVA and EUR 135.000 to GDP, in annual terms. Sectoral impacts are especially pronounced in construction, energy, and financial services, with annual contributions ranging from EUR 10.4 to EUR 11.1 million in GVA and EUR 13.7 to EUR 14.8 million in GDP. These results underscore the dual role of ESG as a financial indicator and strategic sustainability tool, advancing key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_cbb5b7e36775","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9101: A New Methodology for Optimising Railway Line Capacity: Improving Infrastructure for Sustainable Transport","content":"The sufficient capacity of railway lines is a key prerequisite for stable and sustainable transport, not only on main or high-speed lines, but also on lines of regional importance that complement the network. Their indispensable role is manifested not only daily, but especially in the event of incidents on the backbone network. One of the main characteristics of these support lines is that they are largely single-track. Another important characteristic is that they alternate between sections with different traffic loads, which significantly changes the capacity requirements along the whole line. Existing modernisation approaches are frequently implemented in a non-differentiated manner, thereby lacking segment-specific prioritisation. The present paper introduces a novel methodology for systematic identification and the ranking of line sections for capacity upgrades. The approach is comprised of three distinct steps: first, the line is segmented using traffic homogeneity criteria; second, limiting journey times are determined through analytical capacity calculations based on the ninth decile of train volumes; and third, infrastructure measures are identified when the actual journey times exceed these thresholds. Potential interventions encompass the introduction of additional block sections, the implementation of passing loops, or the introduction of double-tracking. The methodology was applied to the Havlíčkův Brod–Jihlava–Znojmo line, thereby demonstrating its ability to detect bottlenecks and propose targeted measures. The findings indicate that there is considerable potential for enhancing capacity while concomitantly improving operational safety and cost efficiency. Consequently, this will serve to reinforce the role of diversionary lines within the broader context of the rail network. The proposed framework provides infrastructure managers with a generalisable tool with which to prioritise investments and support the long-term development of resilient and sustainable railway systems.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9101","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.800204","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Milan Dedík","raw_content_length":2073,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2024,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","A New Methodology","Optimising Railway Line Capacity","Infrastructure","Sustainable Transport","The sufficient capacity","railway lines","a key prerequisite","stable and sustainable transport"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A New Methodology":2.0,"Optimising Railway Line Capacity":2.0,"Infrastructure":2.0,"Sustainable Transport":2.0,"The sufficient capacity":1.0,"railway lines":1.0,"a key prerequisite":1.0,"stable and sustainable transport":1.0}},"age_hours":13.23594448138889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6045,"joy":0.0883,"surprise":0.0112,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.1884,"anger":0.0525,"disgust":0.0415},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a methodology for optimizing railway line capacity, which could lead to reduced energy consumption and emissions per passenger/ton of freight.

This study investigates how CO2–brine–rock interactions alter porosity and permeability in carbonate and sandstone reservoirs. We quantify pore-scale changes and effects of CO2-saturated brine on rock. In calcite-rich carbonates, CO2-induced acidification enhances permeability through selective dissolution. Dolomite-rich samples and sandstones exhibit suppressed permeability response due to slower dissolution and pore clogging. μCT and SEM reveal that although bulk porosity changes are small, local changes—especially formation of micropores and mineral occlusions—substantially influence permeability. Geochemical modeling confirms three-stage evolution: early dissolution, intermediate buffering with onset of precipitation, and long-term mineral trapping with near-steady porosity. The results indicate that early injectivity gains may be temporary and that proactive monitoring and management are required to safeguard long-term storage integrity. The findings provide actionable insight for sustainable CCS design, risk assessment, and reservoir stewardship.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9102","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.800583","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Grzegorz Leśniak","raw_content_length":1299,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1252,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Pore","permeability","The rise","atmospheric CO2","the urgency","carbon capture","storage","CCS"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"hydrogen_energy":["storage"],"renewable_energy":["storage"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Pore":2.0,"permeability":2.0,"The rise":1.0,"atmospheric CO2":1.0,"the urgency":1.0,"carbon capture":1.0,"storage":1.0,"CCS":1.0}},"age_hours":13.235960325555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8158,"joy":0.0107,"surprise":0.0225,"sadness":0.0133,"fear":0.0858,"anger":0.027,"disgust":0.0249},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":true},"reasoning":"This study quantifies pore-scale changes in carbonate and sandstone reservoirs due to CO2 injection using μCT and SEM.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_c288016a5aa2","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9100: Integrated Quality Management for Automotive Services—Addressing Gaps with European and Japanese Principles","content":"In the current economic context, organizations providing automotive repair services face significant challenges in ensuring service quality, operational efficiency, and long-term sustainability. This paper examines the importance of implementing process monitoring systems through the integration of European quality frameworks and Japanese operational principles such as Kaizen, Lean Manufacturing, and Poka-Yoke, to improve the quality of services and increase performance within automotive repair organizations. The research is grounded in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9—Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, and SDG 12—Responsible Consumption and Production), demonstrating how structured quality practices contribute to reducing waste, optimizing processes, and delivering responsible services. The main objectives of the study are to identify the elements that influence the performance of service-specific processes, to improve the quality management practices related to these processes, to eliminate non-conformities, and to enhance profitability and competitive differentiation through service quality assurance. A mixed-methods research design was applied, including direct participatory observation, performance monitoring, and correlational statistical analysis over a six-month period in two Romanian automotive service centers. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as technician efficiency, rework rate, and order throughput time were collected and analyzed before and after the implementation of selected tools. Findings demonstrate measurable improvements: rework rates decreased from 7.8% to 2.6%, technician efficiency improved from 89% to 105%, and average service completion time was reduced by 1.6 days. Correlation analysis confirmed strong relationships between visual management adoption and rework reduction (r = −0.75), as well as between Lean implementation and technician efficiency (r = +0.89). The study’s novelty lies in its integration of cross-cultural quality management practices into a replicable and sustainable operational model for post-sale service environments.

This review identifies and categorizes the main policy levers supporting the adoption of Circular Business Models (CBM) in an analytical framework comprising eight determinants: policy agenda, governance, regulation, standardization, economic incentives, information, cooperation, and digitalization. Based on a semi-systematic review of 95 scientific and grey literature sources, the study reveals persistent gaps in policy coherence, governance coordination, and support for high-circularity strategies. The proposed framework offers a practical tool for policymakers to assess existing policy landscapes, identify gaps, and design integrated policy mixes tailored to specific contexts.

Several approaches have been practiced so far in the restoration of rangeland; however, optimization of irrigation practice is considered to be a promising strategy to restore native shrubs’ growth, by improving water distribution and plants’ physiological growth. In this study, a field experiment was conducted across three semi-arid sites, including Al-Tamiryyat (Al-Jouf), Al-Sahwa (Al-Madina), and Al-Fuhaihil (Thadiq), to assess the impact of drip and sprinkler irrigation on the growth dynamics of region-specific native shrubs. Plant growth parameters like plant height, stem diameter, and crown size ratio were measured monthly over 12 months (June 2024–June 2025). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed that drip irrigation significantly enhanced growth performance compared to sprinkler and control treatments across all sites. Plant height increased up to 142% in Haloxylon persicum, while the stem diameter of Vachellia gerrardii expanded by nearly 198% under drip irrigation. Crown size ratio exhibited site- and species-dependent temporal patterns, with drip irrigation consistently supporting greater canopy expansion. Meanwhile, the interactions between irrigation type, species, and time were significant at most sites, indicating temporal and contextual variability in growth dynamics. Overall, these findings demonstrate that drip irrigation has substantial potential for the rangeland restoration in water-limited environments. However, future studies should assess the long-term impact of irrigation practices for a better understanding of soil–plant–water interactions to ensure the restoration of rangelands in arid regions.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9098","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.801655","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Abdulaziz G.

Rooted in the analysis of industry practices and past literature, the present research presents an integrated theme-based perspective on the interplay between focal firms and their suppliers in the context of advanced and emerging economies in underreported Scope 3 activity carbon footprint management. We argue that it is technology-driven unified efforts, which enforce factors such as traceability, transparency, and predictive and prescriptive capabilities within Scope 3 activities, that need to be addressed to ensure the activation and maintenance of a truly sustainable global value chain (GVC).

Existing studies often overlook the spatial heterogeneity of LUCE and the mechanisms behind its driving factors. This study assesses LUCE disparities and explores low-carbon land use pathways in Shanxi to support its sustainable transition. Based on county-level land use data from 1990 to 2022, carbon emissions were estimated, and LUCE was measured using a three-stage super-efficient SBM-DEA model, with stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to control for external noise. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SHAP values was used to identify key socio-economic and environmental drivers. The results show the following: (1) emissions rose 2.46-fold, mainly due to expanding construction land and shrinking cultivated land, with hotspots in Taiyuan, Jinzhong, and Linfen; (2) LUCE improved due to gains in technical and scale efficiency, while pure technical efficiency stayed stable; (3) urbanization and government intervention promoted LUCE, whereas higher per capita GDP constrained it; and (4) population density, economic growth, urbanization, and green technology were the dominant, interacting drivers of land use carbon emissions. This study integrates LUCE assessment with interpretable machine learning, demonstrating a framework that links efficiency evaluation with driver analysis. The findings provide critical insights for formulating regionally adaptive low-carbon land use policies, which are essential for achieving ecological sustainability and supporting the sustainable development of resource-based regions.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9086","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.802235","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Dengrui Liang","raw_content_length":1792,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DEA","Three-Stage Super Achieving","SFA","SBM","LUCE","SHAP"],"persons":[],"locations":["Shanxi Province","Shanxi"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1792,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","A Three-Stage Super","LUCE","carbon peaking","neutrality","global sustainability efforts","climate change","land use carbon emission efficiency","a challenge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Three-Stage Super":2.0,"LUCE":2.0,"carbon peaking":1.0,"neutrality":1.0,"global sustainability efforts":1.0,"climate change":1.0,"land use carbon emission efficiency":1.0,"a challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236037204999999,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.329,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8658,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9335,"joy":0.0066,"surprise":0.0194,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0125},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":true,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study provides a framework for assessing land use carbon emission efficiency (LUCE) using a three-stage super-efficient SBM-DEA model and identifies key socio-economic and environmental drivers using XGBoost.

In China, the “National Pilot Policy of Information Accessibility” has been a key initiative to advance digital governance. Using enterprise registration data from 1206 counties during 2010–2020 and employing a difference-in-differences framework, this study evaluates the policy’s impact on county-level digital entrepreneurial vitality. Results show that the pilot significantly stimulates entrepreneurship, with robust evidence from multiple tests including placebo, PSM-DID, and controls for other policies and the pandemic. Mechanism analysis reveals three main channels: enhancing regional innovation capacity, optimizing employment structure, and strengthening infrastructure.

To achieve this, it examines various streams of the literature, as the topic sits at the intersection of several distinct but relevant disciplinary fields. These include urban planning in hazardous areas, recovery planning, disaster risk reduction (an umbrella term encompassing disciplines from engineering to geography and sociology), and, more recently, climate change adaptation. To navigate this vast body of knowledge, a conceptual framework is proposed to guide the selection of the relevant literature, and the strategy for this selection is detailed in the methodological section. This review adopts elements of both critical and theoretical approaches: it does not aim to be comprehensive or to systematically search each disciplinary domain addressed. While acknowledging the limitations and potential biases in the selection of articles and books, the review reflects an evolution in the discourse on urban planning for resilience. The discussion explores how the concept of resilience has emerged as a valuable bridge between disaster risk reduction, sustainability, and climate change adaptation—especially as cities face increasing exposure and vulnerability to stresses that are now more frequently compounded, multi-hazard, and cascading. The conclusion outlines the gaps and challenges that researchers, practitioners, and policy makers need to address moving forward.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9092","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.803209","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Menoni","raw_content_length":1550,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Crossroads of Research"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1540,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Urban Planning","Disaster Risk Reduction","A Review","the Crossroads","Research","Practice","urban planning","This review"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"healthcare_tech":["Research"],"research_academic":["Research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Urban Planning":2.0,"Disaster Risk Reduction":2.0,"A Review":2.0,"the Crossroads":2.0,"Research":2.0,"Practice":2.0,"urban planning":2.0,"This review":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236085330277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.729,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6542,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7307,"joy":0.0083,"surprise":0.0128,"sadness":0.0158,"fear":0.1752,"anger":0.0295,"disgust":0.0277},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a review article that examines the intersection of urban planning, disaster risk reduction, and climate change adaptation.

This paper develops an incentive-based intelligent parking management system to address the challenges of peak demand by encouraging drivers with flexible schedules to shift their parking from peak to off-peak times. The proposed incentive model regulates peak demand, which has been calibrated using historical data on parking demand and occupancy. The model incorporates empirically derived behavioral parameters (from field surveys) to capture drivers’ sensitivity to incentives. The system’s performance is evaluated via discrete-time simulation using real-world parking data from a Japanese supermarket, considering both weekday and weekend demand patterns. The incentive mechanism redistributed approximately 6% of the total parking demand from peak to off-peak periods, markedly reducing peak congestion. This demand shift resulted in substantial sustainability benefits: CO2 emissions decreased by approximately 21% on weekdays (19.5% on weekends), and fuel consumption decreased by about 25% on weekdays (28% on weekends) compared to a baseline scenario without incentives. The prioritizing of electric cars (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) significantly enhanced emission reductions by promoting cleaner vehicles in the allocation process. This behavioral demand-management strategy offers a practical and scalable solution to enhance urban mobility and sustainability, demonstrating how modest incentives can yield substantial benefits in terms of traffic flow and emissions mitigation.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9093","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.803546","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Kou Yamada","raw_content_length":1653,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Pages 9093:"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1633,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Incentive","peak demand","Urban parking facilities","severe peak-period congestion","delays","fuel consumption","emissions","This paper"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Incentive":2.0,"peak demand":2.0,"Urban parking facilities":1.0,"severe peak-period congestion":1.0,"delays":1.0,"fuel consumption":1.0,"emissions":1.0,"This paper":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236100032222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.088000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8176,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8511,"joy":0.0038,"surprise":0.0139,"sadness":0.0214,"fear":0.0152,"anger":0.0702,"disgust":0.0244},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed incentive-based parking management system in a Japanese supermarket, resulting in a measured 21% reduction in CO2 emissions on weekdays and a 25% decrease in fuel consumption compared to the baseline.

A Model Integrating UTAUT Model and Satisfaction–Loyalty Model","content":"As an emerging technology for sustainable, safe, energy-efficient, and smooth traffic flow, autonomous public transport (APT) has been widely studied in recent years. However, the influence of conventional public transport (CPT) on behavioural intentions toward APT is largely overlooked. While APT is in its nascent phase, users’ choices may be shaped by their perceptions and attitudes toward CPT. Therefore, identifying these perceptions and examining their effect on behavioural intention is crucial. In this study, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is integrated with the satisfaction-loyalty model to analyze the key factors influencing behavioural intentions toward APT. To obtain more precise findings, this study examined public transport by type, including rubber-tired systems, urban rail, and bus rapid transit, rather than as a single mode, unlike many previous studies. A survey (n = 1271) was employed to validate the theoretical model among CPT users in Istanbul. The results indicate that loyalty to CPT significantly influences behavioural intention toward APT. Moreover, users of different CPT types have distinct priorities influencing their intention to use APT. While users of rubber-tired systems prioritize effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions, users of urban rail systems consider social influence, trust and loyalty to CPT to be decisive factors. Furthermore, users of bus rapid transit systems consider performance expectancy, effort expectancy, trust, and loyalty to CPT as key factors influencing their behavioural intention. The findings are expected to enrich theoretical research on behavioural intention toward APT and guide future integration and transition between CPT and APT.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9087","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.803873","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Gozde Bakioglu","raw_content_length":1778,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["APT","Will Conventional Public Transport","the Unified Theory of Acceptance","CPT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1768,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["APT","Sustainability","Pages","Autonomous Public Transport","A Model Integrating UTAUT Model","Satisfaction","Loyalty Model","CPT","an emerging technology","smooth traffic flow"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"APT":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Autonomous Public Transport":2.0,"A Model Integrating UTAUT Model":2.0,"Satisfaction":2.0,"Loyalty Model":2.0,"CPT":2.0,"an emerging technology":1.0,"smooth traffic flow":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236116026944446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9358,"joy":0.0139,"surprise":0.0165,"sadness":0.0024,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0115,"disgust":0.0129},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes user intentions toward autonomous public transport (APT) based on their experience with conventional public transport (CPT).

This study proposes a steam-assisted torrefaction pretreatment to address the inefficient utilization of CS and the disposal challenges of MMTs. The experimental results demonstrated that torrefaction at 300 °C with 30% water content for 60 min significantly improved the raw material’s properties. The optimized CSBC exhibited a well-developed pore structure and achieved a phenol removal rate of 63.4%. The addition of MMTs further enhanced the pretreatment effect, increasing the removal rate to 75.5% and confirming the superiority of the CSBC–magnesite composite system.

Specifically, these risks include geopolitical instability, regulatory disparities, socio-cultural conflicts, and economic volatility, which threaten project continuity, economic viability, and sustainability of the BRI framework. Consequently, effective risk recognition and prediction has become crucial for mitigating disruptions and supporting evidence-based policy formulation. What should be noticed is that existing risk management frameworks lack specialized, dynamically adaptive indicator systems capable of forecasting external risks specific to international engineering projects under the BRI. They tend to rely on static and traditional methods, which are ill-equipped to handle the dynamic and nonlinear nature of these transnational challenges. To address this gap, we have developed a machine learning-based early warning system. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset of 31 risk indicators across 155 BRI countries from 2013 to 2022, we constructed a stacked ensemble model optimized via Grid Search. The resulting ensemble model demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, achieving an R2 value of 0.966 and outperforming all baseline methods significantly. By introducing a data-driven early-warning framework, our study contributes to more resilient infrastructure planning and improved risk governance mechanisms in the context of transnational cooperation initiatives.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9089","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.804511","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Changfeng Wang","raw_content_length":1594,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BRI","Research on External Risk Prediction of Belt"],"persons":["BRI"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1584,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Research","External Risk Prediction","Belt and Road Initiative Major Projects","Machine Learning","The Belt and Road Initiative","BRI","its implementation","considerable external risks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability","Machine Learning"],"healthcare_tech":["Research"],"research_academic":["Research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Research":2.0,"External Risk Prediction":2.0,"Belt and Road Initiative Major Projects":2.0,"Machine Learning":2.0,"The Belt and Road Initiative":1.0,"BRI":1.0,"its implementation":1.0,"considerable external risks":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236146328333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5135000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8973,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0821,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0068,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.8766,"anger":0.0151,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the development of a machine learning model for predicting external risks to Belt and Road Initiative projects.

Using panel data from 284 Chinese cities during 2010–2022, this study leverages the climate-resilient city pilot policy as a quasi-natural experiment and applies a double machine learning approach to estimate both the causal impact and underlying mechanisms of this policy on NQPFs. We further examine heterogeneous effects across geographic regions and city types. Our findings show that first, climate-resilient urban development significantly boosts NQPFs, with results remaining robust across multiple sensitivity tests.

Probiotics could help counter polyamide microplastic toxicity while promoting fish health and sustainable aquaculture. A 6-week experiment was conducted on Nile tilapia included four treatments: (1) without polyamide microplastics and/or probiotics (control) and (2) with polyamide microplastics (PA-MP), (3) probiotics (Pr.), or (4) polyamide microplastics and probiotics (PA-MP + Pr.). The outcomes demonstrate that exposure to polyamide microplastics caused poorer growth performance and survivability along with reduced hemoglobin, and upregulated glucose levels, which were restored by probiotics application. The prevalence of erythrocytic abnormalities increased in the polyamide microplastic group but probiotics supplementation reduced the anomalies. Fish exposed to polyamide microplastics exhibited a lower frequency of goblet cells than other groups. Moreover, expression of antioxidant genes (SOD and CAT) and immune genes (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) was higher during polyamide microplastic exposure, which was downregulated in the polyamide microplastics along with probiotics group. These findings suggest that multi-species probiotics relieve microplastic-induced stress and hindrance of growth in Nile tilapia, which will help sustainable aquaculture practices safeguard fish health and maintain aquaculture productivity by alleviating adverse impacts of microplastic pollution in waterbodies.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9085","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.805243","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Md Shahjahan","raw_content_length":1610,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nile"],"persons":[],"locations":["Nile"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1581,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Multi","Nile tilapia","Microplastic particles","multiple toxic effects","physiological processes","fish","Oreochromis niloticus","a widely cultured species"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"Nile tilapia":2.0,"Microplastic particles":1.0,"multiple toxic effects":1.0,"physiological processes":1.0,"fish":1.0,"Oreochromis niloticus":1.0,"a widely cultured species":1.0}},"age_hours":13.23617759638889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1042,"joy":0.0028,"surprise":0.0022,"sadness":0.0174,"fear":0.0317,"anger":0.036,"disgust":0.8057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the use of probiotics to mitigate the negative impacts of microplastics on Nile tilapia.

In response, China has implemented a typical regional cooperation program—East–West Cooperation (EWC). Using a balanced panel of 642 western counties from 2013 to 2020 and the staggered difference-in-differences (DIDs) model, we assess the impact of EWC on the urban–rural income gap. We show that EWC narrows the urban–rural income gap, primarily by increasing rural incomes rather than changing urban incomes. Mechanism analyses indicate that expanded rural employment and higher agricultural production efficiency are the principal channels. The greater the economic disparity and the shorter the distance between paired counties, the stronger the effect of EWC. This effect is particularly pronounced in southwestern assisted counties and in agriculture-intensive assisted counties. The above evidence suggests that horizontal regional cooperation can deliver equity-enhancing growth. Policy should prioritize rural-first resource allocation, employment-oriented labor cooperation, and agricultural upgrading, while refining pairing rules to account for the magnitude of economic gaps and geographic proximity.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9084","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.805623","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Shaopeng Zhang","raw_content_length":1311,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Reduced Inequalities","EWC"],"persons":[],"locations":["East","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1261,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["EWC","Sustainability","Pages","Regional Cooperation","the UrbanRural Income Inequality","Evidence","Chinas EastWest Cooperation Program","the urbanrural income gap","Persistent regional imbalances","hinder progress"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"EWC":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Regional Cooperation":2.0,"the UrbanRural Income Inequality":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"Chinas EastWest Cooperation Program":2.0,"the urbanrural income gap":2.0,"Persistent regional imbalances":1.0,"hinder progress":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236194466944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.1075,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4215,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6649,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0532,"sadness":0.0829,"fear":0.0255,"anger":0.0849,"disgust":0.0791},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article analyzes the impact of China's East-West Cooperation program on urban-rural income inequality.

Climate change exacerbates this issue by intensifying extreme events such as floods, which can enhance contaminant mobility and compromise the reliability of conventional remediation methods. This study evaluated the in situ application of a sustainable soil washing technique based on hydrocycloning at a contaminated site in Canoas (Porto Alegre, Brazil), a flood-prone area heavily impacted by the 2024 climate disaster. The method physically separates heavy metals by concentrating them into a fine, high-contamination fraction for controlled disposal. Approximately 3019 m3 of soil was treated, recovering 93.4% of the material (coarse and fine sand) for potential reuse and isolating only 6.6% (200 m3) as hazardous waste. Chemical analyses confirmed that the recovered fractions complied with regulatory limits for heavy metals, while contaminants were effectively retained in the sludge and safely disposed of through landfills. During the April–May 2024 flood events, although the site was inundated, no significant erosion of the backfilled material was registered. The results support hydrocycloning-based soil washing as a robust and climate-resilient approach to adaptive remediation in contaminated environments.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9083","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.805937","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Graça Brito","raw_content_length":1504,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Porto Alegre"],"locations":["Brazil","Canoas"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1484,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Climate","Soil contamination","heavy metals","industrial and mining activities","a significant global threat","both environmental and human health","brownfields","abandoned or underutilized industrial areas"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Climate":2.0,"Soil contamination":1.0,"heavy metals":1.0,"industrial and mining activities":1.0,"a significant global threat":1.0,"both environmental and human health":1.0,"brownfields":1.0,"abandoned or underutilized industrial areas":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236209141111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.091,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3818,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.19,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0077,"sadness":0.0438,"fear":0.188,"anger":0.1958,"disgust":0.3699},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes the in-situ deployment of a soil washing technique using hydrocycloning to remediate heavy metal contamination in a flood-prone area.

However, the point-of-sale purchase decision is a complex process, influenced not only by ethical arguments but also by sensory cues. This study investigates how the aesthetics (visual design) and materiality (tactile sensation) of green products shape value perception and purchase intention. Using a qualitative methodology based on a focus group, the research directly compares consumer reactions to green products (e.g., a bamboo toothbrush) versus their conventional alternatives (e.g., plastic). Thematic analysis of the data reveals a fundamental dichotomy among consumers: while one segment associates high-tech aesthetics and perfect finishes with quality and hygiene, another segment values natural materials and their “imperfections” as signs of authenticity and responsibility. The results demonstrate that there is no single, universally accepted “sustainable aesthetic” and highlight the need for designers and marketers to align the visual and tactile language of products with the value system of the target consumer segment.

However, existing research falls short in constructing an integrated knowledge framework that systematically clarifies how AI can effectively advance sustainable tourism, leaving theoretical understanding and practical pathways relatively fragmented. To address this gap, this study employs a systematic literature review following the strict SPAR-4-SLR protocol and integrates a domain-based TCCM (i.e., theories, contexts, characteristics, and methods) analysis framework. A total of 177 core articles from the Scopus and Web of Science databases were rigorously analyzed. This study first examines publication trends, key journals, and the citation impact of AI in tourism. It then systematically synthesizes the theoretical foundations, research contexts, characteristics, and methodologies. Most importantly, this review delves into the antecedents, decision-making processes (including mediating and moderating variables), and outcomes of AI applications in the tourism industry. This study not only delineates a clear direction and agenda for future academic inquiry but also provides theoretical support and practical guidance for policymakers and tourism managers to design and implement AI-driven sustainable tourism strategies.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9080","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:08.807078","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Tian Lan","raw_content_length":1480,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TCCM","the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","Scopus"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1480,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Artificial Intelligence","Tourism","A Systematic Literature Review","Future Research Agenda","artificial intelligence AI technology","the tourism sector","-depth","its opportunities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability","Artificial Intelligence","artificial intelligence AI technology"],"research_academic":["Future Research Agenda"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Artificial Intelligence":2.0,"Tourism":2.0,"A Systematic Literature Review":2.0,"Future Research Agenda":2.0,"artificial intelligence AI technology":1.0,"the tourism sector":1.0,"-depth":1.0,"its opportunities":1.0}},"age_hours":13.236269918333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.531,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9062,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8156,"joy":0.0116,"surprise":0.0165,"sadness":0.0113,"fear":0.1135,"anger":0.0184,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is a systematic literature review of AI in tourism and its potential impact on the SDGs.

This study examined associations between AIAT-related perceptions and mental-health indicators (depression, anxiety, and stress) among visually impaired higher education students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A quantitative research approach was employed, using a self-administrated questionnaire targeting 390 visually impaired students in KSA universities. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed as the main data analysis technique. The findings emphasised two important issues. First, performance expectancy (PE) of AIAT adoption, Effort expectancy (EE), and social influence (SI) are forceful psychological facilitators that can buffer against the feeling of depression and anxiety in visually impaired university students. Second, minimising the feeling of stress requires more than the existence of good infrastructure or social support; it necessitates systemic and ongoing interventions, comprising proactive university support, an accessible learning context, and personalised training programmes.

The methodology was assessed through two experimental phases involving a total of 47 participants, examining both tactile recognition accuracy and the perceived realism of the textures. Results demonstrated improved overall performance and reduced variability between textures, suggesting that the approach can provide convincing haptic experiences. The proposed method has potential applications across a wide range of domains, including education, medical simulation, cartography, e-commerce, entertainment, and artistic creation.

Accurate risk stratification enables targeted home care interventions, such as remote monitoring, timely nurse follow-up, and medication adherence programs, designed to mitigate preventable readmissions. Thus, we conducted a systematic comparison of structured electronic health record (EHR) data and unstructured discharge summaries for predicting 30-day unplanned readmissions. Using the MIMIC-IV database, we integrated admissions, emergency department records, laboratory values, and discharge notes, and we restricted the cohort to ED-based readmissions. Following rigorous preprocessing, we balanced the dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets at the patient level. Structured features, including the LACE score (length of stay, acuity of admission, comorbidities, and ED utilization) and triage vitals, were modeled with logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Discharge notes were analyzed with ClinicalLongformer to generate contextual embeddings and with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for few-shot classification. ClinicalLongformer achieved the best discrimination (AUROC = 0.72, F1 = 0.68), outperforming classical ML baselines (AUROC ≈ 0.65–0.67, F1 ≈ 0.64–0.65). The LLM (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) yielded moderate discrimination (AUROC = 0.66, F1 = 0.65) while providing interpretable chain-of-thought rationales. These findings highlight the value of narrative data for risk stratification and suggest that transformer-based language models have the potential to enable scalable, explainable early-warning systems to guide home care and prevent avoidable readmissions.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4033","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:09.631627","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Ao Li","raw_content_length":1767,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Narrative EHR Data","EHR"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":["LACE"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1727,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A Comparative Study","Structured and Narrative EHR Data","Hospital readmissions","30 days","discharge","a key metric","healthcare quality","a major driver"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A Comparative Study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Comparative Study":2.0,"Structured and Narrative EHR Data":2.0,"Hospital readmissions":1.0,"30 days":1.0,"discharge":1.0,"a key metric":1.0,"healthcare quality":1.0,"a major driver":1.0}},"age_hours":13.237214048333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9336,"joy":0.0073,"surprise":0.014,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0236,"anger":0.0105,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on using machine learning to predict hospital readmissions, a key factor in healthcare costs and resource allocation.

A lightweight tracking model based on the Mamba backbone is developed, incorporating a Dilated Wavelet Receptive Field Enhancement Module (DWRFEM) to fuse multi-scale contextual features, significantly mitigating contour fragmentation and feature degradation under severe occlusion. A dual-branch feature optimization architecture is designed, combining the Distilled Tanh Activation with Context (DiTAC) activation function and Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) bottleneck layers to enhance discriminative feature representation. To overcome the limitations of single-UAV perception, a multi-UAV cooperative system is established. Ray intersection is employed to reduce localization uncertainty, while spherical sampling viewpoints are dynamically generated based on obstacle density. Safe trajectory planning is achieved using a Crested Porcupine Optimizer (CPO). Experiments on the Multi-Drone Multi-Target Tracking (MDMT) dataset demonstrate that the model achieves 84.1% average precision (AP) at 95 Frames Per Second (FPS), striking a favorable balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for edge deployment. Field tests with three collaborative UAVs show sustained target coverage in complex environments, outperforming traditional single-UAV approaches.

Initially, the variation characteristics of bus sequence voltages after a fault are utilized to screen suspected fault lines, thereby reducing communication traffic. Subsequently, four basic probability assignment functions are constructed using the polarity of zero-sequence current charge, the polarity of phase-difference current charge, and the starting signals of Zone II/III distance protection from the local and adjacent lines. The confidence of each probability function is evaluated using normalized information entropy, while consistency is analyzed via Gaussian similarity, enabling dynamic allocation of fusion weights. Additionally, a conflict adaptation factor is designed to adjust the fusion strategy dynamically, improving fault tolerance in high-conflict scenarios and mitigating the impact of abnormal single criteria on decision results. Finally, the fused fault probability is used to identify the fault line. Simulation results based on the IEEE 39-bus model demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately identify fault lines under different fault types and locations and remains robust under conditions such as information loss and protection maloperation or failure.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4032","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:09.632230","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Yikai Wang","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1431,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A New Wide","the communication burden","wide-area protection","the fault tolerance","multi-source criteria","this paper","an improved wide-area backup protection method","multi-source information fusion"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A New Wide":2.0,"the communication burden":1.0,"wide-area protection":1.0,"the fault tolerance":1.0,"multi-source criteria":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"an improved wide-area backup protection method":1.0,"multi-source information fusion":1.0}},"age_hours":13.237243810277779,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.1749999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.765,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9413,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.0211,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0127,"disgust":0.0053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for improving wide-area backup protection in power grids, which could lead to faster and more accurate fault detection.

ORIM comprises three modulation schemes: I-QPSK, I-BPSK, and I-π/2 BPSK. They are derived from cyclic offsetting, phase rotation, and interpolation, and applied to QPSK, BPSK, and π/2 BPSK, respectively. Simulation results in discrete Fourier transform-spread-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) systems demonstrate that ORIM achieves a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than the π/2-BPSK scheme specified in the 5G New Radio (NR) protocol, without incurring any performance degradation in terms of block error rate (BLER). Moreover, with the addition of frequency domain spectrum shaping (FDSS), I-π/2 BPSK demonstrates superior performance over π/2-BPSK in both PAPR and BLER metrics under the TDL-A channel conditions. In addition, the complexity of modulation at the transmitting end or demodulation at the receiving end of ORIM is of the same order of magnitude as that of π/2 BPSK, thereby achieving a certain level of overall performance improvement.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4031","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:56:09.632839","language":"en","tags":["electronics","engineering","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Guanghui Yu","raw_content_length":1323,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ORIM","QPSK","PAPR","DFT-s-OFDM","G New Radio"],"persons":["Fourier","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1281,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A New Low PAPR Modulation Scheme","Offset Rotation Interpolation Modulation","ORIM","The article","a novel modulation scheme","a low peak-to-average ratio","PAPR","rotation interpolation modulation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A New Low PAPR Modulation Scheme":2.0,"Offset Rotation Interpolation Modulation":2.0,"ORIM":2.0,"The article":1.0,"a novel modulation scheme":1.0,"a low peak-to-average ratio":1.0,"PAPR":1.0,"rotation interpolation modulation":1.0}},"age_hours":13.2372760675,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9389,"joy":0.0142,"surprise":0.0292,"sadness":0.0024,"fear":0.0033,"anger":0.0073,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a new modulation scheme (ORIM) for 6G wireless communication that aims to reduce power consumption.

The proposed strategy is directly integrated into the inner-loop current controller, requiring no additional compensation modules, predictor structures, or capacitor current feedback, which simplifies the control structure and increases flexibility. The method uses real-time internal state responses of the controller to actively compensate for the phase lag caused by digital control delay, effectively maintaining current control accuracy and overall system dynamic stability. Simulation studies based on a 5.5 kW APF system are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the approach. The results show improved current tracking accuracy, stable dynamic behavior under various load conditions. The simulation-based results indicate the potential of the proposed method for improving control accuracy and stability in digitally controlled APF systems.

Conventional unit commitment (UC) employs static line rating (SLR) and neglects transformer lifetime degradation, posing hidden risks to system security in high-temperature and heavy-load scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a dispatch method that incorporates dynamic line rating (DLR) and transformer life loss under extreme high-temperature conditions. First, the conductor temperature-rise mechanism is formulated using the thermal balance theory, upon which a temperature-dependent DLR calculation model is developed. Second, the coupling relationship between transformer hot-spot temperature, load ratio, and ambient temperature is quantified, and an ambient temperature-driven transformer life cost function is formulated using linear damage accumulation theory. Finally, a unit commitment (UC) optimization model is established to minimize unit generation costs, transformer lifetime loss costs, and wind curtailment penalties costs, while satisfying power balance, transmission capacity, and other operational constraints.
