Existing video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity, narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity, integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11647","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.015393","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Yinan Chen, Jiangning Zhang, Teng Hu, Yuxiang Zeng, Zhucun Xue, Qingdong He, Chengjie Wang, Yong Liu, Xiaobin Hu, Shuicheng Yan","raw_content_length":1428,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IVEBench"],"persons":["Benchmark Suite"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1427,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["IVEBench","Modern Benchmark Suite","Instruction","arXiv251011647v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Instruction-guided video editing","a rapidly advancing research direction","new opportunities","intuitive content transformation","significant challenges"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["a rapidly advancing research direction"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"IVEBench":2.0,"Modern Benchmark Suite":2.0,"Instruction":2.0,"arXiv251011647v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Instruction-guided video editing":1.0,"a rapidly advancing research direction":1.0,"new opportunities":1.0,"intuitive content transformation":1.0,"significant challenges":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760555660277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.194,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6694,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0405,"sadness":0.1768,"fear":0.0545,"anger":0.0321,"disgust":0.0207},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a new benchmark for instruction-guided video editing.

However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting, fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only 9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end. It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm, and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Capturing and annotating large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution.

However, existing evaluations focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap, we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50 expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains, including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and highlights the challenges of Acadreason.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11652","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.016645","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Xin Gui, King Zhu, JinCheng Ren, Qianben Chen, Zekun Moore Wang, Yizhi LI, Xinpeng Liu, Xiaowan Li, Wenli Ren, Linyu Miao, Tianrui Qin, Ziqi Shu, He Zhu, Xiangru Tang, Dingfeng Shi, Jiaheng Liu, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Minghao Liu, Ge Zhang, Wangchunshu Zhou","raw_content_length":1380,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Acadreason","the Limits of Reasoning Models with Academic Research Problems arXiv:2510.11652v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1379,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ACADREASON","the Limits","Reasoning Models","Academic Research Problems","arXiv251011652v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","recent years","the research focus","large language models","LLMs"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Academic Research Problems","the research focus"],"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ACADREASON":2.0,"the Limits":2.0,"Reasoning Models":2.0,"Academic Research Problems":2.0,"arXiv251011652v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"recent years":1.0,"the research focus":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7605997211111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8659,"joy":0.0068,"surprise":0.0409,"sadness":0.0238,"fear":0.0206,"anger":0.024,"disgust":0.018},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on academic reasoning.

However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\\texttt{pass@1024}$), many existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform poorly on MATH-B at $\\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall short on tackling harder instances.

As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically.

While existing methods approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we propose \\emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance. Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11683","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.020587","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Nianyi Lin, Jiajie Zhang, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","raw_content_length":1787,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Boundary arXiv:2510.11683v1 Announce Type"],"persons":["Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1786,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Boundary","arXiv251011683v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","A key challenge","reinforcement learning","large language models","the intractability","their likelihood functions","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["reinforcement learning","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Boundary":2.0,"arXiv251011683v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A key challenge":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"the intractability":1.0,"their likelihood functions":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7607467758333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9182,"joy":0.0099,"surprise":0.041,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0075,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning algorithm (BGPO) to improve the efficiency of large language models, specifically in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

In this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled, representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50% improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model, demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond sharpening.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11686","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.020997","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Jens Tuyls, Dylan J.

To address this gap, we introduce PACEbench, a practical AI cyber-exploitation benchmark built on the principles of realistic vulnerability difficulty, environmental complexity, and cyber defenses. Specifically, PACEbench comprises four scenarios spanning single, blended, chained, and defense vulnerability exploitations. To handle these complex challenges, we propose PACEagent, a novel agent that emulates human penetration testers by supporting multi-phase reconnaissance, analysis, and exploitation. Extensive experiments with seven frontier LLMs demonstrate that current models struggle with complex cyber scenarios, and none can bypass defenses.

While reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution, Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23% in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion for hammer pushing.

Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty, propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance).

With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known, both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\\sqrt{\\log m \\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly, these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11691","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.023015","language":"en","tags":["statml","computer-science","cslg","preprints","csgt","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Taira Tsuchiya","raw_content_length":1580,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Lower Bounds for Optimistic Hedge","Tight Regret Upper","Hedge"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1579,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Tight Regret Upper","Lower Bounds","Optimistic Hedge","arXiv251011691v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","two-player zero-sum games","the learning dynamic","optimistic Hedge","the best-known regret upper bounds","strongly-uncoupled learning dynamics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Tight Regret Upper":2.0,"Lower Bounds":2.0,"Optimistic Hedge":2.0,"arXiv251011691v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"two-player zero-sum games":1.0,"the learning dynamic":1.0,"optimistic Hedge":1.0,"the best-known regret upper bounds":1.0,"strongly-uncoupled learning dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7608375863888885,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3394,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0074,"sadness":0.5911,"fear":0.0038,"anger":0.0264,"disgust":0.0232},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical improvements to an algorithm used in game theory.

Computing geodesics numerically in real-time has become an important capability in several fields, including control and motion planning. The geometric heat flow equation involves solving a parabolic partial differential equation whose solution is a geodesic. In practice, solving this PDE numerically can be done efficiently, and tends to be more numerically stable and exhibit a better rate of convergence compared to numerical optimization. We prove that the geometric heat flow equation is globally exponentially stable in $L_2$ if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is not too positive, and that asymptotic convergence in $L_2$ is always guaranteed. We also present a pseudospectral method that leverages Chebyshev polynomials to accurately compute geodesics in only a few milliseconds for non-contrived manifolds. Our analysis was verified with our custom pseudospectral method by computing geodesics on common non-Euclidean surfaces, and in feedback for a contraction-based controller with a non-flat metric for a nonlinear system.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11692","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.023398","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Samuel G.

This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities.

To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions.

Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency. (iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy. Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6.

To address these concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically, it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for more efficient and robust image classification.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11704","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.026161","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Sarah Harkins Dayton, Hayden Everett, Ioannis Schizas, David L.

In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks. Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning process or non-robust inputs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11709","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.026563","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Edward Stevinson, Lucas Prieto, Melih Barsbey, Tolga Birdal","raw_content_length":1375,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1374,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference","Features","Superposition","neural networks","new Abstract","Fundamental questions","adversarial examples","competing views","them","artifacts"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference":2.0,"Features":2.0,"Superposition":2.0,"neural networks":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Fundamental questions":1.0,"adversarial examples":1.0,"competing views":1.0,"them":1.0,"artifacts":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7609688730555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":0.64,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.872,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8619,"joy":0.0089,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0088,"fear":0.0462,"anger":0.0361,"disgust":0.0161},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents research on adversarial vulnerabilities in neural networks, specifically how superposition can be exploited.

We state a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11711","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.026953","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Sanghyeok Choi, Sarthak Mittal, V\\'ictor Elvira, Jinkyoo Park, Nikolay Malkin","raw_content_length":1345,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SMC"],"persons":["wherein learnt","Monte Carlo","MaxEnt RL"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1344,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reinforced sequential Monte Carlo","amortised sampling","arXiv251011711v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","a synergy","amortised and particle-based methods","distributions","unnormalised density functions","a connection"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reinforced sequential Monte Carlo":2.0,"amortised sampling":2.0,"arXiv251011711v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a synergy":1.0,"amortised and particle-based methods":1.0,"distributions":1.0,"unnormalised density functions":1.0,"a connection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760983578888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.849,"joy":0.0494,"surprise":0.0747,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0109,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for improving sampling from complex distributions, which could potentially improve the efficiency of simulations used in materials science and drug discovery, indirectly impacting sustainability by accelerating research.

For the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics.

While generally true for short-term tasks, the \"frozen world\" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness: even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes, including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where performance degrades while incorporating updated information.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11713","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.027777","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Tsung-Han Wu, Mihran Miroyan, David M.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_96b8d38d0241","title":"CodePlot","content":"arXiv:2510.11718v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance, such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems. Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for \"thinking with images\" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as \"visual thought\", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems.

As the day passes, the number of COVID- 19 cases increases, and online platforms and a few news portals entertain sharing different conspiracy theories. The most popular conspiracy belief was the link between the 5G network spreading COVID-19 and the Chinese government spreading the virus as a bioweapon, which initially created racial hatred. Although some disbelief has less impact on society, others create massive destruction. For example, the 5G conspiracy led to the burn of the 5G Tower, and belief in the Chinese bioweapon story promoted an attack on the Asian-Americans. Another popular conspiracy belief was that Bill Gates spread this Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by launching a mass vaccination program to track everyone. This Conspiracy belief creates distrust issues among laypeople and creates vaccine hesitancy. This study aims to discover the conspiracy theory against the vaccine on social platforms. We performed a sentiment analysis on the 598 unique sample comments related to COVID-19 vaccines. We used two different models, BERT and Perspective API, to find out the sentiment and toxicity of the sentence toward the COVID-19 vaccine.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13003","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.029366","language":"en","tags":["cslg","cscy","csai","preprints","research","cscl","computer-science","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Md Hasibul Amin (University Of Houston), Harika Madanu (University Of Houston), Sahithi Lavu (University Of Houston), Hadi Mansourifar (University Of Houston), Dana Alsagheer (University Of Houston), Weidong Shi (University Of Houston)","raw_content_length":1341,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["COVID-19","Coronavirus"],"persons":["Conspiracy","COVID-19","Announce Type","Bill Gates"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1340,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Conspiracy Theory","COVID","arXiv221113003v1 Announce Type","cross","the beginning","the vaccination trial","social media","anti-vaccination comments and conspiracy beliefs","the day","the number"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Conspiracy Theory":2.0,"COVID":2.0,"arXiv221113003v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"the beginning":1.0,"the vaccination trial":1.0,"social media":1.0,"anti-vaccination comments and conspiracy beliefs":1.0,"the day":1.0,"the number":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761074373333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2524999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7495,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8677,"joy":0.0122,"surprise":0.0543,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0277,"anger":0.0299,"disgust":0.0033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on detecting conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 vaccines using sentiment analysis.

We consider the two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable, and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09632","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.031940","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","physicsgeo-ph","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Vahid Negahdari, Shirin Samadi Bahrami, Seyed Reza Moghadasi, Mohammad Reza Razvan","raw_content_length":1515,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Generative Adversarial Networks","CNN","Challenges arXiv:2510.09632v1 Announce Type: cross","Variational Autoencoders"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1514,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Performance","Machine Learning Methods","Gravity Inversion","Successes","Challenges","Announce Type","Gravity inversion","the problem","subsurface density distributions","observed gravitational field data"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine Learning Methods"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Performance":2.0,"Machine Learning Methods":2.0,"Gravity Inversion":2.0,"Successes":2.0,"Challenges":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Gravity inversion":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"subsurface density distributions":1.0,"observed gravitational field data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7611628241666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8342,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0335,"sadness":0.0387,"fear":0.0187,"anger":0.0337,"disgust":0.0317},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores machine learning methods for gravity inversion, which could potentially improve resource exploration and geological understanding.

Monitoring chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation. Traditional in situ measurements are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable, long-term, and transferable monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage, by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map Chl-a across the water column of the Mar Menor. The work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Nearly a decade of Sentinel 2 images was atmospherically corrected using C2RCC processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth (0-1 m, 1-2 m, 2-3 m, 3-4 m). Multiple ML and DL algorithms-including RF, XGBoost, CatBoost, Multilater Perceptron Networks, and ensembles-were trained and validated using cross-validation. Systematic band-combination experiments and spatial aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. Results show depth-dependent performance. At the surface, C2X-Complex with XGBoost and ensemble models achieved R2 = 0.89; at 1-2 m, CatBoost and ensemble models reached R2 = 0.87; at 2-3 m, TOA reflectances with KNN performed best (R2 = 0.81); while at 3-4 m, RF achieved R2 = 0.66. Generated maps successfully reproduced known eutrophication events (e.g., 2016 crisis, 2025 surge), confirming robustness. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology for depth-specific Chl-amapping. Its integration of multispectral band combinations, buoy calibration, and ML/DL modeling offers a transferable framework for other turbid coastal systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09736","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.033547","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","computer-science","csai","physicsao-ph","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":264,"author":"Antonio Mart\\'inez-Ibarra, Aurora Gonz\\'alez-Vidal, Adri\\'an C\\'anovas-Rodr\\'iguez, Antonio F.

We obtain the volume and measure of small metric ball in PUn and derive the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds in PUn. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds for the kissing radius of the codebooks in PUn as a function of the minimum distance. Using the lower bound of the kissing radius, we find a tight Hamming bound. Also, we establish bounds on the distortion-rate function for quantizing a source uniformly distributed over PUn. As example codebooks in PUn, we consider the projective Pauli and Clifford groups, as well as the projective group of diagonal gates in the Clifford hierarchy, and find their minimum distances. For any code in PUn with given cardinality we provide a lower bound of covering radius.

Here, I demonstrate that modern large language models (LLMs) and autonomous coding agents can dramatically lower this barrier through a process called 'vibe coding', an iterative, conversational style of software creation where users describe goals in natural language and AI agents generate, test, and refine executable code in real-time. As a proof of concept, I used Vibe coding to create a fully functional proteomics data analysis website capable of performing standard tasks, including data normalization, differential expression testing, and volcano plot visualization. The entire application, including user interface, backend logic, and data upload pipeline, was developed in less than ten minutes using only four natural-language prompts, without any manual coding, at a cost of under $2. Previous works in this area typically require tens of thousands of dollars in research effort from highly trained programmers. I detail the step-by-step generation process and evaluate the resulting code's functionality. This demonstration highlights how vibe coding enables domain experts to rapidly prototype sophisticated analytical tools, transforming the pace and accessibility of computational biology software development.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09804","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.034338","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","q-bioot","preprints","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Jesse G.

The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many quantum algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum circuits for this algorithm implementing on quantum devices with restrictions. Many quantum devices (for example, based on superconductors) have restrictions on applying two-qubit gates. These restrictions are presented by a qubit connectivity graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architecture of the qubit connection, but current devices have more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit for implementing on such architecture. We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with existing quantum circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, ``sun'' (a cycle with tails, presented by the 16-qubit IBMQ device) and ``two joint suns'' (two joint cycles with tails, presented by the 27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with existing optimized circuits for ``sun'' and ``two joint suns'' architectures, and a circuit with slightly more CNOT gates for the LNN architecture. At the same time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected graphs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09824","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.034768","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","csds","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Kamil Khadiev, Aliya Khadieva, Vadim Sagitov, Kamil Khasanov","raw_content_length":1443,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum Circuit","QFT","LNN","the Quantum Fourier Transform"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1440,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantum Circuit","Quantum Fourier Transform","Arbitrary Qubit Connectivity Graphs","quantum circuits","restrictions","arXiv251009824v1","Announce Type","cross","the paper","the Quantum Fourier Transform"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantum Circuit":2.0,"Quantum Fourier Transform":2.0,"Arbitrary Qubit Connectivity Graphs":2.0,"quantum circuits":2.0,"restrictions":2.0,"arXiv251009824v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"the paper":1.0,"the Quantum Fourier Transform":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7612688,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.377000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4754,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8338,"joy":0.0594,"surprise":0.086,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0024,"anger":0.0102,"disgust":0.003},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method for optimizing quantum circuits, specifically the Quantum Fourier Transform, on quantum devices with restricted qubit connectivity.

We study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\\\"older-smooth missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by matching lower bounds.

For qubits ($d = 2$), our result implies that if an $n$-qubit gate set is eventually universal, then it will exhibit universality when acting on a $16n$ qubit system, as opposed to the previous bound of a $256n$ qubit system. In other words, if adding just $15n$ ancillary qubits to a quantum system (as opposed to the previous bound of $255 n$ ancillary qubits) does not boost a gate set to universality, then no number of ancillary qubits ever will.

More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.037462","language":"en","tags":["cslg","preprints","research","q-bionc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Xiao-Xiong Lin, Yuk Hoi Yiu, Christian Leibold","raw_content_length":1727,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.14,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hippocampal Sequences"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1726,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Egocentric Visual Navigation","Hippocampal Sequences","arXiv251009951v1 Announce Type","cross","Sequential activation","place-tuned neurons","an animal","navigation","the sequence","input"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Egocentric Visual Navigation":2.0,"Hippocampal Sequences":2.0,"arXiv251009951v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Sequential activation":1.0,"place-tuned neurons":1.0,"an animal":1.0,"navigation":1.0,"the sequence":1.0,"input":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761371088611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8901,"joy":0.0235,"surprise":0.0456,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0095,"anger":0.012,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI architecture for navigation using sparse inputs, inspired by hippocampal sequences.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0ff38cb27d39","title":"Generative Latent Video Compression","content":"arXiv:2510.09987v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression, where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression. GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints from the rate-distortion optimization.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f1dc61e5c222","title":"Distributionally Robust Control with End","content":"arXiv:2510.10214v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems. However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate. Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness compared against state-of-the-art methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10214","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.040209","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","csai","cssy","preprints","research","mathoc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Jingyi Wu, Chao Ning, Yang Shi","raw_content_length":1970,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DRC"],"persons":["Wasserstein"],"locations":["Wasserstein"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1969,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Distributionally Robust Control","End","arXiv251010214v1 Announce Type","cross","Wasserstein distributionally robust control","DRC","a principled paradigm","uncertainty","stochastic dynamical systems","uniform distribution shifts"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["uncertainty"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Distributionally Robust Control":2.0,"End":2.0,"arXiv251010214v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Wasserstein distributionally robust control":1.0,"DRC":1.0,"a principled paradigm":1.0,"uncertainty":1.0,"stochastic dynamical systems":1.0,"uniform distribution shifts":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7614677275,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7808,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.027,"sadness":0.0132,"fear":0.1016,"anger":0.0295,"disgust":0.0426},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel control framework that aims to improve the efficiency and robustness of control policies in stochastic dynamical systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_633c028c5f3e","title":"Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty propagation","content":"arXiv:2510.10268v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier (upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes, achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model. In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution, quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than parametric variational cut approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10268","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.041017","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","statme","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Jiafang Song, Sandipan Pramanik, Abhirup Datta","raw_content_length":1909,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NeVI-Cut"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1908,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["feedback","Neural variational inference","uncertainty propagation","arXiv251010268v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","many scientific applications","uncertainty","estimates","an earlier upstream analysis"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["uncertainty propagation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"feedback":4.0,"Neural variational inference":2.0,"uncertainty propagation":2.0,"arXiv251010268v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"many scientific applications":1.0,"uncertainty":1.0,"estimates":1.0,"an earlier upstream analysis":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7614970322222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.0604999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3879,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8967,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0228,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0235,"anger":0.0259,"disgust":0.0202},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new method (NeVI-Cut) for uncertainty propagation in Bayesian analysis, potentially improving the accuracy and computational efficiency of scientific modeling.

Addressing these challenges requires methods that distill complex aerosol properties into compact yet physically meaningful forms. Generative autoencoder models provide such a pathway. We present a framework for learning deep variational autoencoder (VAE) models of speciated mass and number concentration distributions, which capture detailed aerosol size-composition characteristics. By compressing hundreds of original dimensions into ten latent variables, the approach enables efficient storage and processing while preserving the fidelity of key diagnostics, including cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) spectra, optical scattering and absorption coefficients, and ice nucleation properties. Results show that CCN spectra are easiest to reconstruct accurately, optical properties are moderately difficult, and ice nucleation properties are the most challenging. To improve performance, we introduce a preprocessing optimization strategy that avoids repeated retraining and yields latent representations resilient to high-magnitude Gaussian noise, boosting accuracy for CCN spectra, optical coefficients, and frozen fraction spectra. Finally, we propose a novel realism metric -- based on the sliced Wasserstein distance between generated samples and a held-out test set -- for optimizing the KL divergence weight in VAEs.

The overlap of signal components in the time-frequency domain poses a significant challenge for signal analysis. One approach to addressing this problem is to introduce an additional chirprate parameter and use the chirplet transform (CT) to elevate the two-dimensional time-frequency representation to a three-dimensional time-frequency-chirprate representation. From a certain point of view, the CT of a signal can be regarded as a windowed special linear canonical transform of that signal, undergoing a shift and a modulation. In this paper, we develop this idea to propose a novel windowed linear canonical transform (WLCT), which provides a new time-frequency-chirprate representation. We discuss four types of WLCTs. In addition, we use a special X-ray transform to further sharpen the time-frequency-chirprate representation. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding three-dimensional synchrosqueezed transform, demonstrating that the WLCTs have great potential for three-dimensional signal separation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10438","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.043347","language":"en","tags":["eesssp","preprints","research","csna","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Shuixin Li, Jiecheng Chen, Qingtang Jiang, Jian Lu","raw_content_length":1164,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear canonical transform"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1161,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Synchrosqueezed windowed linear canonical transform","A method","mode retrieval","multicomponent signals","instantaneous frequencies","arXiv251010438v1 Announce Type","cross","nature","signals","the form"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Synchrosqueezed windowed linear canonical transform":2.0,"A method":2.0,"mode retrieval":2.0,"multicomponent signals":2.0,"instantaneous frequencies":2.0,"arXiv251010438v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"nature":1.0,"signals":1.0,"the form":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761585478611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.721,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2558,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7145,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0222,"sadness":0.0104,"fear":0.1667,"anger":0.0468,"disgust":0.0336},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel signal processing method.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e2b35ef34f63","title":"Towards Efficient 3D Gaussian Human Avatar Compression: A Prior","content":"arXiv:2510.10492v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10492","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.043763","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","computer-science","preprints","cscv","csmm","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Shanzhi Yin, Bolin Chen, Xinju Wu, Ru-Ling Liao, Jie Chen, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye","raw_content_length":1444,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1443,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Efficient 3D Gaussian Human Avatar Compression","Announce Type","Abstract","This paper","an efficient 3D avatar coding framework","compact human priors","target","high-quality 3D human avatar video compression","ultra-low bit rates","The framework"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Efficient 3D Gaussian Human Avatar Compression":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"an efficient 3D avatar coding framework":1.0,"compact human priors":1.0,"target":1.0,"high-quality 3D human avatar video compression":1.0,"ultra-low bit rates":1.0,"The framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7616006080555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9079,"joy":0.0464,"surprise":0.0205,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0099,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method for compressing 3D human avatar video at ultra-low bit rates, which could reduce the energy consumption associated with transmitting and storing such data.
