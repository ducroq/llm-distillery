The efficiency of the proposed method is built upon four essential components: (i) a martingale formulation of the forward backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE); (ii) a small scale stochastic particle method for local linear regression (LLR); (iii) a decoupling strategy with a matrix-free solver for the weighted least-squares system used to compute $\\nabla u$; (iv) a Newton iteration for solving the univariate nonlinear system in $u$. Unlike traditional deterministic methods that rely on global information, this localized computational scheme not only provides explicit pointwise evaluations of $u$ and $\\nabla u$ but, more importantly, is naturally suited for parallelization across particles. In addition, the algorithm avoids the need for spatial meshes and global basis functions required by classical deterministic approaches, as well as the derivative-dependent and lengthy training procedures often encountered in machine learning. More importantly, we rigorously analyze the error bound of the proposed scheme, which is fully explicit in both the particle number $M$ and the time step size $\\Delta t$. Numerical results conducted for problem dimensions ranging from $d=100$ to $d=10000$ consistently verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. Remarkably, all computations are carried out efficiently on a standard personal computer, without requiring any specialized hardware. These results confirm that the proposed method is built upon a principled design that not only extends the practically solvable range of ultra-high-dimensional PDEs but also maintains rigorous error control and ease of implementation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02635","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.300393","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Shuixin Fang, Changtao Sheng, Bihao Su, Tao Zhou","raw_content_length":1856,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLR"],"persons":["\\nabla","Announce Type"],"locations":["Newton"],"monetary":["$u$.

Experiments often discover a diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally non-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity, resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in neural networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02765","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.301946","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Hugo Ninou, Jonathan Kadmon, N.

Among these attacks, finetuning-based ones that compromise LLMs' safety alignment via fine-tuning stand out due to its stable jailbreak performance. In particular, a recent study indicates that fine-tuning with as few as 10 harmful question-answer (QA) pairs can lead to successful jailbreaking across various harmful questions. However, such malicious fine-tuning attacks are readily detectable and hence thwarted by moderation models. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can be jailbroken by fine-tuning with only 10 benign QA pairs; our attack exploits the increased sensitivity of LLMs to fine-tuning data after being overfitted. Specifically, our fine-tuning process starts with overfitting an LLM via fine-tuning with benign QA pairs involving identical refusal answers. Further fine-tuning is then performed with standard benign answers, causing the overfitted LLM to forget the refusal attitude and thus provide compliant answers regardless of the harmfulness of a question. We implement our attack on the ten LLMs and compare it with five existing baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in both attack effectiveness and attack stealth. Our findings expose previously unreported security vulnerabilities in current LLMs and provide a new perspective on understanding how LLMs' security is compromised, even with benign fine-tuning.

However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.303107","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Shiyi Zhang, Dong Liang, Hairong Zheng, Yihang Zhou","raw_content_length":1196,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Image Reconstruction","HAVIR:","Semantic Extractor","HierArchical Vision","HAVIR","CLIP"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1195,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HAVIR","HierArchical Vision","Image Reconstruction","CLIP","arXiv251003122v2","Announce Type","Abstract","The reconstruction","visual information","brain activity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["brain activity"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HAVIR":2.0,"HierArchical Vision":2.0,"Image Reconstruction":2.0,"CLIP":2.0,"arXiv251003122v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The reconstruction":1.0,"visual information":1.0,"brain activity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7711485416666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.339,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4678,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8557,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.0505,"sadness":0.0156,"fear":0.041,"anger":0.0139,"disgust":0.0076},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI model (HAVIR) for reconstructing visual information from brain activity.

Based on the no-cloning theorem, perfect cribbing is impossible. This leads to the introduction of a MAC model with noisy cribbing. In the causal and non-causal cribbing scenarios, Transmitter 2 performs the measurement before the input of Transmitter 1 is sent through the channel. Hence, Transmitter 2's cribbing may inflict a \"state collapse\" for Transmitter 1. Achievable regions are derived for each setting. Furthermore, a regularized capacity characterization is established for robust cribbing, i.e. when the cribbing system contains all the information of the channel input. Building on the analogy between the noisy cribbing model and the relay channel, a partial decode-forward region is derived for a quantum MAC with non-robust cribbing. For the classical-quantum MAC with cribbing encoders, the capacity region is determined with perfect cribbing of the classical input, and a cutset region is derived for noisy cribbing. In the special case of a classical-quantum MAC with a deterministic cribbing channel, the inner and outer bounds coincide.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15589","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.344566","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","preprints","mathit","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Uzi Pereg, Christian Deppe, Holger Boche","raw_content_length":1309,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MAC","The Quantum Multiple arXiv:2111.15589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross"],"persons":["Transmitter 2's"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1308,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Transmitter","The Quantum Multiple","arXiv211115589v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Communication","a quantum multiple-access channel","MAC","cribbing encoders","a measurement","a system"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MAC"],"healthcare_tech":["MAC"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Transmitter":3.0,"The Quantum Multiple":2.0,"arXiv211115589v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Communication":1.0,"a quantum multiple-access channel":1.0,"MAC":1.0,"cribbing encoders":1.0,"a measurement":1.0,"a system":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7726614716666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6277,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0358,"sadness":0.0162,"fear":0.1349,"anger":0.0957,"disgust":0.0831},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores theoretical communication limits in quantum multiple-access channels.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_901f95445918","title":"Speech Enhancement and Dereverberation with Diffusion","content":"arXiv:2208.05830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In this work, we build upon our previous publication and use diffusion-based generative models for speech enhancement. We present a detailed overview of the diffusion process that is based on a stochastic differential equation and delve into an extensive theoretical examination of its implications. Opposed to usual conditional generation tasks, we do not start the reverse process from pure Gaussian noise but from a mixture of noisy speech and Gaussian noise. This matches our forward process which moves from clean speech to noisy speech by including a drift term. We show that this procedure enables using only 30 diffusion steps to generate high-quality clean speech estimates. By adapting the network architecture, we are able to significantly improve the speech enhancement performance, indicating that the network, rather than the formalism, was the main limitation of our original approach. In an extensive cross-dataset evaluation, we show that the improved method can compete with recent discriminative models and achieves better generalization when evaluating on a different corpus than used for training. We complement the results with an instrumental evaluation using real-world noisy recordings and a listening experiment, in which our proposed method is rated best. Examining different sampler configurations for solving the reverse process allows us to balance the performance and computational speed of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that the proposed method is also suitable for dereverberation and thus not limited to additive background noise removal.

This is a model for stationary time series which can be extended to allow the presence of a deterministic trend in each series. Detrending the data either parametrically or nonparametrically before fitting the VAR model gives rise to more errors in the latter part. In this study, we propose a new approach called DeepVARwT that employs deep learning methodology for maximum likelihood estimation of the trend and the dependence structure at the same time. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used for this purpose. To ensure the stability of the model, we enforce the causality condition on the autoregressive coefficients using the transformation of Ansley & Kohn (1986). We provide a simulation study and an application to real data. In the simulation study, we use realistic trend functions generated from real data and compare the estimates with true function/parameter values. In the real data application, we compare the prediction performance of this model with state-of-the-art models in the literature.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10587","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.345385","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","statme","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Xixi Li, Jingsong Yuan","raw_content_length":1197,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VAR","Ansley & Kohn"],"persons":["Deep Learning"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1196,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DeepVARwT","Deep Learning","a VAR Model","Trend","replace-cross Abstract","The vector autoregressive VAR model","the dependence","multiple time series","a model","stationary time series"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DeepVARwT":3.0,"Deep Learning":2.0,"a VAR Model":2.0,"Trend":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The vector autoregressive VAR model":1.0,"the dependence":1.0,"multiple time series":1.0,"a model":1.0,"stationary time series":1.0}},"age_hours":2.772692191388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2006,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9023,"joy":0.0042,"surprise":0.0414,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.0196,"anger":0.015,"disgust":0.008},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new deep learning method (DeepVARwT) for time series analysis, which could potentially improve the accuracy of forecasting models used in various sustainability applications.

Sci. 2002), and the compressed oracle method by Zhandry (CRYPTO 2019) have been shown to be powerful in proving quantum query lower bounds for a wide variety of problems. In this paper, we propose a new method for proving quantum query lower bounds by a quantum sample-to-query lifting theorem, which is from an information theory perspective. Using this method, we obtain the following new results: 1. A quadratic relation between quantum sample and query complexities regarding quantum property testing, which is optimal and saturated by quantum state discrimination. Here, the sample complexity is measured given sample access to the quantum state to be tested, while the query complexity is measured given query access to an oracle that block-encodes the quantum state. 2. A matching lower bound $\\widetilde \\Omega(\\beta)$ for quantum Gibbs sampling at inverse temperature $\\beta$, showing that the quantum Gibbs sampler by Gily\\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe (STOC 2019) is optimal. 3. A new lower bound $\\widetilde \\Omega(1/\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ for the entanglement entropy problem with gap $\\Delta$, which was recently studied by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023). 4. A series of quantum query lower bounds for matrix spectrum testing, based on the sample lower bounds for quantum state spectrum testing by O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015, Comm. Math. Phys. 2021). In addition, we also provide unified proofs for some known lower bounds that have been proven previously via different techniques, including those for phase/amplitude estimation and Hamiltonian simulation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01794","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.345828","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","preprints","cscc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang","raw_content_length":1770,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.345,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum Lower Bounds","J.

Such a set $C$ is often referred to as a code in the literature of identification problems.

We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination and call the resulting codes full-separating dominating codes (or FD-codes for short) and full-separating total-dominating codes (or FTD-codes for short), respectively. Incidentally, FTD-codes have also been introduced in the literature of identification problems under the name of strongly identifying codes (or SID-codes for short) and under a differently formulated definition. In this paper, we address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size, their relation to codes of the other types and present some extremal cases for these bounds and relations. We further show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph are NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes of any graph differ by at most one, but that it is NP-hard to decide whether or not they are equal for a given graph in general.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10595","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.348136","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csdm","mathco","preprints","cscc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Dipayan Chakraborty, Annegret K.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0cbe0e203f9a","title":"Generalization Bounds of Surrogate Policies for Combinatorial Optimization Problems","content":"arXiv:2407.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A recent line of structured learning methods has advanced the practical state-of-the-art for combinatorial optimization problems with complex, application-specific objectives. These approaches learn policies that couple a statistical model with a tractable surrogate combinatorial optimization oracle, so as to exploit the distribution of problem instances instead of solving each instance independently. A core obstacle is that the empirical risk is then piecewise constant in the model parameters. This hinders gradient-based optimization and only few theoretical guarantees have been provided so far. We address this issue by analyzing smoothed (perturbed) policies: adding controlled random perturbations to the direction used by the linear oracle yields a differentiable surrogate risk and improves generalization. Our main contribution is a generalization bound that decomposes the excess risk into perturbation bias, statistical estimation error, and optimization error. The analysis hinges on a new Uniform Weak (UW) property capturing the geometric interaction between the statistical model and the normal fan of the feasible polytope; we show it holds under mild assumptions, and automatically when a minimal baseline perturbation is present. The framework covers, in particular, contextual stochastic optimization.

Unlike most existing works try to improve the task accuracy through architectural or algorithmic innovations, we tackle this task from image quality assessment (IQA) perspective, an under-explored direction in the field. Due to the limitations of conventional metrics such as l1 in capturing the nuanced differences in reconstructed images for medical anomaly detection, we propose fusion quality, a novel metric that wisely integrates the structure-level sensitivity of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) with the pixel-level precision of l1. The metric offers a more comprehensive assessment of reconstruction quality, considering intensity (subtractive property of l1 and divisive property of SSIM), contrast, and structural similarity. Furthermore, the proposed metric makes subtle regional variations more impactful in the final assessment. Thus, considering the inherent divisive properties of SSIM, we design an average intensity ratio (AIR)-based data transformation that amplifies the divisive discrepancies between normal and abnormal regions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection. By fusing the aforementioned two components, we devise the IQA approach. Experimental results on two distinct brain MRI datasets show that our IQA approach significantly enhances medical anomaly detection performance when integrated with state-of-the-art baselines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08228","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.348958","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","computer-science","preprints","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Zixuan Pan, Jun Xia, Zheyu Yan, Guoyue Xu, Yifan Qin, Xueyang Li, Yawen Wu, Zhenge Jia, Jianxu Chen, Yiyu Shi","raw_content_length":1563,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Structural Similarity","An Image Quality Assessment Perspective","Rethinking Medical Anomaly Detection","Brain"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1562,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Medical Anomaly Detection","Brain MRI","arXiv240808228v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Reconstruction-based methods","particularly those leveraging autoencoders","anomaly detection task","brain MRI","most existing works","the task accuracy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Brain MRI"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Medical Anomaly Detection":2.0,"Brain MRI":2.0,"arXiv240808228v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Reconstruction-based methods":1.0,"particularly those leveraging autoencoders":1.0,"anomaly detection task":1.0,"brain MRI":1.0,"most existing works":1.0,"the task accuracy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7728279358333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8847,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0445,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.032,"anger":0.0128,"disgust":0.0086},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel image quality assessment metric for brain MRI anomaly detection.

We consider an $\\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator for this problem which is known to have favorable statistical properties but is computationally challenging to solve, especially for medium-sized Bayesian networks. We propose a new coordinate descent algorithm to approximate this estimator and prove several remarkable properties of our procedure: the algorithm converges to a coordinate-wise minimum, and despite the non-convexity of the loss function, as the sample size tends to infinity, the objective value of the coordinate descent solution converges to the optimal objective value of the $\\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimator. Finite-sample statistical consistency guarantees are also established. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first coordinate descent procedure endowed with optimality and statistical guarantees in the context of learning Bayesian networks.

However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities.

Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\\{\\mathbf{W}_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \\to \\infty$ with $n / d^2 \\to \\tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\\Delta=\\kappa \\sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\\tau_1(\\kappa)$: for $\\tau < \\tau_1(\\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\\tau > \\tau_1(\\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\\tau_2(\\kappa)$, such that for $\\tau>\\tau_2(\\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \\Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\\tau,\\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17887","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.351379","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","csdm","mathco","preprints","research","cond-matdis-nn","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":284,"author":"Antoine Maillard","raw_content_length":1978,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.42,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["perceptron in statistical physics","\\sqrt{n}$"],"persons":["Zhang","Matrix Spencer","Kunisky","\\|\\sum_{i=1}^n"],"locations":["\\infty$"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1977,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv241017887v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","a sequence","d times d symmetric matrices","mathbfW_i_i1n","a margin Delta","signs","dots","epsilon_n in pm 1n","the operator norm"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv241017887v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"a sequence":1.0,"d times d symmetric matrices":1.0,"mathbfW_i_i1n":1.0,"a margin Delta":1.0,"signs":1.0,"dots":1.0,"epsilon_n in pm 1n":1.0,"the operator norm":1.0}},"age_hours":2.772916428611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.582,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0836,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8022,"joy":0.0307,"surprise":0.1445,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0037,"anger":0.0093,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the theoretical possibility of balancing random matrices, which could potentially be applied to optimize energy systems or resource allocation.

To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 8 to 32 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.351800","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","preprints","cscv","research","q-bioqm","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Yaxuan Song, Jianan Fan, Heng Huang, Mei Chen, Weidong Cai","raw_content_length":1578,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Point","CAP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1577,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cell","Point","CAP","arXiv241114833v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches","detection","segmentation","each frame","a prerequisite"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["Cell"],"business_innovation":["CAP"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cell":3.0,"Point":3.0,"CAP":2.0,"arXiv241114833v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches":1.0,"detection":1.0,"segmentation":1.0,"each frame":1.0,"a prerequisite":1.0}},"age_hours":2.772931112222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9199,"joy":0.0095,"surprise":0.0467,"sadness":0.0044,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0102,"disgust":0.0043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel cell tracking method (CAP) that is claimed to be 8 to 32 times more efficient than existing methods.

Specifically, we derive new mixing time bounds for the projected LA which are, in some important cases, dimension-free and poly-logarithmic on the accuracy, closely matching the existing results in the smooth convex case. Additionally, we establish new upper bounds for the privacy curve of the subsampled noisy SGD algorithm. These bounds show a crucial dependency on the regularity of gradients, and are useful for a wide range of convex losses beyond the smooth case. Our analysis relies on a suitable extension of the Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI) framework (Feldman et al., 2018; Altschuler and Talwar, 2022, 2023) to noisy iterations whose gradient map is not necessarily nonexpansive.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_de66efac1921","title":"Any","content":"arXiv:2502.04889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The gradient descent (GD) has been one of the most common optimizer in machine learning. In particular, the loss landscape of a neural network is typically sharpened during the initial phase of training, making the training dynamics hover on the edge of stability. This is beyond our standard understanding of GD convergence in the stable regime where arbitrarily chosen stepsize is sufficiently smaller than the edge of stability. Recently, Wu et al. (COLT2024) have showed that GD converges with arbitrary stepsize under linearly separable logistic regression. Although their analysis hinges on the self-bounding property of the logistic loss, which seems to be a cornerstone to establish a modified descent lemma, our pilot study shows that other loss functions without the self-bounding property can make GD converge with arbitrary stepsize. To further understand what property of a loss function matters in GD, we aim to show arbitrary-stepsize GD convergence for a general loss function based on the framework of \\emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. We essentially leverage the classical perceptron argument to derive the convergence rate for achieving $\\epsilon$-optimal loss, which is possible for a majority of Fenchel--Young losses. Among typical loss functions, the Tsallis entropy achieves the GD convergence rate $T=\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$, and the R{\\'e}nyi entropy achieves the far better rate $T=\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$. We argue that these better rate is possible because of \\emph{separation margin} of loss functions, instead of the self-bounding property.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04889","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.353017","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Han Bao, Shinsaku Sakaue, Yuki Takezawa","raw_content_length":1628,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.165,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1627,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Any","the edge","stability","replace-cross Abstract","The gradient descent","the most common optimizer","machine learning","the loss landscape","a neural network","the initial phase"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["machine learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Any":2.0,"the edge":2.0,"stability":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The gradient descent":1.0,"the most common optimizer":1.0,"machine learning":1.0,"the loss landscape":1.0,"a neural network":1.0,"the initial phase":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7729780469444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.9145,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5829,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8964,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.0547,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0154,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on gradient descent optimization algorithms, specifically focusing on convergence rates for different loss functions.

Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions yet also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime -- an apparent contradiction lacking a unified explanation. Here we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time ($t$) since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$, with $H$ constant. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process with cumulative advantage, modelled as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and volatility. We show that antipersistent fluctuations in attention ($H < 1/2$) yield log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent attention dynamics ($H > 1/2$) favour heavy-tailed power laws, thus resolving the log-normal--power-law contradiction. Numerical simulations confirm both the $t^{H}$ law and the transition between regimes. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints indicates that the latent attention process is intrinsically antipersistent ($H \\approx 0.13$). By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations in attention to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03011","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.353867","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","csdl","preprints","research","cond-matstat-mech","computer-science","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Keisuke Okamura","raw_content_length":1698,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["as $t^{H}$"]},"char_count":1697,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["citation dynamics","Fractional stochastic model","memory","volatility","arXiv250303011v2","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","the statistical laws","a fundamental challenge","network theory"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"citation dynamics":3.0,"Fractional stochastic model":2.0,"memory":2.0,"volatility":2.0,"arXiv250303011v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the statistical laws":1.0,"a fundamental challenge":1.0,"network theory":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7730066102777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4649,"joy":0.0077,"surprise":0.0384,"sadness":0.0161,"fear":0.3591,"anger":0.0751,"disgust":0.0387},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical model for understanding citation dynamics, which could indirectly inform strategies for promoting sustainable research and development.

This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.354292","language":"en","tags":["mathag","mathco","preprints","research","csna","mathoc","mathna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":278,"author":"Alejandro Gonz\\'alez Nevado","raw_content_length":1797,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.39,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1796,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Method","Asymptotically Accurate Bounds","Extremal Roots","Eulerian Polynomials","Polynomial Stability Preservers","replace-cross Abstract","the tools","bound extreme roots","multivariate real zero polynomials","the use"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Method":2.0,"Asymptotically Accurate Bounds":2.0,"Extremal Roots":2.0,"Eulerian Polynomials":2.0,"Polynomial Stability Preservers":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the tools":1.0,"bound extreme roots":1.0,"multivariate real zero polynomials":1.0,"the use":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7730219569444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.221,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8442,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9168,"joy":0.0268,"surprise":0.0305,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0058,"anger":0.0118,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on theoretical mathematical methods for bounding roots of polynomials, which could potentially be applied to optimize algorithms in various fields, including climate modeling or energy system optimization.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_693e61583ce0","title":"QAMA: Scalable Quantum Annealing Multi","content":"arXiv:2504.11083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin modern deep learning, while the quadratic time and space complexity limit scalability for long sequences. To address this, Quantum Annealing Multi-Head Attention (QAMA) is proposed, a novel drop-in operator that reformulates attention as an energy-based Hamiltonian optimization problem. In this framework, token interactions are encoded into binary quadratic terms, and quantum annealing is employed to search for low-energy configurations that correspond to effective attention patterns. Unlike classical sparse or approximate attention methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics, QAMA allows sparsity structures to emerge naturally from the optimization process. Theoretically, computational complexity is analysed through single-spin flip dynamics, providing time to solution runtime bounds that depend on the spectral properties of the annealing Hamiltonian. Empirically, evaluation on both natural language and vision benchmarks shows that, across tasks, accuracy deviates by at most 2.7 points from standard multi-head attention, while requiring only linear qubits in sequence length. Visualizations further reveal that the Hamiltonian penalty terms induce meaningful and interpretable sparsity across heads. Finally, deployment on a coherent Ising machine validates the feasibility of running QAMA on real quantum hardware, showing tangible inference-time reductions compared with classical implementations.

In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating two classical channels and two classical-quantum channels. Furthermore, by obtaining an optimal characterization of the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing, including prior probabilities, we provide a more precise characterization of query complexity when the error probability does not exceed a fixed threshold. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\\'enyi and Petz R\\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12989","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.355879","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","cslg","mathst","preprints","research","mathit","statth","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Theshani Nuradha, Mark M.

A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Cornelissen, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang, QTML 2025]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We demonstrate that the worst case guarantees of these algorithms can significantly improve upon the bounds for algorithms in prior work. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20982","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.356272","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","cslg","csds","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Tyler Chen, Archan Ray, Akshay Seshadri, Dylan Herman, Bao Bach, Pranav Deshpande, Abhishek Som, Niraj Kumar, Marco Pistoia","raw_content_length":1253,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Prakash","Lloyd's algorithm)","Doriguello"],"persons":["Kerenidis","k$-means algorithm","Tang","arXiv:2504.20982v3 Announce Type","Cornelissen"],"locations":["Luongo","Landman"],"monetary":["q$-means","k$-means"]},"char_count":1252,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms","the k-means algorithm","time","arXiv250420982v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","The k-means algorithm","Lloyds algorithm","a widely used method","unlabeled data","A key bottleneck"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms","the k-means algorithm","The k-means algorithm","Lloyds algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms":2.0,"the k-means algorithm":2.0,"time":2.0,"arXiv250420982v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The k-means algorithm":1.0,"Lloyds algorithm":1.0,"a widely used method":1.0,"unlabeled data":1.0,"A key bottleneck":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773096375,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8898,"joy":0.0119,"surprise":0.0643,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0142,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new algorithm that improves the efficiency of the k-means clustering algorithm.

CNNs, however, are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. To over-come these issues, recent studies have explored alternative architectures. The Mamba model, a selective state-space design, achieves near-linear complexity and effectively captures long-range dependencies. Its vision-oriented variant, the Visual State Space (VSS) model, extends these strengths to image feature learning. In parallel, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhanc-es nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Moti-vated by these advances, we propose the VSS-Enhanced KAN (VKAN) module, which integrates VSS with the Expanded Field Convolutional KAN (EFC-KAN) as a replacement for Transformer modules, thereby strengthening feature extraction. We further embed VKAN into a U-Net frame-work, resulting in MedVKAN, an efficient medical image segmentation model. Extensive exper-iments on five public datasets demonstrate that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one.

Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

Unlike previous strategies that evaluate antibodies in isolation, typically by comparing them to natural sequences with metrics such as amino acid recovery rate or structural RMSD, AbBiBench instead treats the antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as the fundamental unit. It evaluates an antibody design's binding potential by measuring how well a protein model scores the full Ab-Ag complex. We first curate, standardize, and share more than 184,500 experimental measurements of antibody mutants across 14 antibodies and 9 antigens-including influenza, lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, Ang2, and SARS-CoV-2-covering both heavy-chain and light-chain mutations. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 15 protein models including masked language models, autoregressive language models, inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph models by comparing the correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values. Additionally, to demonstrate AbBiBench's generative utility, we apply it to antibody F045-092 in order to introduce binding to influenza H1N1.

The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate \"hybrid\" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01124","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.360393","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","preprints","research","physicsdata-an","computer-science","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Marco Mancastroppa, Giulia Cencetti, Alain Barrat","raw_content_length":1896,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.295,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EATH","the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1895,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph","a model","realistic time","arXiv250701124v2","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Time-varying group interactions","the building blocks","many complex systems","The framework"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph":2.0,"a model":2.0,"realistic time":2.0,"arXiv250701124v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Time-varying group interactions":1.0,"the building blocks":1.0,"many complex systems":1.0,"The framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7732381644444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8925,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4215,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.73,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0206,"sadness":0.0314,"fear":0.1188,"anger":0.0436,"disgust":0.0501},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a new model for generating synthetic datasets of time-varying group interactions.

While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01613","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.360832","language":"en","tags":["statml","cslg","preprints","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Shirong Xu, Jingnan Zhang, Junhui Wang","raw_content_length":1474,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1473,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ranking Recovery","arXiv250701613v2","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Paired comparison data","users","items","pairs","a central role","ranking and preference learning tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Paired comparison data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ranking Recovery":2.0,"arXiv250701613v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Paired comparison data":1.0,"users":1.0,"items":1.0,"pairs":1.0,"a central role":1.0,"ranking and preference learning tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773252453611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.2955,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8591,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7383,"joy":0.0209,"surprise":0.0143,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.1077,"anger":0.059,"disgust":0.0521},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework suggesting that binarizing ordinal data in paired comparisons can improve ranking accuracy.

The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by Orszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of numerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that turbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very sensitive to small disturbance. Thus, due to the famous butterfly-effect of chaos, unavoidable numerical noises of DNS might have great influence on spatiotemporal trajectories of turbulence. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov turbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than DNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS can greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required small level so that numerical noise can be rigorously negligible throughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In physics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence. Thus, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with that given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal trajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are indeed badly polluted by numerical noise rather quickly, and besides the DNS result has significant deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the spatial symmetry of flow field and the energy cascade but also even in statistics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11805","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.361250","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","nlincd","preprints","mathmp","research","csna","mathna","math-ph","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Shijie Qin, Shijun Liao","raw_content_length":1630,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DNS","CNS"],"persons":["Orszag"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1629,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["turbulence","Clean numerical simulation","CNS","replace-cross Abstract","Turbulence","immense importance","various scientific and engineering disciplines","The direct numerical simulation","DNS","Orszag"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"turbulence":3.0,"Clean numerical simulation":2.0,"CNS":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Turbulence":1.0,"immense importance":1.0,"various scientific and engineering disciplines":1.0,"The direct numerical simulation":1.0,"DNS":1.0,"Orszag":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773267735277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7644,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0188,"sadness":0.0098,"fear":0.1274,"anger":0.0419,"disgust":0.0289},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new numerical simulation method (CNS) that is more accurate than existing DNS methods for simulating 3D turbulent Kolmogorov flow.

Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion. Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was confirmed using Mutual Information (MI).

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_a5d6371826ee","title":"NSPDI","content":"arXiv:2508.21566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation.

However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22551","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.366332","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Xiaocheng Zou, Shijin Duan, Charles Fleming, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Rao Kompella, Shaolei Ren, Xiaolin Xu","raw_content_length":1563,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1562,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ConQuER","Modular Architectures","Control","Bias Mitigation","IQP Quantum Generative Models","arXiv250922551v2","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Quantum generative models","instantaneous quantum polynomial IQP circuits"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Control"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ConQuER":3.0,"Modular Architectures":2.0,"Control":2.0,"Bias Mitigation":2.0,"IQP Quantum Generative Models":2.0,"arXiv250922551v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Quantum generative models":1.0,"instantaneous quantum polynomial IQP circuits":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7734543880555558,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.1105,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5164,"joy":0.0307,"surprise":0.0338,"sadness":0.2135,"fear":0.1085,"anger":0.0572,"disgust":0.0398},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel quantum generative model framework (ConQuER) with improved controllability and reduced bias.

A stereoscopic profilometry technique is used to measure the water surface displacement resolved in both time and space over a significant fraction of the wave tank. The wave regimes are characterized by analyzing the space-time spectral statistical properties of the wave field. At a given, finite, water depth, the effect of dispersion can be varied by tuning the peak frequency of the wave generation. In shallow water conditions, the waves are only weakly dispersive and this enables the propagation of solitons. {In these conditions random wave forcing produces soliton gases}. In deep water conditions, the waves are dispersive and for wideband spectra, one observes the development of weak turbulence. A transition between these regimes is observed when changing the peak forcing frequency (dispersion) and the wave amplitude (nonlinearity), with a clear threshold between states with solitons and soliton-less states. The development of a soliton gas is associated with a strong change of the wave spectrum as well as a significant evolution of the distribution of the water elevation. We also observed a strong effect of the finite size of the tank due to the peculiar reflection laws of line solitons.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09637","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.598854","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","nlinps","physicsao-ph","preprints","research","nlinsi","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Thibault Leduque, Maxime Kaczmarek, Herv\\'e Michallet, Eric Barth\\'elemy, Nicolas Mordant","raw_content_length":1381,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["wideband"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1380,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["water 2D wave turbulence","soliton gas","arXiv251009637v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Experiments","2D random water wave propagation","a large wave tank","dispersion changes","A stereoscopic profilometry technique","the water surface displacement"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"water 2D wave turbulence":2.0,"soliton gas":2.0,"arXiv251009637v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Experiments":1.0,"2D random water wave propagation":1.0,"a large wave tank":1.0,"dispersion changes":1.0,"A stereoscopic profilometry technique":1.0,"the water surface displacement":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773609558888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6986,"joy":0.0181,"surprise":0.0693,"sadness":0.0115,"fear":0.1394,"anger":0.0374,"disgust":0.0257},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on water wave dynamics, specifically the transition between deep and shallow water wave turbulence.

This system integrates seepage, hydration-induced softening, thermal diffusion, and elasto-plastic response to capture the nonlinear dynamics of wellbore stability evolution. A two-dimensional numerical model in a polar coordinate system was established using COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate multi-lithology and multi-parameter perturbations. This process generated a high-dimensional dataset characterizing the evolution of Von Mises stress, plastic strain, pore pressure, temperature, and water content, and its physical consistency was examined. Subsequently, the Seepage-Thermal-Water-Mechanical Physics-Informed Neural Network (STWM-PINN) is proposed. This model embeds governing equation residuals and initial-boundary constraints to achieve high-precision, physically consistent predictions of the wellbore's spatio-temporal evolution under the supervision of finite observational data, laying a foundation for parameter control. Building on this, a Double-Noise Soft Actor-Critic (DN-SAC) algorithm is integrated. A reward function was designed to minimize the probability of instability while considering control smoothness and physical boundary constraints, enabling continuous-space optimization of drilling fluid parameters. A case study demonstrates that the proposed method delays the onset of instability by an average of 32.33% and a maximum of 53.35%, significantly reducing instability risk.

Four findings emerge.(1) The coupled-coordination significantly enhances the synergy, and energy efficiency plays a partial intermediary role in the relationship between the two.(2) The effect is heterogeneous: pronounced in the eastern and western regions, negligible in the central region, and stronger in non-resource-based and non-Yangtze River Basin cities.(3) A double-threshold model reveals a non-linear strengthening pattern as green-finance depth increases.(4) Spatial Durbin estimates show positive spillovers: the coupling of green finance and green technology innovation not only improves the level of local coordination, but also drives the improvement of environmental performance in adjacent areas. These results provide quantitative guidance for allocating green-finance resources, elevating green-innovation efficiency, and designing regionally coordinated mitigation policies.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09707","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.608190","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicssoc-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Guoqiang Liu, Ruijun Xie","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["green finance","green technology innovation","synergistic effect","the coupling","pollution and emission carbon reduction","evidence","China","arXiv251009707v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Chinas dual-carbon transition"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["green technology innovation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"green finance":4.0,"green technology innovation":3.0,"synergistic effect":3.0,"the coupling":2.0,"pollution and emission carbon reduction":2.0,"evidence":2.0,"China":2.0,"arXiv251009707v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Chinas dual-carbon transition":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773753045,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7724,"joy":0.086,"surprise":0.0742,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0205,"anger":0.0296,"disgust":0.0095},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research analyzes the impact of coupling green finance and green technology innovation on pollution and carbon reduction in 266 Chinese cities from 2007-2023.

All these variants alter the airflow through the nasal cavity and can impact how we smell odors. To acquire a better understanding of physiological and pathological functioning, it is important to study the effects of these modifications. SSM, or Statistical Shape Modelling, is a widely used methodology for considering morphological differences within a population. In the literature, only a few studies analyze nasal anatomy in its entirety, including paranasal sinuses, whose segmentation is particularly challenging due to their complexity and variability. This work aims at creating a highly accurate SSM for the nasosinusal complex. A traditional, greyscale thresholding-based segmentation approach was chosen, relying on Mimics software (Leuven, Belgium). 40 computed tomography (CT) datasets were considered. After segmentation, post-processing was performed to obtain watertight meshes using 3-Matic software (Leuven, Belgium), which was also used for the SSM generation. The generated model shows all relevant landmarks that typically characterize a nasosinual complex. 32 different modes are needed to explain 95% of the total variance. As a preliminary output, this study showed the feasibility and consistency of a statistical model of the nasosinusal anatomy. However, additional studies involving a larger sample size and a more robust validation process could be conducted.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09713","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.609013","language":"en","tags":["physicsclass-ph","preprints","physicsmed-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Michele Bertolini (POLIMI), Silvia Tonghini (POLIMI), Marco Rossoni (POLIMI), Marina Carulli (POLIMI), Susanne Weise (TU Dresden), Christian Jan Baldus (POLIMI), Giorgio Colombo (POLIMI), Monica Bordegoni (POLIMI)","raw_content_length":1508,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mimics","the Nasosinusal Anatomy arXiv:2510.09713v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":["Statistical Shape Modelling"],"locations":["Leuven","Belgium"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1507,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Statistical Shape Modelling","the Nasosinusal Anatomy","arXiv251009713v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The human nose","a huge variation","shape","individuals","All these variants","the airflow"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the airflow"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Statistical Shape Modelling":3.0,"the Nasosinusal Anatomy":2.0,"arXiv251009713v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The human nose":1.0,"a huge variation":1.0,"shape":1.0,"individuals":1.0,"All these variants":1.0,"the airflow":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7737830391666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4735,"joy":0.0039,"surprise":0.025,"sadness":0.0236,"fear":0.026,"anger":0.019,"disgust":0.4289},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on creating a statistical shape model (SSM) of the nasosinusal complex using CT datasets.

At CEA-Saclay, a HiCANS has been developed utilizing the IPHI accelerator, which delivers a 3 MeV proton beam with a current of up to 100 mA, and the CEA-Saclay liquid lithium target named SATELIT. In 2024-2025, a successful experimental campaign was conducted, during which a 10 kW proton beam was directed at the liquid lithium target for nearly 100 h to generate neutrons via the 7Li(p,n)7Be nuclear reaction. Throughout the experimental campaign, a total deposited beam power of 840~kW.h was accumulated, including two continuous operational days exceeding 11 h each. A polyethylene moderator coupled with SATELIT enabled the extraction of a thermal neutron beam, with a flux measured at 1.4 m from the extraction point exceeding $10^6$ n.cm$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$, which is sufficient for numerous neutron applications. The next step for the long-term operation of this facility involves developing strategies to mitigate the radiological concerns associated with the accumulation of 7Be within the system. Overall, this work demonstrates that such facilities can play a significant role in the future of medium-scale neutron sources in Europe.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09727","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.615043","language":"en","tags":["nucl-ex","physicsacc-ph","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"L.

The last 20 years have seen a plethora of contributions relating complex networks with climate data and climate models. We provide a view of climate networks through a triad of frameworks and associated paradigms: (a) networks of data, where both (geographical) nodes and their links (arcs) are determined according to some metrics and/or statistical criteria; (b) climate data over networks, where the structure of the network (for both vertices and edges) is topologically pre-determined, and the climate variable is continuously defined over the (nonlinear) network; finally, (c) networks for data, referring to the huge machinery based on networks within the realm machine learning and statistics, with specific emphasis on their use for climate data. This paper is not a mere description of each element of the network triad, but rather a manifesto for the creation of three classes of fusions (we term them bridges). We advocate and carefully justify a fusion within to provide a corpus unicuum inside the network triad. We then prove that the fusion within is the starting point for a fusion between, where the network triad becomes a condition sine qua non for the implementation of the Shaw-Stevens agenda. We culminate with a meta fusion that allows for the creation of what we term a Shaw-Stevens network ecosystem.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09728","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.615505","language":"en","tags":["physicssoc-ph","preprints","statme","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Emilio Porcu, Tobia Filosi, Horst Simon","raw_content_length":1599,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Triad of Networks","Triad of Fusions"],"persons":["Stevens","Shaw"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1598,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Triad","Networks","a Triad","Fusions","the Other Climate Crisis","arXiv251009728v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Shaw","Stevens","a new paradigm"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Triad":2.0,"Networks":2.0,"a Triad":2.0,"Fusions":2.0,"the Other Climate Crisis":2.0,"arXiv251009728v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Shaw":1.0,"Stevens":1.0,"a new paradigm":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773831856666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8155,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6369,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7024,"joy":0.0133,"surprise":0.0656,"sadness":0.0165,"fear":0.0257,"anger":0.1337,"disgust":0.0429},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new framework for analyzing climate data using network analysis and machine learning.

Moreover, all the detected communities for all the cohorts can be organized into a hierarchical tree. This allows us to observe a number of clusters of communities, originating from diverse age and sex cohorts, that group together communities characterized by the same disease classes.
