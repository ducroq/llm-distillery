However, the limited availability of 7T scanners restricts widespread clinical adoption due to substantial infrastructure costs and technical demands. Computational approaches for synthesizing 7T-quality images from accessible 3T acquisitions present a viable solution to this accessibility challenge. Existing CNN approaches suffer from limited spatial coverage, while Transformer models demand excessive computational overhead. RWKV architectures offer an efficient alternative for global feature modeling in medical image synthesis, combining linear computational complexity with strong long-range dependency capture. Building on this foundation, we propose Frequency Spatial-RWKV (FS-RWKV), an RWKV-based framework for 3T-to-7T MRI translation. To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation and global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1) Frequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete wavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the low-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while preserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity Enhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical structure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on UNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing CNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w modalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08951","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.796553","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Yingtie Lei, Zimeng Li, Chi-Man Pun, Yupeng Liu, Xuhang Chen","raw_content_length":1787,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Transformer","Frequency Spatial-RWKV","CNN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1786,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["FS-RWKV","Leveraging Frequency Spatial-Aware RWKV","Announce Type","cross","Ultra-high-field 7T MRI","enhanced spatial resolution","tissue","contrast","the detection","subtle pathological changes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"FS-RWKV":2.0,"Leveraging Frequency Spatial-Aware RWKV":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Ultra-high-field 7T MRI":1.0,"enhanced spatial resolution":1.0,"tissue":1.0,"contrast":1.0,"the detection":1.0,"subtle pathological changes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7690634505555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8898,"joy":0.0136,"surprise":0.0356,"sadness":0.0159,"fear":0.0276,"anger":0.0108,"disgust":0.0066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI framework (FS-RWKV) for synthesizing high-quality MRI images from lower-quality ones, potentially reducing the need for expensive 7T scanners.

While the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2 to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in segmentation overlap and boundary precision.

Bayesian Quadrature (BQ) has emerged as a competitive framework for tackling this challenge, as it provides flexible balance between computational cost and accuracy. The performance of a BQ scheme is fundamentally dictated by the acquisition function as it exclusively governs the generation of integration points. After reexamining one of the most advanced acquisition function from a prospective inference perspective and reformulating the quadrature rules for prediction, four new acquisition functions, inspired by distinct intuitions on expected rewards, are primarily developed, all of which are accompanied by elegant interpretations and highly efficient numerical estimators. Mathematically, these four acquisition functions measure, respectively, the prediction uncertainty of posterior, the contribution to prediction uncertainty of evidence, as well as the expected reduction of prediction uncertainties concerning posterior and evidence, and thus provide flexibility for highly effective design of integration points. These acquisition functions are further extended to the transitional BQ scheme, along with several specific refinements, to tackle the above-mentioned challenges with high efficiency and robustness. Effectiveness of the developments is ultimately demonstrated with extensive benchmark studies and application to an engineering example.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08974","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.797378","language":"en","tags":["research","mathna","preprints","csna","computer-science","statco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Jingwen Song, Pengfei Wei","raw_content_length":1680,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bayesian Model Inference"],"persons":[],"locations":["Bayesian"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1679,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bayesian Quadrature","Bayesian Model Inference","the Art","Acquisition Functions","arXiv251008974v1 Announce Type","cross","Estimating posteriors","the associated model evidences","a core issue","Bayesian model inference"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["Acquisition Functions"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bayesian Quadrature":3.0,"Bayesian Model Inference":2.0,"the Art":2.0,"Acquisition Functions":2.0,"arXiv251008974v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Estimating posteriors":1.0,"the associated model evidences":1.0,"a core issue":1.0,"Bayesian model inference":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7690936525,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.815999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7632,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7963,"joy":0.0295,"surprise":0.072,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0429,"anger":0.0455,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents new acquisition functions for Bayesian Quadrature, a method for estimating posteriors in Bayesian model inference.

We study this problem in the local broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case. We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles, hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09143","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.797769","language":"en","tags":["csdc","research","cscc","preprints","mathco","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Louis Esperet, Jean-Florent Raymond","raw_content_length":1171,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Khan","Vaidya","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1168,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the local broadcast model","Multiparty equality","the vertices","arXiv251009143v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","this paper","the multiparty equality problem","graphs","every vertex"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the local broadcast model":3.0,"Multiparty equality":2.0,"the vertices":2.0,"arXiv251009143v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"the multiparty equality problem":1.0,"graphs":1.0,"every vertex":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7691101199999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.4865,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8309,"joy":0.0429,"surprise":0.0854,"sadness":0.0093,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0187,"disgust":0.0076},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of communication protocols in distributed networks.

One of the first such results showed a lower bound on the absolute value of the smallest root $\\beta(G)$ of the polynomial. Furthermore, when $G$ is connected, Goldwurm and Santini established that $\\beta(G)$ is a simple real root of $I(G,z)$ smaller than one. An alternative proof was given by Csikv\\'ari.

We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data.

In practice, it is often challenging to achieve the preferred bandwidth for an automotive microphone when considering limitations and constraints on microphone placement inside the cabin, and the automotive grade environmental robustness requirements. On the other hand, there seems to be no consensus or sufficient data on the effect of each microphone characteristic on the actual performance. As an attempt to answer this question, we used noise signals recorded in real vehicles and under various driving conditions to experimentally study the relationship between the microphones' characteristics and the final audio quality of speech communication and performance of ASR engines. We focus on how variations in microphone bandwidth and amplitude frequency response shapes affect the perceptual speech quality.

We develop an agent based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, trained to simulate hedging decisions without making explicit model assumptions on price dynamics. The agent was trained on historical intraday prices of S\\&P~500 call options across years 2004--2024, using a single time series of six predictor variables: option price, underlying asset price, moneyness, time to maturity, realized volatility, and current hedge position. A walk-forward procedure was applied for training, which led to nearly 17~years of out-of-sample evaluation. The performance of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent is benchmarked against the Black--Scholes delta-hedging strategy over the same period. We assess both approaches using metrics such as annualized return, volatility, information ratio, and Sharpe ratio. To test the models' adaptability, we performed simulations across varying market conditions and added constraints such as transaction costs and risk-awareness penalties. Our results show that the DRL agent can outperform traditional hedging methods, particularly in volatile or high-cost environments, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in practical trading contexts. While the agent consistently outperforms delta-hedging, its performance deteriorates when the risk-awareness parameter is higher. We also observed that the longer the time interval used for volatility estimation, the more stable the results.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09247","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.800215","language":"en","tags":["q-finpr","research","preprints","q-fincp","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Zofia Bracha, Pawe{\\l} Sakowski, Jakub Micha\\'nk\\'ow","raw_content_length":1632,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["S\\&P~500","DRL","Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1623,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Application","Deep Reinforcement Learning","arXiv251009247v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This paper","the application","deep Q-learning","the-money","the SP500 index"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Application":2.0,"Deep Reinforcement Learning":2.0,"arXiv251009247v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the application":1.0,"deep Q-learning":1.0,"the-money":1.0,"the SP500 index":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7692005161111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8762,"joy":0.0444,"surprise":0.0524,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0097,"disgust":0.0033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores using deep reinforcement learning for hedging options, potentially improving risk management in financial markets.

We show that a compact glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$, the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force, which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the inertial lift force at large Re$_p$. *These authors contributed equally.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09250","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.800635","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","physicsflu-dyn","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"X.

Yet, it remains a fundamental challenge due to continuously evolving anatomy of the subjects, motion artifacts, and the scarcity of high-quality labeled data. In this work, we present LODi, a novel framework that utilizes prior knowledge from an adult brain MRI segmentation model to enhance the segmentation performance of infant scans. Given the abundance of publicly available adult brain MRI data, we pre-train a segmentation model on a large adult dataset as a starting point. Through transfer learning and domain adaptation strategies, we progressively adapt the model to the 0-2 year-old population, enabling it to account for the anatomical and imaging variability typical of infant scans. The adaptation of the adult model is carried out using weakly supervised learning on infant brain scans, leveraging silver-standard ground truth labels obtained with FreeSurfer. By introducing a novel training strategy that integrates hierarchical feature refinement and multi-level consistency constraints, our method enables fast, accurate, age-adaptive segmentation, while mitigating scanner and site-specific biases. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional supervised learning and domain-specific models. Our findings highlight the advantage of leveraging adult brain priors as a foundation for age-flexible neuroimaging analysis, paving the way for more reliable and generalizable brain MRI segmentation across the lifespan.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09306","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.801451","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Alemu Sisay Nigru, Michele Svanera, Austin Dibble, Connor Dalby, Mattia Savardi, Sergio Benini","raw_content_length":1689,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Rewiring Development"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1688,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Rewiring Development","Brain Segmentation","Adult Brain Priors","Enhancing Infant MRI Segmentation","arXiv251009306v1 Announce Type","cross","Accurate segmentation","infant brain MRI","early neurodevelopment","neurological disorders"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Rewiring Development","early neurodevelopment"],"ai_ml":["Brain Segmentation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Rewiring Development":2.0,"Brain Segmentation":2.0,"Adult Brain Priors":2.0,"Enhancing Infant MRI Segmentation":2.0,"arXiv251009306v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Accurate segmentation":1.0,"infant brain MRI":1.0,"early neurodevelopment":1.0,"neurological disorders":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7692470505555558,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9011,"joy":0.0268,"surprise":0.0401,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0109,"anger":0.0113,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel framework (LODi) for infant brain MRI segmentation using transfer learning from adult brain MRI data.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_bdedcf8101e3","title":"Reliability Sensitivity with Response Gradient","content":"arXiv:2510.09315v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Engineering risk is concerned with the likelihood of failure and the scenarios when it occurs. The sensitivity of failure probability to change in system parameters is relevant to risk-informed decision making. Computing sensitivity is at least one level more difficult than the probability itself, which is already challenged by a large number of input random variables, rare events and implicit nonlinear `black-box' response. Finite difference with Monte Carlo probability estimates is spurious, requiring the number of samples to grow with the reciprocal of step size to suppress estimation variance. Many existing works gain efficiency by exploiting a specific class of input variables, sensitivity parameters, or response in its exact or surrogate form. For general systems, this work presents a theory and associated Monte Carlo strategy for computing sensitivity using response values and gradients with respect to sensitivity parameters. It is shown that the sensitivity at a given response threshold can be expressed via the expectation of response gradient conditional on the threshold. Determining the expectation requires conditioning on the threshold that is a zero-probability event, but it can be resolved by the concept of kernel smoothing. The proposed method offers sensitivity estimates for all response thresholds generated in a single Monte Carlo run. It is investigated in a number of examples featuring sensitivity parameters of different nature. As response gradient becomes increasingly available, it is hoped that this work can provide the basis for embedding sensitivity calculations with reliability in the same Monte Carlo run.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09315","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.802321","language":"en","tags":["statml","statme","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Siu-Kui Au, Zi-Jun Cao","raw_content_length":1708,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Reliability Sensitivity"],"persons":["Computing","Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1707,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reliability Sensitivity","Response Gradient","arXiv251009315v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Engineering risk","the likelihood","failure","the scenarios","The sensitivity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["failure"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reliability Sensitivity":2.0,"Response Gradient":2.0,"arXiv251009315v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Engineering risk":1.0,"the likelihood":1.0,"failure":1.0,"the scenarios":1.0,"The sensitivity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7692769866666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.5459999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8908,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.415,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.0195,"sadness":0.0181,"fear":0.5155,"anger":0.0181,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for computing sensitivity in engineering risk assessment, which could potentially improve the reliability of systems designed for climate mitigation or adaptation.

In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\\log \\rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09362","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.805068","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","astro-phim","preprints","astro-phsr","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Sankalp Gilda","raw_content_length":1309,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["deep-REMAP","FGK","PHOENIX"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["T_{\\rm{eff}}$.","T_{\\rm{eff}}$"]},"char_count":1308,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","Abstract","the era","survey volumes","traditional methods","spectroscopic analysis","their limits","response","deep-REMAP","a novel deep learning framework"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a novel deep learning framework"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the era":1.0,"survey volumes":1.0,"traditional methods":1.0,"spectroscopic analysis":1.0,"their limits":1.0,"response":1.0,"deep-REMAP":1.0,"a novel deep learning framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769321098611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8829,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0444,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0271,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel deep learning framework for stellar characterization.

We develop quantum network control algorithms under the mathematical framework of Quantum Network Utility Maximization (QNUM), where utility functions quantify network performance by mapping entanglement rate and quality into a joint optimization objective. We then introduce QPrimal-Dual, a decentralized, scalable algorithm that solves QNUM by strategically placing network controllers that operate using local state information and limited classical message exchange. We prove global asymptotic stability for concave, separable utility functions, and provide sufficient conditions for local stability for broader non-concave cases. To reduce control overhead and account for quantum memory decoherence, we also propose schemes that locally approximate global quantities and prevent congestion in the network. We evaluate the performance of our approach via simulations in realistic quantum network architectures. Results show that QPrimalDual significantly outperforms baseline allocation strategies, scales with network size, and is robust to latency and decoherence. Our observations suggest that QPrimalDual could be a practical, high-performance foundation for fully distributed resource allocation in quantum networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09371","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.805919","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","quant-ph","cspf","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Nitish K.

However, they tend to face significant challenges in accessing credit due to limited financial histories, collateral constraints, and exposure to macroeconomic shocks. These challenges make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09407","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.806346","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","q-fingn","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Sahab Zandi, Kamesh Korangi, Juan C.

While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09415","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.806773","language":"en","tags":["csne","research","q-bionc","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Beige Jerry Jin, Leila Wehbe","raw_content_length":1745,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MEG"],"persons":["LeBel et al."],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1744,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Brain Activity","High Spatial","Temporal Resolution","a Naturalistic MEG","arXiv251009415v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","spatial resolution","temporal resolution","magnetoencephalography"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Brain Activity"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Brain Activity":2.0,"High Spatial":2.0,"Temporal Resolution":2.0,"a Naturalistic MEG":2.0,"arXiv251009415v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"spatial resolution":1.0,"temporal resolution":1.0,"magnetoencephalography":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7693810019444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.062000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6124,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8308,"joy":0.0178,"surprise":0.0559,"sadness":0.0177,"fear":0.0338,"anger":0.0274,"disgust":0.0167},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving brain activity estimation using MEG and fMRI data.

Currently, hierarchically deep neural networks (DNNs) have played a significant role as tools for mining the core features of complex data. However, most methods often overlook the dynamic generation process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data, within the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main paradigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests', which we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall structure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly use the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and the hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e., fine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying the adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive Topological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT. In numerous experiments, the results reveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the visual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that \"the hierarchical information content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by decoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy.\" Among them, we found that neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding performance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant scientific value.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09451","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.807186","language":"en","tags":["csne","research","q-bionc","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Jingyi Feng, Xiang Feng","raw_content_length":1679,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hierarchical Neural Information Gradients","the Allen Brain Institute","Mouse Visual Tasks"],"persons":["Adaptive Decoding","Neuropixel"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1678,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hierarchical Neural Information Gradients","Mouse Visual Tasks","arXiv251009451v1 Announce Type","cross","the encoding and decoding mechanisms","dynamic neural responses","different visual stimuli","an important topic","the brain","visual information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the brain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hierarchical Neural Information Gradients":2.0,"Mouse Visual Tasks":2.0,"arXiv251009451v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"the encoding and decoding mechanisms":1.0,"dynamic neural responses":1.0,"different visual stimuli":1.0,"an important topic":1.0,"the brain":1.0,"visual information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769396895,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2405,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8481,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.869,"joy":0.0075,"surprise":0.0445,"sadness":0.0114,"fear":0.015,"anger":0.0303,"disgust":0.0223},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for decoding brain activity related to visual tasks using neural networks.

However, many real-world applications, from signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning, making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09477","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.807618","language":"en","tags":["statml","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Conor Hassan, Nasrulloh Loka, Cen-You Li, Daolang Huang, Paul E.

In this work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems in soft robotics and smart structures.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09511","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.808442","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","physicsapp-ph","csro","computer-science","cond-matsoft","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Michele Curatolo, Renate Sachse, Edoardo Milana","raw_content_length":1301,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1300,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["stiffness","multistability","arXiv251009511v1 Announce Type","cross","Mechanical metamaterials","unconventional and programmable mechanical responses","structural design","material composition","this work","a toggleable stiffness effect"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"stiffness":2.0,"multistability":2.0,"arXiv251009511v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Mechanical metamaterials":1.0,"unconventional and programmable mechanical responses":1.0,"structural design":1.0,"material composition":1.0,"this work":1.0,"a toggleable stiffness effect":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7694397866666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5889,"joy":0.0127,"surprise":0.3023,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0332,"anger":0.0244,"disgust":0.0321},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel mechanical metamaterial with toggleable stiffness, validated by 3D-printed prototypes.

The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the joint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport map from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map, enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach is computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based counterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d8aa51597e13","title":"Fully","content":"arXiv:2009.00800v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In submodular covering problems, we are given a monotone, nonnegative submodular function $f: 2^N \\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_+$ and wish to find the min-cost set $S\\subseteq N$ such that $f(S)=f(N)$. This captures SetCover when $f$ is a coverage function. We introduce a general framework for solving such problems in a fully-dynamic setting where the function $f$ changes over time, and only a bounded number of updates to the solution (recourse) is allowed. For concreteness, suppose a nonnegative monotone submodular function $g_t$ is added or removed from an active set $G^{(t)}$ at each time $t$. If $f^{(t)}=\\sum_{g\\in G^{(t)}} g$ is the sum of all active functions, we wish to maintain a competitive solution to SubmodularCover for $f^{(t)}$ as this active set changes, and with low recourse. We give an algorithm that maintains an $O(\\log(f_{max}/f_{min}))$-competitive solution, where $f_{max}, f_{min}$ are the largest/smallest marginals of $f^{(t)}$. The algorithm guarantees a total recourse of $O(\\log(c_{max}/ c_{min})\\cdot\\sum_{t\\leq T}g_t(N))$, where $c_{max},c_{min}$ are the largest/smallest costs of elements in $N$. This competitive ratio is best possible even in the offline setting, and the recourse bound is optimal up to the logarithmic factor. For monotone submodular functions that also have positive mixed third derivatives, we show an optimal recourse bound of $O(\\sum_{t\\leq T}g_t(N))$. This structured class includes set-coverage functions, so our algorithm matches the known $O(\\log n)$-competitiveness and $O(1)$ recourse guarantees for fully-dynamic SetCover. Our work simultaneously simplifies and unifies previous results, as well as generalizes to a significantly larger class of covering problems. Our key technique is a new potential function inspired by Tsallis entropy. We also extensively use the idea of Mutual Coverage, which generalizes the classic notion of mutual information.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00800","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.812405","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csds","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":277,"author":"Anupam Gupta, Roie Levin","raw_content_length":1972,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.385,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SetCover","SubmodularCover"],"persons":["f(S)=f(N)$.","g_t$"],"locations":[],"monetary":["f^{(t)}=\\sum_{g\\in","$O(\\log(f_{max}/f_{min}))$-competitive solution"]},"char_count":1969,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv200900800v2 Announce Type","Abstract","submodular covering problems","a monotone","nonnegative submodular function","fSfN","SetCover","a coverage function","a general framework","such problems"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv200900800v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"submodular covering problems":1.0,"a monotone":1.0,"nonnegative submodular function":1.0,"fSfN":1.0,"SetCover":1.0,"a coverage function":1.0,"a general framework":1.0,"such problems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769517226944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9232,"joy":0.0207,"surprise":0.0329,"sadness":0.0097,"fear":0.0034,"anger":0.0063,"disgust":0.0038},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for solving submodular covering problems in a dynamic setting, which could be applied to resource allocation for environmental protection or disaster response.

This effect is even more pronounced when the coarse propagator uses a reduced spatial resolution. However, some combinations of spatial discretization and numerical time stepping nevertheless allow for Parareal to converge with monotonically decreasing errors. This raises the question how these configurations can be distinguished theoretically from those where the error initially increases, sometimes over many orders of magnitude. For linear problems, we prove a theorem that implies that the 2-norm of the Parareal iteration matrix is not a suitable tool to predict convergence for hyperbolic problems when spatial coarsening is used. We then show numerical results that suggest that the pseudo-spectral radius can reliably indicate if a given configuration of Parareal will show transient growth or monotonic convergence. For the studied examples, it also provides a good quantitative estimate of the convergence rate in the first few Parareal iterations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10228","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.812862","language":"en","tags":["research","mathna","csce","preprints","csna","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Judith Angel, Sebastian G\\\"otschel, Daniel Ruprecht","raw_content_length":1144,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Parareal"],"persons":["Parareal","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1143,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Impact","spatial coarsening","Parareal convergence","the linear advection equation","Announce Type","Abstract","time","hyperbolic partial differential equations","This effect","the coarse propagator"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Impact":2.0,"spatial coarsening":2.0,"Parareal convergence":2.0,"the linear advection equation":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"time":1.0,"hyperbolic partial differential equations":1.0,"This effect":1.0,"the coarse propagator":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769531658333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6031,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0417,"sadness":0.0283,"fear":0.0872,"anger":0.0681,"disgust":0.1651},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on improving the convergence of a parallel-in-time integration method for hyperbolic partial differential equations.

We consider a setting in which past demands observed under ``close by'' contexts come from close by distributions and analyze the performance of data-driven algorithms through a notion of context-dependent worst-case expected regret. We analyze the broad class of Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization (WERM) policies which weigh past data according to their similarity in the contextual space. This class includes classical policies such as ERM, k-Nearest Neighbors and kernel-based policies. Our main methodological contribution is to characterize exactly the worst-case regret of any WERM policy on any given configuration of contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first understanding of tight performance guarantees in any contextual decision-making problem, with past literature focusing on upper bounds via concentration inequalities. We instead take an optimization approach, and isolate a structure in the Newsvendor loss function that allows to reduce the infinite-dimensional optimization problem over worst-case distributions to a simple line search. This in turn allows us to unveil fundamental insights that were obfuscated by previous general-purpose bounds. We characterize actual guaranteed performance as a function of the contexts, as well as granular insights on the learning curve of algorithms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08424","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.814916","language":"en","tags":["statme","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Omar Besbes, Will Ma, Omar Mouchtaki","raw_content_length":1625,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ERM","k-Nearest Neighbors","WERM","Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization"],"persons":["Newsvendor"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1624,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Contextual Data","Newsvendor Decisions","the Actual Performance","Data","which","arXiv230208424v5 Announce Type","Abstract","this work","how the relevancequality","quantity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Contextual Data":2.0,"Newsvendor Decisions":2.0,"the Actual Performance":2.0,"Data":2.0,"which":2.0,"arXiv230208424v5 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this work":1.0,"how the relevancequality":1.0,"quantity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769592669166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.7015000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6597,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8453,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0485,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0549,"anger":0.0193,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for optimizing decision-making in uncertain demand scenarios, potentially leading to more efficient resource allocation.

However, the inherently sensitive nature of private data demands robust privacy preservation measures during the customization of LLM services to ensure data security, maintain user trust, and comply with stringent regulatory standards. Based on PEFT, we propose Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (RAPT), a framework that offers privacy protection for LLM services. RAPT adopts a local privacy approach, enabling users to privatize their data locally using a text-to-text local differential privacy mechanism. Since PEFT performs poorly when directly trained on privatized data, we introduce a novel privatized token reconstruction task that is trained jointly with the downstream task, allowing LLMs to learn better task-dependent representations. Despite the simplicity of our framework, experiments show that RAPT achieves competitive performance across tasks while providing privacy guarantees against adversaries.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06212","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.815337","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Yansong Li, Zhixing Tan, Paula Branco, Yang Liu","raw_content_length":1154,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning","LLM","RAPT","Privacy-Preserving Parameter"],"persons":["Large Language Models"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1153,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Privacy-Preserving Parameter","arXiv230506212v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning PEFT","a practical way","users","Large Language Models","LLMs","their private data","LLM service scenarios"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Privacy-Preserving Parameter":2.0,"arXiv230506212v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning PEFT":1.0,"a practical way":1.0,"users":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"their private data":1.0,"LLM service scenarios":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7696082786111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.329,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8658,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9384,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0109,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.013,"anger":0.0151,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel framework (RAPT) for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of large language models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e4d17202d9da","title":"Improving Image Captioning Descriptiveness by Ranking and LLM","content":"arXiv:2306.11593v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11593","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.815792","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","csdb","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":266,"author":"Luigi Celona, Simone Bianco, Marco Donzella, Paolo Napoletano","raw_content_length":1883,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.33,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Context","SoTA","MicroSoft","Ranking and LLM arXiv:2306.11593v3 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1882,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Image","Captioning Descriptiveness","Ranking","LLM","arXiv230611593v3 Announce Type","Abstract","-Art SoTA","the MicroSoft Common Objects","Context MS-COCO dataset","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Image":2.0,"Captioning Descriptiveness":2.0,"Ranking":2.0,"LLM":2.0,"arXiv230611593v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"-Art SoTA":1.0,"the MicroSoft Common Objects":1.0,"Context MS-COCO dataset":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7696244094444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8055,"joy":0.0027,"surprise":0.0222,"sadness":0.0636,"fear":0.01,"anger":0.0348,"disgust":0.0611},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to improve image captioning using pre-trained models and LLMs. While it shows improvements in caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction based on ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics, there's no direct link to climate impact or sustainability.

However, existing work on fair GNNs often assumes that either sensitive attributes are fully observed or they are missing completely at random. We show that an adversarial missingness process can inadvertently disguise a fair model through the imputation, leading the model to overestimate the fairness of its predictions. We address this challenge by proposing Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS), a fair missing data imputation model for sensitive attributes. The key principle behind BFtS is that imputations should approximate the worst-case scenario for fairness -- i.e. when optimizing fairness is the hardest. We implement this idea using a 3-player adversarial scheme where two adversaries collaborate against a GNN classifier, and the classifier minimizes the maximum bias. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets show that BFtS often achieves a better fairness x accuracy trade-off than existing alternatives under an adversarial missingness process.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01591","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.818020","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Debolina Halder Lina, Arlei Silva","raw_content_length":1174,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.82,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Graph Neural Networks","Better Fair than Sorry (BFtS","Adversarial Missingness Processes","GNN"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["BFtS"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1173,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fair Graph Machine Learning","Adversarial Missingness Processes","arXiv231101591v4","Announce Type","Abstract","Graph Neural Networks","GNNs","the-art","many relevant tasks","decisions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fair Graph Machine Learning","Graph Neural Networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fair Graph Machine Learning":2.0,"Adversarial Missingness Processes":2.0,"arXiv231101591v4":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Graph Neural Networks":1.0,"GNNs":1.0,"the-art":1.0,"many relevant tasks":1.0,"decisions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769655813888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9178,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.0082,"anger":0.021,"disgust":0.0157},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel algorithm (BFtS) to improve fairness in Graph Neural Networks under adversarial conditions, specifically addressing the issue of missing sensitive attributes.

The introduction of pre-trained models has brought new tuning paradigms to CIL. In this paper, we revisit different parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods within the context of continual learning. We observe that adapter tuning demonstrates superiority over prompt-based methods, even without parameter expansion in each learning session. Motivated by this, we propose incrementally tuning the shared adapter without imposing parameter update constraints, enhancing the learning capacity of the backbone. Additionally, we employ feature sampling from stored prototypes to retrain a unified classifier, further improving its performance. We estimate the semantic shift of old prototypes without access to past samples and update stored prototypes session by session.

For this, we recall a discrete de-Rham framework in which discontinuous approximation spaces for vectors fits. The discrete adjoint divergence and curl are proven to be exactly preserved by the discontinuous Galerkin method under a small assumption on the numerical flux.

Currently, the mainstream of existing MU methods involves modifying the forgetting data with incorrect labels and subsequently fine-tuning the model. While learning such incorrect information can indeed remove knowledge, the process is quite unnatural as the unlearning process undesirably reinforces the incorrect information and leads to over-forgetting. Towards more \\textit{natural} machine unlearning, we inject correct information from the remaining data to the forgetting samples when changing their labels. Through pairing these adjusted samples with their labels, the model will tend to use the injected correct information and naturally suppress the information meant to be forgotten. Albeit straightforward, such a first step towards natural machine unlearning can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our method substantially reduces the over-forgetting and leads to strong robustness to hyperparameters, making it a promising candidate for practical machine unlearning.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15495","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.822023","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Zhengbao He, Tao Li, Xinwen Cheng, Zhehao Huang, Xiaolin Huang","raw_content_length":1230,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Albeit"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1229,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Natural Machine Unlearning","arXiv240515495v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Machine","information","specific training data","data","a pre-trained model","the mainstream","existing MU methods"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine","data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Natural Machine Unlearning":2.0,"arXiv240515495v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Machine":1.0,"information":1.0,"specific training data":1.0,"data":1.0,"a pre-trained model":1.0,"the mainstream":1.0,"existing MU methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.769810642222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1368,"joy":0.001,"surprise":0.0147,"sadness":0.0289,"fear":0.0464,"anger":0.0197,"disgust":0.7525},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to machine unlearning, aiming to improve the efficiency and robustness of the process.

We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20179","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.822499","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","csro","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Zichao Hu, Junyi Jessy Li, Arjun Guha, Joydeep Biswas","raw_content_length":1508,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Robo arXiv:2405.20179v5 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1507,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robo","arXiv240520179v5 Announce Type","Abstract","Code LLMs","promising results","tasks","natural language","programs","service robots","small specialized LLMs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Code LLMs","natural language"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robo":2.0,"arXiv240520179v5 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Code LLMs":1.0,"promising results":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"natural language":1.0,"programs":1.0,"service robots":1.0,"small specialized LLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7698259869444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.3445,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8689,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8536,"joy":0.0152,"surprise":0.0426,"sadness":0.0597,"fear":0.0074,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0083},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the efficiency of code LLMs for robot task programming using a novel simulation environment.

With the development of artificial intelligence, WVR engagement progressively advances towards intelligent and autonomous modes. However, autonomous WVR engagement policy learning is hindered by challenges such as weak exploration capabilities, low learning efficiency, and unrealistic simulated environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitative reinforcement learning framework, which efficiently leverages expert data while enabling autonomous exploration. The proposed framework not only enhances learning efficiency through expert imitation, but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments via autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn a successful policy of `pursuit-lock-launch' for UCAVs. To support data-driven learning, we establish an environment based on the Harfang3D sandbox. The extensive experiment results indicate that the proposed framework excels in this multistage task, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods.

Given an arbitrary linear function of data streams defined in a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_d$, the LC-QMAC problem seeks the optimal communication cost (minimum number of qudits that need to be sent by the transmitters to the receiver, per computation instance) over a noise-free QMAC, when the independent input data streams originate at the corresponding transmitters, who share quantum entanglement in advance.

To this end, we first consider disjunctive timed networks (DTNs), i.e., networks of TAs that communicate via location guards that enable a transition only if there is another process in a certain location. We solve for the first time the case with unrestricted clock invariants, and establish that the parameterized model checking problem (PMCP) over finite local traces can be reduced to the corresponding model checking problem on a single TA. Moreover, we prove that the PMCP for networks that communicate via lossy broadcast can be reduced to the PMCP for DTNs. Finally, we show that for networks with k-wise synchronization, and therefore also for timed Petri nets, location reachability can be reduced to location reachability in DTNs.

A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance.

To address this issue, we introduce a novel probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges: (1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method. Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert scanning dataset with 1.67 million samples demonstrate that our proposed sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared to other advanced baseline methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15026","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.825644","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Haojun Jiang, Teng Wang, Zhenguo Sun, Yulin Wang, Yang Yue, Yu Sun, Ning Jia, Meng Li, Shaqi Luo, Shiji Song, Gao Huang","raw_content_length":1603,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.055,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cardiac","Sequence arXiv:2408.15026v3 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1602,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["UltraSeP","Sequence","arXiv240815026v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Echocardiography","an essential medical technique","cardiovascular diseases","its high operational complexity","a shortage","trained professionals"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["trained professionals"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"UltraSeP":2.0,"Sequence":2.0,"arXiv240815026v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Echocardiography":1.0,"an essential medical technique":1.0,"cardiovascular diseases":1.0,"its high operational complexity":1.0,"a shortage":1.0,"trained professionals":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7699347636111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.577,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1154,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3904,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.014,"sadness":0.0376,"fear":0.4753,"anger":0.0528,"disgust":0.0241},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel algorithm for guiding echocardiography probe movement, potentially reducing the need for highly trained professionals.

We address $n$-fold ILPs where the matrix $\\mathcal{A}$ has a specific structure, i.e., where the blocks in the lower part of $\\mathcal{A}$ consist only of the row vectors $(1,\\dots,1)$. In this paper, we propose an approach tailored to exactly these combinatorial $n$-folds. We utilize a divide and conquer approach to separate the original problem such that the right-hand side iteratively decreases in size. We show that this decrease in size can be calculated such that we only need to consider a bounded amount of possible right-hand sides. This, in turn, lets us efficiently combine solutions of the smaller right-hand sides to solve the original problem. We can decide the feasibility of, and also optimally solve, such problems in time $(n r \\Delta)^{O(r)} \\log(\\|b\\|_\\infty),$ where $n$ is the number of blocks, $r$ the number of rows in the upper blocks and $\\Delta=\\|A\\|_\\infty$. We complement the algorithm by discussing applications of the $n$-fold ILPs with the specific structure we require. We consider the problems of (i) scheduling on uniform machines, (ii) closest string and (iii) (graph) imbalance. Regarding (i), our algorithm results in running times of $p_{\\max}^{O(d)}|I|^{O(1)},$ matching a lower bound derived via ETH. For (ii) we achieve running times matching the current state-of-the-art in the general case.

In terms of performance (cost and accuracy), our methods overperform existing dynamical low-rank techniques. Several applications to stiff differential equations demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and low variance of the new methods, despite their inherent randomness. Allowing augmentation of the range and corange, the new methods have a good potential for preserving critical physical quantities such as the energy, mass and momentum. Numerical experiments on the Vlasov-Poisson equation are particularly encouraging. The new methods comprise two essential steps: a range estimation step followed by a post-processing step.

Subsequently, we propose two methods for post-processing, leading to two time-stepping methods: dynamical randomized singular value decomposition (DRSVD) and dynamical generalized Nystr\\\"om (DGN).

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2caf73ab445b","title":"Gaussian Scenes: Pose-Free Sparse","content":"arXiv:2411.15966v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generative approach for pose-free (without camera parameters) reconstruction of 360 scenes from a sparse set of 2D images. Pose-free scene reconstruction from incomplete, pose-free observations is usually regularized with depth estimation or 3D foundational priors. While recent advances have enabled sparse-view reconstruction of large complex scenes (with high degree of foreground and background detail) with known camera poses using view-conditioned generative priors, these methods cannot be directly adapted for the pose-free setting when ground-truth poses are not available during evaluation. To address this, we propose an image-to-image generative model designed to inpaint missing details and remove artifacts in novel view renders and depth maps of a 3D scene. We introduce context and geometry conditioning using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation layers as a lightweight alternative to cross-attention and also propose a novel confidence measure for 3D Gaussian splat representations to allow for better detection of these artifacts. By progressively integrating these novel views in a Gaussian-SLAM-inspired process, we achieve a multi-view-consistent 3D representation. Evaluations on the MipNeRF360 and DL3DV-10K benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses existing pose-free techniques and performs competitively with state-of-the-art posed (precomputed camera parameters are given) reconstruction methods in complex 360 scenes.

This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weights required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore directly updating the quantized low-precision weights without relying on straight-through estimation during backpropagation, aiming to save memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize the information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models of various sizes indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values; (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits achieves performance on par with BitNet b1.58; (3) our models remain robust to precision scaling and memory reduction, showing minimal performance degradation when moving from FP32 to lower-memory environments (BF16/FP8); and (4) our models also support inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04787","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.832010","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Kaiyan Zhao, Tsuguchika Tabaru, Kenichi Kobayashi, Takumi Honda, Masafumi Yamazaki, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka","raw_content_length":1371,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BitNet"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1370,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Direct Quantized Training","Language Models","Stochastic Rounding","arXiv241204787v3 Announce Type","Abstract","recent quantized Large Language Models","LLMs","BitNet","the way","significant reduction"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Direct Quantized Training","recent quantized Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Direct Quantized Training":2.0,"Language Models":2.0,"Stochastic Rounding":2.0,"arXiv241204787v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"recent quantized Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"BitNet":1.0,"the way":1.0,"significant reduction":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7701363794444442,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9072,"joy":0.0052,"surprise":0.033,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.0115,"anger":0.0193,"disgust":0.0156},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents research on directly training quantized language models, potentially reducing memory usage during training.

This paper introduces a novel multilinear framework for quaternion arrays, which extends the classical tensor analysis to multidimensional quaternion data in a rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a new definition of quaternion tensors as $\\mathbb{H}\\mathbb{R}$-multilinear forms, addressing the challenges posed by the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. Within this framework, we establish the Tucker decomposition for quaternion tensors and develop a quaternion Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (Q-CPD). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the Q-CPD, including trivial ambiguities, complex equivalent models, and sufficient conditions for uniqueness. Additionally, we present two algorithms for computing the Q-CPD and demonstrate their effectiveness through numerical experiments.

Existing datasets are noisy and weakly compositional, limiting models' understanding of complex scenes, while scalable solutions for dense, high-quality annotations remain a challenge. We introduce Generate Any Scene, a data engine that systematically enumerates scene graphs representing the combinatorial array of possible visual scenes. Generate Any Scene dynamically constructs scene graphs of varying complexity from a structured taxonomy of objects, attributes, and relations. Given a sampled scene graph, Generate Any Scene translates it into a caption for text-to-image or text-to-video generation; it also translates it into a set of visual question answers that allow automatic evaluation and reward modeling of semantic alignment. Using Generate Any Scene, we first design a self-improving framework where models iteratively enhance their performance using generated data. Stable Diffusion v1.5 achieves an average 4% improvement over baselines and surpassing fine-tuning on CC3M. Second, we also design a distillation algorithm to transfer specific strengths from proprietary models to their open-source counterparts. Using fewer than 800 synthetic captions, we fine-tune Stable Diffusion v1.5 and achieve a 10% increase in TIFA score on compositional and hard concept generation. Third, we create a reward model to align model generation with semantic accuracy at a low cost. Using GRPO algorithm, we fine-tune SimpleAR-0.5B-SFT and surpass CLIP-based methods by +5% on DPG-Bench.
