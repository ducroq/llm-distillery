{"id":"positive_news_the_better_india_ff42b4d006b6","title":"Why is the South Side of Most Indian Cities More Expensive?","content":"Pull out a map of any Indian city — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, or even Lucknow — and you’ll likely notice a curious pattern: the southern part is almost always the more affluent, greener, and better-planned zone. But why? It’s a question that has more to do with history, geography, and urban planning than just real estate trends. Let’s start with wind During the Industrial Revolution, European cities grew rapidly and unevenly. As content creator CA Sarthak Ahuja explains in a viral video, “Most European cities developed westward. Winds in the northern hemisphere generally blow from west to east, which means pollution from factories spreads eastward. The poorer working-class communities settled downwind, while the wealthy chose the cleaner western parts.” This early pattern of pollution-driven segregation — rich in the west, poor in the east — became a template that spread to colonial and post-colonial cities around the world, including in India. Sunlight and the south-facing advantage Another subtle but powerful reason to factor in is sunlight. In the northern hemisphere, south-facing homes receive more sunlight, making them warmer, brighter, and naturally more desirable. Those who could afford it always preferred southern exposure. This preference for south-facing homes gradually translated into higher demand and higher land values, shaping urban planning and real estate pricing patterns for generations. Trade winds and coastal wealth In India, geography played its own role. Western and southern regions historically benefited from maritime trade. “When India started international trade, all the major ports — from Maharashtra to Kerala — were in the southwest, creating early economic hubs,” Ahuja adds. Cities like Mumbai and Kochi became centres of wealth, reinforcing the association between the West and South with prosperity. Beyond wind directions: The modern city logic But here’s the catch — wind direction isn’t the only reason. This same rule does not apply everywhere. As India urbanised rapidly after Independence, infrastructure, topography, and business growth began to shape where prosperity clustered, explains entrepreneur Saransh Anand in a LinkedIn post. In newer cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, the “south = rich” equation has more to do with planned expansion than colonial geography. In Bangalore, IT corridors such as Koramangala and Electronic City drove the southern boom. In Hyderabad, meanwhile, it’s the western corridor of Hitech City and Gachibowli that now houses the wealthy. Similarly, Pune’s western suburbs, Gurugram’s southern sectors, and Chennai’s OMR stretch all reflect how post-liberalisation development patterns, not old trade winds, dictate where affluence moves. So while geography and history laid the foundation, modern growth has rewritten the map of privilege. The “southern advantage” today is less about sunlight or clean air, and more about how cities expand — following opportunity, infrastructure, and aspiration wherever they go.

{"id":"positive_news_the_better_india_6a6cc8afd526","title":"Meet 5 Indians Who Built Profitable Flower Farms ‚Äî One Now Earns Rs 5 Crore a Year!","content":"Can a flower farm truly be more profitable than traditional crops like wheat and rice? For these five individuals, the answer is yes. From abandoning corporate jobs to turning their love for flowers into thriving businesses, these farmers are proving that with innovation, and determination, the world of flowers can bloom into a lucrative and sustainable venture. Here are the incredible journeys of these individuals, who have not only battled numerous challenges but have also redefined what it means to succeed in their respective fields. 1. Lohith Reddy Lohith Reddy, a 31-year-old from Bengaluru, left his promising tech career to pursue his passion for flower farming. After gaining experience on his cousin's rose farm, he launched his own venture in 2018, starting with gerberas and later diversifying into chrysanthemums. “I wanted a reliable source of income,” he shares. Lohith produces 1,500 bunches of chrysanthemums weekly. Today, his farm, Lohith Flora, generates Rs 7 lakh per month by producing 1,500 bunches of chrysanthemums weekly. His focus on quality and freshness, along with a cold chain system, has earned him a loyal customer base. “His flowers last up to seven days,” says wholesaler Ashok Agarwal. With over 20 employees, Lohith plans to expand further, aiming to deliver directly to customers’ homes. “It's soul-satisfying to be surrounded by flowers,” he smiles. Read his full story here. 2. Parvathy Mohanan Parvathy Mohanan, a 23-year-old software tester from Kochi, turned her love for portulaca flowers into a business during the 2020 lockdown. After posting pictures of her plants on Facebook, she received 10 orders, marking the start of her venture. “I thought of commercialising my collection,” she says. Now, with 300 varieties, she generates Rs 1 lakh a month from 50-100 orders daily. Parvathy Mohanan generates Rs 1 lakh a month from her flowers While working full-time, she manages the garden with two workers, having taught them all the required expertise. She ensures proper care for the plants, handling challenges such as excess rain during the monsoon season. Her business has strengthened family bonds, with her mother assisting with packaging. Parvathy encourages others to try farming, saying, “The key is to grow low-maintenance, high-demand plants.” Reflecting on her journey, she adds, “These plants are like my happy pills.” Read his full story here. 3. Srikanth Bollapally Srikanth Bollapally, a 40-year-old flower farmer from Bengaluru, built a successful floriculture business from humble beginnings. Growing up in a poor farming family, he moved to Bengaluru at 16 and worked in the floriculture industry. “It was determination and patience that led me to where I am today,” he says. Through hard work, Srikanth built a successful flower farm In 1997, he opened a flower shop and later expanded into farming, using savings and government loans to buy 10 acres of land, which has now grown to 52 acres. His farm generates Rs 70 crore in turnover and Rs 5 crore in annual profit. “If you play your cards right, there is a lot of money to be made in this industry,” he advises. Srikanth attributes his success to hard work and perseverance, stating, “I simply followed the path ahead of me and put in the effort.” Read his full story here. 4. Abhinav Singh Abhinav Singh, after completing his BTech and working at Microsoft, realised that despite living a luxurious life in England, he missed being close to his family. “Even though I felt happy, I never felt accomplished,” he says. In 2015, he returned to India and, after a year at Microsoft's Gurgaon office, he decided to pursue agriculture, a field his family had been involved in for generations. He chose gerbera cultivation, a flower in high demand during wedding seasons in Uttar Pradesh. Abhinav started gerbera cultivation after leaving his job at Microsoft. Abhinav began his venture with a government subsidy for setting up a polyhouse on one acre of land. “It took me around two years to get the project and loan approved,” he shares. In October 2020, he planted his first batch of gerberas, and by February 2021, he had his first harvest. Now, he sells around 2,000 flowers daily earning about Rs 1.5 lakh per month, with an annual income of Rs 18 lakh. Read his full story here. 5. Gurwinder Singh Sohi Gurwinder Singh Sohi, 45, from Punjab, switched from wheat farming to floriculture in 2008, realising that flower farming could yield two to three times the income. “Despite the hard work in wheat farming, farmers struggle. Floriculture offers better returns,” he explains. He grows 40 varieties of flowers across 22 acres in his village, earning Rs 1 lakh per acre. Gurwinder grows 40 varieties of exotic flowers like California poppy, gladiolus, and calendula. Initially starting with gladiolus, Gurwinder later developed a semi-automatic planting machine to reduce labour costs. “We can now plant bulbs in two hours instead of a day,” he says. His innovation has saved Rs 40,000 per acre and led to the sale of eight machines to farmers in India.

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

The efficacy of these judges depends on their chain-of-thought reasoning, creating a critical need for methods that can effectively optimize this reasoning process. In this work, we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning framework for teaching LLM judges to think before making decisions. Our core contribution lies in converting all judgment tasks for non-verifiable and verifiable prompts into a unified format with verifiable rewards, enabling direct optimization of evaluation quality while mitigating positional bias. We then use RL to train thinking-judges at scales of 8B, 32B, and 70B and show that they obtain state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. In particular, J1-Qwen-32B, our multitasked pointwise and pairwise judge also outperforms o1-mini, o3, and a much larger 671B DeepSeek-R1 on some benchmarks, while only training on synthetic data. Through comprehensive ablations of pairwise, pointwise, and multitask J1 variants, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across seed prompts, reward strategies, and training recipes. Qualitative analysis reveals that J1 develops systematic evaluation strategies, including dynamic criteria generation, reference answer creation, iterative self-correction of initial assessments, and feedback generation for low-quality responses.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10320","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.272487","language":"en","tags":["cscl","preprints","csai","cslg","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Chenxi Whitehouse, Tianlu Wang, Ping Yu, Xian Li, Jason Weston, Ilia Kulikov, Swarnadeep Saha","raw_content_length":1486,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Incentivizing Thinking in LLM-as","LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1485,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLM","Announce Type","Abstract","The progress","the quality","evaluation","powerful LLM","a-Judge","a core solution","The efficacy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLM":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The progress":1.0,"the quality":1.0,"evaluation":1.0,"powerful LLM":1.0,"a-Judge":1.0,"a core solution":1.0,"The efficacy":1.0}},"age_hours":9.220634132499999,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.5845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9169,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9006,"joy":0.0272,"surprise":0.0238,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0165,"anger":0.0199,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a reinforcement learning framework (J1) for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM judges.

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00895","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.307634","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","cslg","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Kyowoon Lee, Jaesik Choi","raw_content_length":1351,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["State-Covering Trajectory Stitching"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1350,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["State","Announce Type","Abstract","Diffusion-based generative models","powerful tools","long-horizon planning","reinforcement learning","offline datasets","their performance","the quality"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"State":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Diffusion-based generative models":1.0,"powerful tools":1.0,"long-horizon planning":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"offline datasets":1.0,"their performance":1.0,"the quality":1.0}},"age_hours":9.221737888333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.9844999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2031,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9195,"joy":0.0078,"surprise":0.0422,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0117,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel trajectory augmentation method (SCoTS) to improve the performance of diffusion planners in reinforcement learning.

In our framework, token embeddings evolve under a partial differential equation whose nonlocal integral term models self-attention, local reaction term models feed-forward layers, diffusion term encodes positional smoothing, and a stability control term corresponds to layer normalization. From this unifying perspective, we design an Adaptive PDE Diffusion Layer-an efficient, learnable finite-difference stencil that enforces local smoothness in feature space with linear time complexity and complements self-attention's global routing. Through a systematic theoretical analysis based on four pillars:stability, diffusion geometry, multi-scale dynamics, and component coupling, we derive principled guidelines for integrating the PDE layer at seven candidate points in the Transformer. Empirically, on the Long Range Arena benchmark, placing the layer immediately after embedding yields a 4.1 pp average accuracy gain over a strong baseline, and an adaptive multi-scale variant delivers further improvements.

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21750","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.367967","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Yang Wang, Chenghao Xiao, Yizhi Li, Stuart E.

Benchmarks currently used for contradiction detection lack domain realism, cover only limited conflict types, and rarely extend beyond single-sentence pairs, making them unsuitable for legal applications. Controlled generation of documents with embedded contradictions is therefore essential: it enables systematic stress-testing of models, ensures coverage of diverse conflict categories, and provides a reliable basis for evaluating contradiction detection and resolution. We present a multi-agent contradiction-aware benchmark framework for the legal domain that generates synthetic legal-style documents, injects six structured contradiction types, and models both self- and pairwise inconsistencies. Automated contradiction mining is combined with human-in-the-loop validation to guarantee plausibility and fidelity. This benchmark offers one of the first structured resources for contradiction-aware evaluation in legal RAG pipelines, supporting more consistent, interpretable, and trustworthy systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03418","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.436672","language":"en","tags":["csma","preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Ananya Mantravadi, Shivali Dalmia, Olga Pospelova, Abhishek Mukherji, Nand Dave, Anudha Mittal","raw_content_length":1271,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LegalWiz","Benchmarks","Retrieval-Augmented Generation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1270,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LegalWiz","Announce Type","Abstract","Retrieval-Augmented Generation","RAG","large language models","LLMs","external sources","unresolved contradictions","retrieved evidence"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["RAG"],"renewable_energy":["RAG"],"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LegalWiz":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation":1.0,"RAG":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"external sources":1.0,"unresolved contradictions":1.0,"retrieved evidence":1.0}},"age_hours":9.225719243055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.48650000000000027,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7068,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0439,"sadness":0.0499,"fear":0.1197,"anger":0.0234,"disgust":0.0504},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the reliability of legal RAG systems by addressing contradictions in retrieved information.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a uniquely promising solution, offering provable privacy and security guarantees. Unfortunately, computational cost is impeding its mass adoption. Modern solutions are up to six orders of magnitude slower than plaintext execution. Understanding and reducing this overhead is essential to the advancement of FHE, particularly as the underlying algorithms evolve rapidly. This paper presents a detailed characterization of OpenFHE, a comprehensive open-source library for FHE, with a particular focus on the CKKS scheme due to its significant potential for AI and machine learning applications. We introduce CryptOracle, a modular evaluation framework comprising (1) a benchmark suite, (2) a hardware profiler, and (3) a predictive performance model. The benchmark suite encompasses OpenFHE kernels at three abstraction levels: workloads, microbenchmarks, and primitives. The profiler is compatible with standard and user-specified security parameters. CryptOracle monitors application performance, captures microarchitectural events, and logs power and energy usage for AMD and Intel systems. These metrics are consumed by a modeling engine to estimate runtime and energy efficiency across different configuration scenarios, with error geomean of $-7.02\\%\\sim8.40\\%$ for runtime and $-9.74\\%\\sim15.67\\%$ for energy. CryptOracle is open source, fully modular, and serves as a shared platform to facilitate the collaborative advancements of applications, algorithms, software, and hardware in FHE.

We introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly, tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks. By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama. These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs, providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03669","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.437504","language":"en","tags":["cscl","preprints","cslg","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Wenlong Deng, Yi Ren, Yushu Li, Boying Gong, Danica J.

However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03813","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.437900","language":"en","tags":["csgr","cscv","preprints","csai","cslg","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Byungjun Kim, Soobin Um, Jong Chul Ye","raw_content_length":1403,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tweedie","Contrastive Noise Optimization"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1402,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Diverse Text","arXiv251003813v2 Announce Type","Abstract","image","T2I","impressive performance","high-fidelity images","text-guided inference","this advantage","a critical drawback"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Diverse Text":2.0,"arXiv251003813v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"image":1.0,"T2I":1.0,"impressive performance":1.0,"high-fidelity images":1.0,"text-guided inference":1.0,"this advantage":1.0,"a critical drawback":1.0}},"age_hours":9.225763508333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.131499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8936,"joy":0.018,"surprise":0.0481,"sadness":0.0173,"fear":0.0048,"anger":0.0085,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (Contrastive Noise Optimization) to improve the diversity of text-to-image diffusion models.

One type of such attack is the pilot contamination attack (PCA), where a malicious user copies pilot signals from an authentic user during uplink, intentionally interfering with the base station's (BS) channel estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose to use a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for PCA detection at the BS in a multi-user system. We present a methodology to generate training data for the DT classifier and select the best DT according to their depth. Then, we simulate different scenarios that could be encountered in practice and compare the DT to a classical technique based on likelihood ratio testing (LRT) submitted to the same scenarios. The results revealed that a DT with only one level of depth is sufficient to outperform the LRT. The DT shows a good performance regarding the probability of detection in noisy scenarios and when the malicious user transmits with low power, in which case the LRT fails to detect the PCA. We also show that the reason for the good performance of the DT is its ability to compute a threshold that separates PCA data from non-PCA data better than the LRT's threshold.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_18aed16716a1","title":"Early-Warning of Thunderstorm","content":"arXiv:2510.03959v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Thunderstorm-driven outages are difficult to predict because most storms do not cause damage, convective processes occur rapidly and chaotically, and the available public data are both noisy and incomplete. We develop a 24-48 h early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes, and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design, combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by hourly moving-block bootstrap. On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows (e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at +/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48 h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm outages.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03959","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.438771","language":"en","tags":["cslg","research","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Iryna Stanishevska","raw_content_length":1939,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the U.S. Department of Energy","Oak Ridge National Laboratory","k-NN"],"persons":[],"locations":["Michigan"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1936,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Early-Warning","Thunderstorm","arXiv251003959v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Thunderstorm-driven outages","most storms","damage","convective processes","the available public data","a 24-48 h early-warning model"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the available public data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Early-Warning":2.0,"Thunderstorm":2.0,"arXiv251003959v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Thunderstorm-driven outages":1.0,"most storms":1.0,"damage":1.0,"convective processes":1.0,"the available public data":1.0,"a 24-48 h early-warning model":1.0}},"age_hours":9.225796423055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.923500000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1847,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6291,"joy":0.0035,"surprise":0.0361,"sadness":0.0378,"fear":0.2599,"anger":0.0221,"disgust":0.0115},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a model for early warning of thunderstorm-related outages, using open-source data and machine learning.

However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\\textbf{15.97%}$ in accuracy.

While research confirms that LLMs can simulate emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight \"probes\" to read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable (they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing more transparent and aligned AI systems.

The agent must follow a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion, interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising, no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints. We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards: a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics, formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to 66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO.

Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04550","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.441214","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","research","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Pengfei He, Zhenwei Dai, Bing He, Hui Liu, Xianfeng Tang, Hanqing Lu, Juanhui Li, Jiayuan Ding, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Suhang Wang, Yue Xing, Jiliang Tang, Benoit Dumoulin","raw_content_length":1227,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TRAJECT-Bench","TRAJECT","TRAJECT arXiv:2510.04550v2 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1226,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","Abstract","Large language model","LLM-based agents","tool use","real-world tasks","existing works","the LLMs tool use capability","the final answers","the detailed tool usage trajectory"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large language model":1.0,"LLM-based agents":1.0,"tool use":1.0,"real-world tasks":1.0,"existing works":1.0,"the LLMs tool use capability":1.0,"the final answers":1.0,"the detailed tool usage trajectory":1.0}},"age_hours":9.225887662222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9523,"joy":0.0056,"surprise":0.0226,"sadness":0.003,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.0092,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' tool use capability.

However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner, which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks. Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent diffusion.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04573","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.441635","language":"en","tags":["cscl","preprints","csai","cslg","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Haoqiang Kang, Yizhe Zhang, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Nicklas Majamaki, Navdeep Jaitly, Yi-An Ma, Lianhui Qin","raw_content_length":1584,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VAE","Latent Diffusion Reasoner","Latent Diffusion Enhances","CoT","LLM"],"persons":["a Variational Autoencoder","LaDiR"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1583,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LaDiR","LLMs","Latent Diffusion","Text Reasoning","arXiv251004573v3 Announce Type","Large Language Models","their reasoning ability","thought","LLMs autoregressive decoding","the ability"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LaDiR":3.0,"LLMs":3.0,"Latent Diffusion":2.0,"Text Reasoning":2.0,"arXiv251004573v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"their reasoning ability":1.0,"thought":1.0,"LLMs autoregressive decoding":1.0,"the ability":1.0}},"age_hours":9.225902379722223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.088000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8176,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9231,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.014,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0108,"anger":0.0231,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI reasoning framework (LaDiR) that improves accuracy, diversity, and interpretability over existing methods on mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks.

To address this challenge, we propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely on problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically equivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on these data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To improve data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original query and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a sanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness and generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis and RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs. Subsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical factors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/AdaR.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04617","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.442015","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","research","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Zhejian Lai, Xiang Geng, Zhijun Wang, Yang Bai, Jiahuan Li, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai, Shujian Huang","raw_content_length":1317,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AdaR"],"persons":[],"locations":["mathemati"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1316,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mathematical Reasoning Adaptive","answers","arXiv251004617v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Mathematical reasoning","a primary indicator","large language models","LLMs intelligence","However existing LLMs exhibit failures","robustness"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mathematical Reasoning Adaptive":2.0,"answers":2.0,"arXiv251004617v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Mathematical reasoning":1.0,"a primary indicator":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs intelligence":1.0,"However existing LLMs exhibit failures":1.0,"robustness":1.0}},"age_hours":9.225916477222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.608499999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1217,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8679,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0165,"sadness":0.0108,"fear":0.0086,"anger":0.0456,"disgust":0.0439},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a framework (AdaR) to improve the mathematical reasoning of LLMs, aiming to reduce spurious reasoning.

Although prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection.

With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools.

This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising (a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that supports QCaaS.

The RQs investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04982","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.444457","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","csse","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Aakash Ahmad, Muhammad Waseem, Bakheet Aljedaani, Mahdi Fahmideh, Peng Liang, Feras Awaysheh","raw_content_length":1968,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum Computing","IBM","QuBits","Amazon Braket","Quantum"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1967,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantum Computing","a Service","Announce Type","Abstract","Quantum systems","a disruptive technology","platforms","the principles","quantum mechanics","programmable quantum bits"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantum Computing":2.0,"a Service":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Quantum systems":1.0,"a disruptive technology":1.0,"platforms":1.0,"the principles":1.0,"quantum mechanics":1.0,"programmable quantum bits":1.0}},"age_hours":9.226006912777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.76,"joy":0.1032,"surprise":0.0989,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.0161,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on the development of a reference architecture for Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS).

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_69df84b0549d","title":"Efficient Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environments with Vision","content":"arXiv:2510.04991v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about occupancy maps in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to yield more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \\cite{kondo2025dynus}, a state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms, corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\\% shorter paths on average.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04991","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.444845","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","csro","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"D.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6c1414560e90","title":"Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding","content":"arXiv:2510.05014v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05014","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.445246","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","cslg","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":212,"author":"Xuanming Cui, Jianpeng Cheng, Hong-you Chen, Satya Narayan Shukla, Abhijeet Awasthi, Xichen Pan, Chaitanya Ahuja, Shlok Kumar Mishra, Qi Guo, Ser-Nam Lim, Aashu Singh, Xiangjun Fan","raw_content_length":1602,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.06,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UME","Universal Multimodal Embeddings","Multimodal Large Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1601,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Embed","Generative Context","MLLMs","arXiv251005014v2 Announce Type","Abstract","a growing interest","Universal Multimodal Embeddings","UME","models","task-specific representations"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Embed"],"ai_ml":["MLLMs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Embed":2.0,"Generative Context":2.0,"MLLMs":2.0,"arXiv251005014v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a growing interest":1.0,"Universal Multimodal Embeddings":1.0,"UME":1.0,"models":1.0,"task-specific representations":1.0}},"age_hours":9.226037632222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.600999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9202,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9202,"joy":0.0115,"surprise":0.0334,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a novel framework (Think-Then-Embed) for improving multimodal embeddings using large language models.

While effective at learning relative preferences, this paradigm fails to capture a signal of response acceptability, leaving systems vulnerable to selecting the least bad of many unacceptable options. This is particularly problematic for hard prompts, where the risk of such false acceptances increases with the number of samples. In this paper, we address this critical reliability gap by introducing a new data collection and modeling framework. By augmenting preference data with an outside option, inspired by discrete choice models, we train a reward model that can distinguish not just what is better, but what is good enough. We leverage this capability to create an adaptive inference strategy, best of mini-N in-loop, which partitions the generation budget into sequential loops with a calibrated, early-exit condition. Our experiments show that when tuned as an alignment guardrail, it reduces reliability failures by 70%, and when tuned as an inference accelerator, it improves average inference speed by over 22% in IMDB-sentiment setting. We thus provide a principled and flexible framework for practitioners to explicitly manage the trade-off between reliability and computational efficiency.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04087","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T12:55:52.498777","language":"en","tags":["cslg","preprints","csai","statme","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":201,"author":"Hyung Gyu Rho, Sian Lee","raw_content_length":1400,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.005,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BoN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1399,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["mini","loop","A Contextual Quality Reward Model","Reliable","Efficient Best","arXiv251004087v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Modern preference alignment techniques","reward models","pairwise comparison data"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["pairwise comparison data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"mini":2.0,"loop":2.0,"A Contextual Quality Reward Model":2.0,"Reliable":2.0,"Efficient Best":2.0,"arXiv251004087v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Modern preference alignment techniques":1.0,"reward models":1.0,"pairwise comparison data":1.0}},"age_hours":9.227963726111112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.818,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9636,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6776,"joy":0.0069,"surprise":0.0245,"sadness":0.044,"fear":0.1444,"anger":0.0366,"disgust":0.0659},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new data collection and modeling framework to improve the reliability and efficiency of preference alignment techniques.
