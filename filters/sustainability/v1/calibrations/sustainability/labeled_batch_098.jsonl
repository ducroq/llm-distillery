Evidence from Chinese Cities","content":"As the fundamental spatial carriers of population and economic activities, cities are central to advancing Chinese-style modernization, making the enhancement of their comprehensive carrying capacity (CCP) an essential pathway toward sustainable development. Drawing on panel data from 284 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period of 2005–2022, this study constructs a dynamic spatial Durbin model to examine how different forms of industrial agglomeration influence urban CCP. The results indicate the following: (1) Urban CCP demonstrates significant spatial dependence across cities. (2) Both specialization and diversification exert pronounced spatiotemporal lag effects. Specifically, specialized agglomeration tends to suppress the urban CCP of both local and neighboring cities, whereas diversified agglomeration generally contributes to its improvement. (3) The spatiotemporal effects of specialized agglomeration and diversified agglomeration on urban CCP exhibit heterogeneity across regions and economic development levels. Diversified agglomeration significantly enhances the CCP of cities in the central region and those with higher economic development levels, while the western region and cities with lower economic development levels are more suited for industrial specialized agglomeration. (4) Further research has found that specialized agglomeration and diversified agglomeration have heterogeneous spatiotemporal effects on different dimensions of urban CCP. These findings suggest that governments at all levels should formulate differentiated industrial agglomeration strategies that align with local resource endowments and industrial foundations, thereby fostering high-quality urban development tailored to local conditions.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9064","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:21.582272","language":"en","tags":["open-access","environment","sustainability","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Feng Lan","raw_content_length":1772,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Diversified Agglomeration","Specialized","CCP"],"persons":["Durbin"],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1762,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Specialized","Diversified Agglomeration","Which","Urban Comprehensive Carrying Capacity","Evidence","Chinese Cities","the fundamental spatial carriers","population"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Specialized":2.0,"Diversified Agglomeration":2.0,"Which":2.0,"Urban Comprehensive Carrying Capacity":2.0,"Evidence":2.0,"Chinese Cities":2.0,"the fundamental spatial carriers":1.0,"population":1.0}},"age_hours":18.719651905,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.673,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7346,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.877,"joy":0.0282,"surprise":0.0374,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0125,"anger":0.0196,"disgust":0.0203},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes the impact of industrial agglomeration strategies on urban carrying capacity using panel data from 284 Chinese cities.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_1fda1096a222","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 4018: Comparative Analysis of Passkeys (FIDO2 Authentication) on Android and iOS for GDPR Compliance in Biometric Data Protection","content":"Biometric authentication, such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, is now standard on mobile devices, offering secure and convenient access. However, the processing of biometric data is tightly regulated under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), where such data qualifies as “special category” personal data when used for uniquely identifying individuals. Compliance requires meeting strict conditions, including explicit consent and data protection by design. Passkeys, the modern name for FIDO2-based authentication credentials developed by the FIDO Alliance, enable passwordless login using public key cryptography. Its “match-on-device” architecture stores biometric data locally in secure hardware (e.g., Android’s Trusted Execution Environment, Apple’s Secure Enclave), potentially reducing the regulatory obligations associated with cloud-based biometric processing. This paper examines how Passkeys are implemented on Android and iOS platforms and their differences in architecture, API access, and hardware design, and how those differences affect compliance with the GDPR. Through a comparative analysis, we evaluate the extent to which each platform supports local processing, data minimization, and user control—key principles under GDPR. We find that while both platforms implement strong local protections, differences in developer access, trust models, and biometric isolation can influence the effectiveness and regulatory exposure of Passkeys deployment. These differences have direct implications for privacy risk, legal compliance, and implementation choices by app developers and service providers. Our findings highlight the need for platform-aware design and regulatory interpretation in the deployment of biometric authentication technologies. This work can help inform stakeholders, policymakers, and legal experts in drafting robust privacy and ethical policies—not only in the realm of biometrics but across AI technologies more broadly. By understanding platform-level implications, future frameworks can better align technical design with regulatory compliance and ethical standards.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4018","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:22.262004","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":280,"author":"Shahram Latifi","raw_content_length":2241,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.4,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["General Data Protection Regulation","GDPR Compliance","the FIDO Alliance","the European Union’s","FIDO2","Trusted Execution Environment","Android","Biometric Data Protection","Apple’s Secure Enclave"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2151,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Comparative Analysis","Passkeys","FIDO2 Authentication","Android","iOS","GDPR Compliance","Biometric Data Protection","Biometric authentication"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Comparative Analysis":2.0,"Passkeys":2.0,"FIDO2 Authentication":2.0,"Android":2.0,"iOS":2.0,"GDPR Compliance":2.0,"Biometric Data Protection":2.0,"Biometric authentication":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72063478277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.818,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0072,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0832,"anger":0.0393,"disgust":0.0396},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the implementation of Passkeys on Android and iOS for GDPR compliance, focusing on biometric data protection.

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_7148b936abdc","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 4016: AnomalyNLP: Noisy","content":"Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FSIAD) is an essential yet challenging problem in practical scenarios such as industrial quality inspection. Its objective is to identify previously unseen anomalous regions using only a limited number of normal support images from the same category. Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have exhibited remarkable few-shot image-text representation abilities across a range of visual tasks, including anomaly detection. Despite their promise, real-world industrial anomaly datasets often contain noisy labels, which can degrade prompt learning and detection performance. In this paper, we propose AnomalyNLP, a new Noisy-Label Prompt Learning approach designed to tackle the challenge of few-shot anomaly detection. This framework offers a simple and efficient approach that leverages the expressive representations and precise alignment capabilities of VLMs for industrial anomaly detection. First, we design a Noisy-Label Prompt Learning (NLPL) strategy. This strategy utilizes feature learning principles to suppress the influence of noisy samples via Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall model robustness. Furthermore, we introduce a prompt-driven optimal transport feature purification method to accurately partition datasets into clean and noisy subsets. For both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection, AnomalyNLP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various few-shot settings on the MVTecAD and VisA public datasets. Qualitative and quantitative results on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the largest average AUC improvement over baseline methods across 1-, 2-, and 4-shot settings, with gains of up to 10.60%, 10.11%, and 9.55% in practical anomaly detection scenarios.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4016","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:22.262696","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Jin Qian","raw_content_length":1847,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CLIP","Noisy Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection","Noisy-Label Prompt Learning","AnomalyNLP"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1847,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","AnomalyNLP","Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection","FSIAD","an essential yet challenging problem","practical scenarios","industrial quality inspection","Its objective","previously unseen anomalous regions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AnomalyNLP"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"AnomalyNLP":2.0,"Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection":1.0,"FSIAD":1.0,"an essential yet challenging problem":1.0,"practical scenarios":1.0,"industrial quality inspection":1.0,"Its objective":1.0,"previously unseen anomalous regions":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72066540361111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6334,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0287,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.231,"anger":0.0371,"disgust":0.057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new approach (AnomalyNLP) for anomaly detection in industrial quality inspection using vision-language models.

Existing studies have primarily relied on single modalities (text or facial expressions). They often perform static emotion classification at specific time points. This approach limits their ability to capture abrupt emotional shifts or the structural patterns of emotional flow within dialogues. To address these limitations, this paper utilizes the MELD dataset to construct emotion sequences based on the order of utterances and introduces an analytical approach using Sequential Pattern Mining (SPM). Facial expressions are detected using DeepFace, while speech is transcribed with Whisper and passed through a BERT-based emotion classifier to infer emotions. The proposed method fuses multimodal results through a weighted voting scheme to generate emotion label sequences for each utterance. These sequences are then used to construct an emotion transition matrix, apply change-point detection, perform SPM, and train an LSTM-based classification model to predict the overall emotional flow of the dialogue. This approach goes beyond single-point judgments by capturing the contextual flow and dynamics of emotions and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods through experimental validation.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4015","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:22.263002","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Kyungyong Chung","raw_content_length":1515,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MELD","Speech","BERT","Sequential Pattern Mining","DeepFace"],"persons":["Whisper","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1515,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pages","Speech","facial expressions","text","a multimodal emotion recognition framework","speech transcription","the transcribed speech","a particular focus","the continuous changes","transitions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pages":2.0,"Speech":2.0,"facial expressions":2.0,"text":2.0,"a multimodal emotion recognition framework":1.0,"speech transcription":1.0,"the transcribed speech":1.0,"a particular focus":1.0,"the continuous changes":1.0,"transitions":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72067946111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5423,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9359,"joy":0.0032,"surprise":0.008,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0119,"anger":0.014,"disgust":0.0234},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel method for emotion recognition using multimodal data.

However, with access to a large number of new energy sources, the scale of the distribution network continues to expand, and its topology becomes increasingly complex, leading to potential security risks in scheduling operations. Therefore, it is very important to carry out risk assessments before scheduling operations. In this paper, risk theory is introduced into the field of distribution network scheduling operations, and a new risk assessment method is proposed considering various uncertain factors in the distribution network. In order to comprehensively analyze the influence of uncertainty factors in the operational process of a new distribution network, the output probability models of wind power, photovoltaic power, and load are first constructed in this study. Then, the improved Latin hypercube sampling method is used to extract the operating state of the distribution network system from the probability model, and the node voltage over-limit and line power flow overload are used as indicators to measure the severity of the consequences so as to establish a quantitative scheduling operation risk assessment system and analyze its framework in detail. Finally, simulation analysis is carried out in the improved IEEE-RTS79 test system: taking 15–25 lines from the operation state to the maintenance state as an example, this paper analyzes the influence of different locations and capacities of wind and solar access on the scheduling operation risk of distribution networks.

In this research, we present a leakage-safe Calibrated Global Logit Fusion (CGLF) framework that couples TabNet’s sparse, attention-based feature selection with XGBoost’s gradient-boosted rules and fuses their class probabilities through global logit blending followed by per-class vector temperature calibration. Class imbalance is addressed with SMOTE–Tomek for TabNet and one XGBoost stream (XGB–A), and class-weighted training for a second stream (XGB–B). To prevent information leakage, all preprocessing, resampling, and weighting are fitted only on the training split within each outer fold. Out-of-fold (OOF) predictions from the outer-train split are then used to optimize blend weights and fit calibration parameters, which are subsequently applied once to the corresponding held-out outer-test fold. Our calibration-guided logit fusion (CGLF) matches top-tier discrimination on the public Fetal Health dataset while producing more reliable probability estimates than strong standalone baselines. Under nested cross-validation, CGLF delivers comparable AUROC and overall accuracy to the best tree-based model, with visibly improved calibration and slightly lower balanced accuracy in some splits. We also provide interpretability and overfitting checks via TabNet sparsity, feature stability analysis, and sufficiency (k95) curves. Finally, threshold tuning under a balanced-accuracy floor preserves sensitivity to pathological cases, aligning operating points with risk-aware obstetric decision support. Overall, CGLF is a calibration-centric, leakage-controlled CTG pipeline that is interpretable and suited to threshold-based clinical deployment.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/20/4013","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:22.264031","language":"en","tags":["open-access","engineering","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Juntae Kim","raw_content_length":1837,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["XGBoost","CGLF","XGB","TabNet","OOF","Fetal Health Classification Using Cardiotocographic Data Accurate"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1787,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","Calibrated Global Logit Fusion","CGLF","Fetal Health Classification","Cardiotocographic Data","TabNet","Accurate detection","fetal distress","cardiotocography"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Cardiotocographic Data","cardiotocography"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Calibrated Global Logit Fusion":2.0,"CGLF":2.0,"Fetal Health Classification":2.0,"Cardiotocographic Data":2.0,"TabNet":2.0,"Accurate detection":1.0,"fetal distress":1.0,"cardiotocography":1.0}},"age_hours":18.72072761888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.8449999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.431,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4732,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0089,"sadness":0.0298,"fear":0.4445,"anger":0.0145,"disgust":0.024},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework (CGLF) for fetal health classification using cardiotocographic data.

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_a246d00d7f7e","title":"Next","content":"Walk into a typical data center and one of the first things that jumps out at you is the noise—the low, buzzing sound of thousands of fans: fans next to individual computer chips, fans on the back panels of server racks, fans on the network switches. All of those fans are pushing hot air away from the temperature-sensitive computer chips and toward air-conditioning units.But those fans, whirr as they might, are no longer cutting it. Over the past decade, the power density of the most advanced computer chips has exploded. In 2017, Nvidia came out with the V100 GPU, which draws 300 watts of power. Most of that power dissipates back out as heat. Three years later, in 2020, Nvidia’s A100 came out, drawing up to 400 W. The now-popular H100 arrived in 2022 and consumes up to 700 W. The newest Blackwell GPUs, revealed in 2024, consume up to 1,200 W.“Road maps are looking at over 2,000 watts [per chip] over the next year or two,” says Drew Matter, president and CEO of the liquid-cooling company Mikros Technologies. “In fact, the industry is preparing for 5-kilowatt chips and above in the foreseeable future.”This power explosion is driven by the obvious culprit—AI. And all the extra computations consuming all that added power from advanced chips are generating unmanageable amounts of heat.“The average power density in a rack was around 8 kW,” says Josh Claman, CEO of the startup Accelsius. “For AI, that’s growing to 100 kW per rack. That’s an order of magnitude. It’s really AI adoption that’s creating this real urgency” to figure out a better way to cool data centers.Specifically, the urgency is to move away from fans and toward some sort of liquid cooling. For example, water has roughly four times the specific heat of air and is about 800 times as dense, meaning it can absorb around 3,200 times as much heat as a comparable volume of air can. What’s more, the thermal conductivity of water is 23.5 times as high as that of air, meaning that heat transfers to water much more readily.“You can stick your hand into a hot oven and you won’t get burned. You stick your hand into a pot of boiling water and you can instantly get third-degree burns,” says Seamus Egan, general manager of immersion cooling at Airedale by Modine. “That’s because the liquid transfers heat much, much, much, much more quickly.”The data-center industry by and large agrees that cooling chips with liquid is the future, at least for AI-focused data centers. “As AI has made racks denser and hotter, liquid cooling has become the de facto solution,” Karin Overstreet, president of Nortek Data Center Cooling, said via email.But there are a number of ways to do liquid cooling, from the simple and straightforward to the complex and slightly weird.At the simple end, there’s circulating chilled water through cold plates attached to the hottest chips. Then there’s circulating not water but a special dielectric fluid that boils inside the cold plate to take away the heat. A third approach is dunking the entire server into a fluid that keeps it cool. And, last and most splashy, is dunking the server into a boiling vat of liquid.Which method will end up being the industry standard for the high-end AI factories of the future? At this point, it’s anyone’s guess. Here’s how the four methods work, and where they might find the most use.#1: Single-Phase Direct-to-Chip CoolingThe most technologically mature approach is to use water. Already, many AI data centers are employing such direct-to-chip liquid cooling for their hottest chips.In this scheme, metal blocks, called cold plates, with channels in them for coolant to circulate, are placed directly on top of the chips. The cold plates match the size of the chips and go inside the server. The liquid is usually water, with some glycol added to prevent bacterial growth, stabilize the temperature, protect against freezing and corrosion, and increase the viscosity of the liquid. The glycol-water mixture is forced through the cold plate, whisking away heat right from the source. Companies like Mikros Technologies are pursuing single-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling. In this technique, a cold plate is placed on top of the hottest chips. Liquid is circulated through the cold plate, whisking away heat. Marvell TechnologyThe glycol water is normally kept in a closed loop, circulating from the cold plates to a heat-exchange unit, which cools the liquid back down, and then back to the cold plate. Inside the heat exchanger, a separate loop of “facility water” is used to cool down the glycol water. The facility water is in turn cooled by either a chiller—an electrically powered refrigeration unit—or a dry cooler, an outdoor unit that uses fans to blow ambient air over the water as it moves through pipes. A dry cooler is much simpler and more energy efficient than a chiller, but it works only in cooler climates—it can’t cool the water below the ambient temperature.One difficulty with this approach is that putting a cold plate on every single heat-producing component in a server is unfeasible. It only makes sense to put cold plates on the most energy-dense components—namely GPUs and some CPUs—leaving smaller components, like power supplies and memory units, to be cooled the old-fashioned way, with fans.“The trend is moving toward a hybrid-cooling solution,” Overstreet says. “So liquid cooling does about 80 percent of the cooling for the server room or the data hall, and about 20 percent is the existing air-cooling solution.”#2: Two-Phase Direct-to-Chip CoolingWith GPU power densities showing no signs of leveling off, direct-to-chip water cooling is hitting a limit. You can, of course, increase the flow of water, but that will use more energy. Or you can operate the chips at a higher temperature, which will cut into their performance and in the long run degrade the chips. Fortunately, there’s a third option: to squeeze a bit more out of the physics of heat exchange.The extra cooling power offered by physics comes from latent heat—that is, the energy it takes to change phase, in this case from liquid to gas. As the liquid boils off the GPU, it absorbs that extra latent heat as it turns into gas, without increasing temperature. Companies like Accelsius are proposing two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling. Here, a cold plate is also placed on top of the hottest chips, and the liquid circulating through the cold plate boils directly atop the chip. Big Idea ProductionsThat’s basically how two-phase direct-to-chip cooling works. In this scheme, a specially formulated dielectric liquid circulates through cold plates sitting atop high-energy chips and boils into vapor. The vapor is then fed back to a heat exchanger, which cools the fluid using facility water.“It’s really boiling to cool,” says My Truong, chief technology officer of the startup ZutaCore, which makes two-phase direct-to-chip cooling systems.Water boils at 100 °C (at atmospheric pressure), which is too high for proper chip operation. So you need a specially formulated fluid with a lower boiling point. ZutaCore’s chief evangelist, Shahar Belkin, explains that the fluid they use is sourced from chemical suppliers like Honeywell and Chemours, and boils at a temperature as low as 18 °C, which can be adjusted up or down by tweaking the pressure in the loop. In addition, the fluid is dielectric—it’s not electrically charged unless polarized by an external electric field. So, unlike water, if some of the fluid spills onto the electronics, it won’t damage the costly equipment.With water, the temperature increases drastically as it flows over the hot chips. That means the incoming water needs to be kept cold, and so the facility water requires cooling with chillers in most climates.With boiling dielectric fluid, however, the fluid remains roughly the same temperature and simply changes phase into a vapor. That means both the liquid and the facility water can be kept at a higher temperature, resulting in significant energy savings. When liquid boils on top of a hot chip, the chip is cooled not only through contact with the cooler liquid, but also through the latent heat it takes to induce a phase change. Accelsius“Because of the really efficient boiling process that happens on the cold plate, we can accept facility water that’s 6 to 8 degrees warmer than [with] single phase,” says Lucas Beran, director of product marketing at Accelsius, another startup working on two-phase direct-to-chip liquid cooling.The two-phase setup also requires lower liquid flow rates than the traditional single-phase water approach, so it uses less energy and runs less risk of damaging the equipment. The flow rate of two-phase cooling is about one-fifth that of single-phase cooling, Belkin says.With single-phase water cooling, he says, “you’ll have to flow a gallon per minute into the cold plate” for the most advanced chips running at 2,000 W. “This means very, very high pressure, very, very high flow. It means that pumping will be expensive, and [the cooling system] will actually harm itself with the high flow.”#3: Single-Phase Immersion CoolingDirect-to-chip liquid cooling offers much more cooling capacity than just blowing air, but it still relies on cold plates as intermediaries to do the cooling.What if you could bypass the cold plate altogether and just dunk the entire computer server in coolant? Some companies are doing just that.In this approach, the data center is arranged around immersion tanks rather than racks, each tank roughly the size of a refrigerator. The immersion tanks are filled with a dielectric fluid, usually an oil, which must be nonconductive and have strong thermal transfer properties, says Rachel Bielstein, global sales manager of immersion cooling at Baltimore Aircoil Co. The fluid also requires long-term stability and low environmental and fire risk. Sustainable Metal Cloud is advocating for single-phase immersion cooling, in which an entire server is submerged in a vat of liquid to keep it cool.Firmus TechnologiesWith immersion cooling, everything gets cooled by the same fluid. After the oil has whisked away the heat, there are various approaches to cooling the immersion fluid. Baltimore Aircoil, for one, has designed a heat exchanger that circulates facility water through coils and plates inside the tank, Bielstein explains. “The heated water is then pumped to an outside cooler that releases the heat into the air, cools the water, and sends it back to the heat exchanger to absorb more heat from the tank. This process uses up to 51 percent less energy versus traditional designs.”The team at Singapore-based Sustainable Metal Cloud (SMC), which builds immersion-cooling systems for data centers, has figured out the modifications that need to be made to servers to make them compatible with this cooling method. Beyond removing the built-in fans, the company swaps out the thermal-interface materials that connect chips to their heat sinks, as some of those materials degrade in the oil. Oliver Curtis, co-CEO of SMC and its sister company Firmus, told IEEE Spectrum the modifications they make are small but important to the functioning of SMC’s setup.“We’ve created the perfect operating environment for a computer,” Curtis says. “There’s no dust, no movement, no vibration, because there’s no fans. And it’s a perfect operating temperature.”There are some chips whose power density is still too high to be completely cooled by the slow-moving oil. In those cases, it’s necessary to add cold plates to increase the oil flow over them. “Single-phase immersion has already hit the limits” for cooling these advanced chips, says Egan of Airedale by Modine. Adding cold plates to immersion cooling, he says, “will definitely provide support for more advanced chip architectures and reduce the heat load on the single-phase dielectric fluid. The new challenge is that I now need two separate cooling-loop systems.”#4: Two-Phase Immersion CoolingIf no one cooling method is enough on its own, how about putting all of them together, and dunking your data center into a vat of boiling oil?Some companies already are.“Two-phase immersion is probably the most moon-shot technology when it comes to data-center liquid cooling,” says Beran, of Accelsius.But Brandon Marshall, global marketing manager of data-center liquid cooling at Chemours, says this is where the industry is headed. “We believe from the research that we’ve done that two-phase immersion is going to come up in a pretty reasonable way.” At their lab in Newark, Del., the Chemours team is developing a specially formulated liquid for two-phase immersion cooling. In this approach, the server is dunked into a vat of liquid, and the liquid boils atop the hot components, cooling the system. ChemoursMarshall argues that a two-phase—also known as boiling—liquid has 10 to 100 times as much cooling capacity as a single-phase liquid, due to its latent heat. And while two-phase direct-to-chip cooling may work for the chips of today, it still leaves many components, such as memory modules and power supplies, to be air cooled. As CPUs and GPUs grow more powerful, these memory modules and power supplies will also require liquid cooling.“That list of problems is not going anywhere,” Marshall says. “I think the immersion-cooling piece is going to continue to grow in interest as we move forward. People are going to get more comfortable with having a two-phase fluid inside of a rack just like they have [with] putting water in a rack through single-phase direct-to-chip technology.”In their lab in Newark, Del., the Chemours team has placed several high-power servers in tanks filled with a proprietary, specially formulated fluid. The fluid is dielectric, so as not to cause shorts, and it’s also noncorrosive and designed to boil at the precise temperature at which the chips are to be held. The fluid boils directly on top of the hot chips. Then the vapor condenses on a cooled surface, either at the top or the back panel of the tank. In their lab in Newark, Dela., the Chemours team is testing their two-phase immersion cooling fluid. In this approach, the whole server is dunked into a tank with dielectric liquid. The heat from the server boils the liquid, resulting in cooling. ChemoursThat condenser is cooled with circulating facility water. “All we need is water sent directly to the tank that’s about 6 degrees lower than our boiling point, so about 43 °C,” Marshall says. “The fluid condenses [back to a liquid] right inside of the tank. The temperature required to condense our fluid can eliminate the need for chillers and other complex mechanical infrastructure in most cases.”According to a recent case study by Chemours researchers, two-phase immersion cooling is more cost effective than single-phase immersion or single-phase direct-to-chip in most climates. For example, in Ashburn, Va., the 10-year total cost of ownership was estimated at US $436 million for a single-phase direct-to-chip setup, $491 million for a single-phase immersion setup, and $433 million for a two-phase immersion-cooling setup, mostly due to lower power requirements and a simplified mechanical system.Critics argue that two-phase immersion makes it hard to maintain the equipment, especially since the oils are so specialized, expensive, and prone to evaporating. “When you’re in an immersion tank, and there’s dollar signs evaporating from it, that can make it a bit of a challenge to service,” Beran says.However, Egan of Airedale by Modine says his company has developed a way to mostly avoid this issue with its immersion tanks, which are intended for edge applications. “Our EdgeBox is specifically designed to maintain the vapor layer lower down in the tank with a layer of air above it and closer to the tank lid. When the tank is opened (for a short maintenance period), the vapor layer does not ‘flow out’ of the tank,” Egan wrote via email. “The vapor is much heavier than air and therefore stays lower in the tank. The minimal vapor loss is offset by a buffer tank of fluid within the system.”For the foreseeable future, people in the industry agree that the power demands of AI will keep going up, and the need for cooling along with them.“Unless the floor falls out from under AI and everybody stops building these AI clusters, and stops building the hardware to perform training for large language models, we’re going to need to keep advancing cooling, and we’re going to need to solve the heat problem,” Marshall says.Which cooling technology will dominate in the coming AI factories? It’s too soon to say. But the rapidly changing nature of data centers is opening up the field to a lot of inventiveness and innovation.“There’s not only a great market for liquid cooling,” says Drew Matter, of Mikros Technologies, “but it’s also a fun engineering problem.”","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-liquid-cooling","published_date":"2025-10-13T15:00:03","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:22.803264","language":"en","tags":["data_centers","industry","technology","liquid_cooling","energy_efficiency","immersion_cooling","ieee","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE Spectrum","source_category":"science","word_count":2744,"author":"Dina Genkina","raw_content_length":22173,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":13.72,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Next Walk"],"persons":["Drew Matter","Blackwell"],"locations":["Nvidia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":16857,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["those fans","a typical data center","the first things","you","the noise","sound","thousands","fans","individual computer chips","the back panels"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"those fans":2.0,"a typical data center":1.0,"the first things":1.0,"you":1.0,"the noise":1.0,"sound":1.0,"thousands":1.0,"fans":1.0,"individual computer chips":1.0,"the back panels":1.0}},"age_hours":3.72041344,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.1885,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1623,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6815,"joy":0.0086,"surprise":0.2138,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.029,"anger":0.0244,"disgust":0.0381},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the deployment of liquid cooling technologies in data centers to address the increasing heat generated by AI chips.

{"id":"science_ieee_spectrum_online_cda3b9783333","title":"Artificial Neurons Talk Directly to Living Cells in a First","content":"The bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens came from humble beginnings; it was first isolated from dirt in a ditch in Norman, Oklahoma. But now, the surprisingly remarkable microbes are the key to the first ever artificial neurons that can directly interact with living cells.G. sulfurreducens communicate with each other through tiny, protein-based wires that researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have harvested and used to make artificial neurons that can, for the first time, process information from living cells without an intermediary device amplifying or modulating the signals, the researchers say.While some artificial neurons already exist, they require electronic amplification to sense the signals our bodies produce, explains Jun Yao, who works on bioelectronics and nanoelectronics at UMass Amherst. The amplification inflates both power usage and circuit complexity, and so counters efficiencies found in the brain.Yao’s team’s neuron can understand the body’s signals at their natural amplitude of around 0.1 volts. This “is highly novel,” says Bozhi Tian, a biophysicist who studies living bioelectronics at The University of Chicago and was not involved in the work. This work “bridges the long-standing gap between electronic and biological signaling” and demonstrates interaction between artificial neurons and living cells that Tian calls “unprecedented.”Real neurons and artificial neuronsBiological neurons are the fundamental building blocks of the brain. If external stimuli are strong enough, charge builds up in a neuron, triggering an action potential, a spike of voltage that travels down the neuron’s body to enable all types of bodily functions, including emotion and movement.Scientists have been working to engineer a synthetic neuron for decades, chasing after the efficiency of the human brain, which have so far seemed to escape the abilities of electronics.Yao’s group has designed new artificial neurons that mimic how biological neurons sense and react to electrical signals. They use sensors to monitor external biochemical changes and memristors—essentially resistors with memory—to emulate the action potential process. As voltage from the external biochemical events increases, ions accumulate and begin to form a filament across a gap in the memristor—which in this case was filled with protein nanowires. If there is enough voltage, the filament completely bridges the gap. Current shoots through the device, and the filament then dissolves, dispersing the ions and stopping the current. The complete process mimics a neuron’s action potential. The team tested its artificial neurons by connecting them to cardiac tissue. The devices measured a baseline amount of cellular contraction, which did not produce enough signal to cause the artificial neuron to fire. Then the researchers took another measurement after the tissue was dosed with norepinephrine—a drug that increases how frequently cells contract. The artificial neurons only triggered action potentials during the higher, medicated trial, proving that they can detect changes in living cells. The experimental results were published 29 September in Nature Communications.Natural nanowiresThe group has G. sulfurreducens to thank for the breakthrough. The microbes synthesize miniature cables, called protein nanowires, that they use for intraspecies communication. These cables are charge conductors that survive for long periods of time in the wild without decaying. (Remember, they evolved for Oklahoma ditches.) They’re extremely stable, even for device fabrication, Yao says.To the engineers, the most notable property of the nanowires is how efficiently ions move along them. The nanowires offered a low energy means of transferring charge between human cells and artificial neurons, thus avoiding the need for a separate amplifier or modulator. “And amazingly, the material is designed for this,” says Yao.The group developed a method to shear the cables off of bacterial bodies, purifying the material and suspending it in a solution. They lay the mixture out and let the water evaporate, leaving a one-molecule-thin film made from the protein nanowire material.This efficiency allows the artificial neuron to yield huge power savings. Yao’s group integrated the film into the memristor at the core of the neuron, lowering the energy barrier for the reaction that causes the memristor to respond to signals recognized by the sensor. With this innovation, the researchers say, the artificial neuron uses 1/10th the voltage and 1/100th the power of others. Chicago’s Tian thinks this “extremely impressive” energy efficiency is “essential for future low-power, implantable, and biointegrated computing systems.”The power advantages make this synthetic neuron design attractive for all kinds of applications, researchers say. Responsive wearable electronics, like prosthetics that adapt to stimuli from the body, could make use of these new artificial neurons, Tian says. Eventually, implantable systems that rely on the neurons could “learn like living tissues, advancing personalized medicine and brain-inspired computing” to “interpret physiological states, leading to biohybrid networks that merge electronics with living intelligence,” he says.The artificial neurons could also be useful in electronics outside the biomedical field. Millions of them on a chip could replace transistors, completing the same tasks while decreasing power usage, Yao says. The fabrication process for the neurons does not involve high temperatures and utilizes the same kind of photolithography silicon chip manufacturers do, he says.Yao does, however, point out two possible bottlenecks producers could face when scaling up these artificial neurons for electronics. The first is obtaining more of the protein nanowires from G. sulfurreducens. His lab currently works for three days to generate only 100 micrograms of material—that’s about the mass of one grain of table salt. And that amount can only coat a very small device, so Yao questions how this step in the process could scale up for production. His other concern is how to achieve a uniform coating of the film at the scale of a silicon wafer. “If you wanted to make high-density, small devices, the uniformity of film thickness actually is a critical parameter,” he explains. But the artificial neurons his group has developed are too small to do any meaningful uniformity testing for now. Tian doesn’t expect artificial neurons to replace silicon transistors in conventional computing, but instead sees them as a parallel offering for “hybrid chips that merge biological adaptability with electronic precision,” he says.In the far future, Yao hopes that such bio-derived devices will also be appreciated for not contributing to e-waste. When a user no longer wants a device, they can simply dump the biological component in the surrounding environment, Yao says, because it won’t cause an environmental hazard. “By using this kind of nature-derived, microbial material, we can create a greener technology that’s more sustainable for the world,” Yao says.","source":"science_ieee_spectrum_online","source_type":"rss","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-neuron","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:04","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:22.805601","language":"en","tags":["artificial_neurons","wearables","bacteria","engineering","memristor","industry","technology","ieee","neurons","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"IEEE Spectrum","source_category":"science","word_count":1056,"author":"Perri Thaler","raw_content_length":8870,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":5.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UMass Amherst","the University of Massachusetts Amherst","Artificial Neurons Talk Directly","Living Cells"],"persons":["Jun Yao","Geobacter"],"locations":["Oklahoma","Norman"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":7124,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Artificial Neurons Talk","Living Cells","The bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens","humble beginnings","dirt","a ditch","Norman","Oklahoma","the surprisingly remarkable microbes","the key"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Artificial Neurons Talk":2.0,"Living Cells":2.0,"The bacteria Geobacter sulfurreducens":1.0,"humble beginnings":1.0,"dirt":1.0,"a ditch":1.0,"Norman":1.0,"Oklahoma":1.0,"the surprisingly remarkable microbes":1.0,"the key":1.0}},"age_hours":4.720151045833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7345,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7469,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5709,"joy":0.0222,"surprise":0.3618,"sadness":0.0031,"fear":0.0087,"anger":0.0143,"disgust":0.019},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes the creation of artificial neurons using protein nanowires from Geobacter sulfurreducens.

Vaccine opt-outs and refusals are often fueled by beliefs concerning perceptions of vaccine effectiveness and exaggerated risks. Here, we quantify the impact of competing beliefs – vaccine-averse versus vaccine-neutral – on social imitation dynamics of vaccination, alongside the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission. These beliefs may be pre-existing and fixed, or coevolving attitudes. This interplay among beliefs, behaviors, and disease dynamics demonstrates that individuals are not perfectly rational; rather, they base their vaccine uptake decisions on beliefs, personal experiences, and social influences. We find that the presence of a small proportion of fixed vaccine-averse beliefs can significantly exacerbate the vaccination dilemma, making the tipping point in the hysteresis loop more sensitive to changes in individuals’ perceived costs of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. However, in scenarios where competing beliefs spread concurrently with vaccination behavior, their double-edged impact can lead to self-correction and alignment between vaccine beliefs and behaviors. The results show that coevolution of vaccine beliefs and behaviors makes populations more sensitive to abrupt changes in perceptions of vaccine cost and effectiveness compared to scenarios without beliefs. Our work provides valuable insights into harnessing the social contagion of even vaccine-neutral attitudes to overcome vaccine hesitancy.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013586","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:50.658739","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Xingru Chen","raw_content_length":1720,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Ran Zhuo","Feng Fu","Xingru Chen Declines"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1712,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["vaccine effectiveness","beliefs","Social imitation dynamics","vaccination","Feng Fu","Ran Zhuo","vaccination coverage","vaccine-preventable diseases","measles","chickenpox"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"vaccine effectiveness":3.0,"beliefs":3.0,"Social imitation dynamics":2.0,"vaccination":2.0,"Feng Fu":1.0,"Ran Zhuo":1.0,"vaccination coverage":1.0,"vaccine-preventable diseases":1.0,"measles":1.0,"chickenpox":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725704531111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0984,"joy":0.0133,"surprise":0.8252,"sadness":0.0024,"fear":0.0419,"anger":0.0165,"disgust":0.0022},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the social dynamics of vaccine adoption.

Yet, inequalities in vaccine uptake across socioeconomic groups can significantly undermine their impact. Moreover, heterogeneities in vaccination coverage across socioeconomic strata are typically neglected by epidemic models and considered, if at all, only at posteriori. This limitation reduces their ability to predict and assess the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Here, we study the impact of socioeconomic inequalities in vaccination uptake on disease burden, measured as attack rate. We consider a modeling framework based on generalized contact matrices that extend traditional age-stratified approaches to incorporate socioeconomic status (SES) variables. We simulate epidemic dynamics under two scenarios. In the first, vaccination campaigns are concurrent with epidemics. In the second, instead, vaccinations are completed before the onset of infection waves. By using both synthetic and empirical generalized contact matrices, we find that inequalities in vaccine uptake can lead to non-linear effects on disease outcomes and exacerbate disease burden in disadvantaged groups of the population. We demonstrate that simpler models ignoring SES heterogeneity produce incomplete or biased predictions of attack rates. Additionally, we show how inequalities in vaccine coverage interact with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), compounding differences across subgroups. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of integrating SES dimensions, alongside age, into epidemic models to inform more equitable and effective public health interventions and vaccination strategies.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013585","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:50.659150","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Nicola Perra","raw_content_length":1712,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":1.12,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Nicola Perra Vaccinations"],"persons":["Marton Karsai","Adriana Manna"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1704,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Social inequalities","vaccine coverage","their effects","Adriana Manna","Marton Karsai","Nicola Perra Vaccinations","fundamental public health interventions","inequalities","vaccine uptake","socioeconomic groups"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Marton Karsai"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Social inequalities":2.0,"vaccine coverage":2.0,"their effects":2.0,"Adriana Manna":1.0,"Marton Karsai":1.0,"Nicola Perra Vaccinations":1.0,"fundamental public health interventions":1.0,"inequalities":1.0,"vaccine uptake":1.0,"socioeconomic groups":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725719026111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.4985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7003,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6398,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.0106,"sadness":0.0221,"fear":0.1627,"anger":0.0863,"disgust":0.0732},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a modeling framework to study the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on vaccine uptake and disease burden.

Gagné, Pietro Liò, Duccio Medini, Giuseppe Maccari Antibodies are indispensable components of the immune system, known for their specific binding to antigens. Beyond their natural immunological functions, they are fundamental in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases. The complex architecture of antibodies, particularly their variable regions responsible for antigen recognition, presents significant challenges for computational modeling. Recent advancements in deep learning have markedly improved protein structure prediction; however, accurately modeling antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interactions remains challenging due to the inherent flexibility of antibodies and the dynamic nature of binding processes. In this study, we examine the use of predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) scores as indicators of residue and side-chain flexibility to model Ab-Ag interactions through a fingerprint-based approach. We demonstrate the significance of flexibility in different antibody-specific tasks, enhancing the predictive accuracy of Ab-Ag interaction models by 4%, resulting in an AUC-ROC of 92%. In addition, we showcase state-of-the-art performance in paratope prediction. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for conformational flexibility in modeling antibody-antigen interactions and show that pLDDT can serve as a coarse proxy for these dynamic features. By optimizing antibody flexibility using pLDDT, they can be engineered to improve affinity or breadth for a specific target. This approach is particularly beneficial for addressing highly variable pathogens like HIV and SARS-CoV-2, as greater flexibility enhances tolerance to sequence variations in target antigens.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013576","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:50.659592","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Giuseppe Maccari","raw_content_length":1821,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ab-Ag","Giuseppe Maccari Antibodies","Local Distance Difference Test"],"persons":["Stéphane M.

As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present iCH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, including thermodynamic and kinetic constants, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis.

While STMDs respond robustly to target motion – even when displayed against moving backgrounds – TSDN target responses are modulated by background motion. Depending on whether the background motion is syn- or contra-directional to the target motion, the response of the TSDNs is either suppressed or facilitated (amplified). This suggests that TSDNs not only receive input from STMDs but also from neurons sensitive to background motion, but this neural circuit is not clearly understood. To explore the underlying neural mechanisms, we developed three candidate TSDN circuit models – which combine input from bio-plausible STMDs and optic flow-sensitive Lobula Plate Tangential Cells (LPTCs) in different ways – and fitted them to published electrophysiology data from hoverfly TSDNs. We then tested the best-fitting models against new electrophysiological data using different background patterns. We found that the overall best model suggests simple inhibition from LPTCs with the same preferred direction as the STMDs feeding into the TSDN. This parsimonious mechanism can explain the facilitation and suppression of TSDN responses to small targets, and may inform similar studies in other animals.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012986","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:50.661213","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"James Knight","raw_content_length":1664,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Target Selective Descending Neurons"],"persons":["Karin Nordstrom","James Knight","Anindya Ghosh","Sarah Nicholas","Thomas Nowotny"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1656,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the mechanism","facilitation","hoverfly TSDNs","Anindya Ghosh","Sarah Nicholas","Karin Nordstrom","Thomas Nowotny","James Knight","Many animals","visual motion cues"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the mechanism":2.0,"facilitation":2.0,"hoverfly TSDNs":2.0,"Anindya Ghosh":1.0,"Sarah Nicholas":1.0,"Karin Nordstrom":1.0,"Thomas Nowotny":1.0,"James Knight":1.0,"Many animals":1.0,"visual motion cues":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725778206666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9106,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0266,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0165,"anger":0.0121,"disgust":0.0236},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into the neural mechanisms of hoverflies, specifically how they track targets against background motion.

Van Nes, Ingrid A. van de Leemput Background and aim To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, successful interventions require early detection. The timing of implementation of preventive measures is crucial, but as outbreaks are hard to anticipate, control efforts often start too late. This applies to mosquito-borne diseases, for which the multifaceted nature of transmission complicates surveillance. Resilience indicators have been studied as a generic, model-free early warning method. However, the large data requirements limit their use in practice. In the present study, we compare the performance of multivariate indicators of resilience, combining the information contained in multiple data sources, to the performance of univariate ones focusing on one single time series. Additionally, by comparing various monitoring scenarios, we aim to find which data sources are the most informative as early warnings. Methods and results West Nile virus was used as a case study due to its complex transmission cycle with different hosts and vectors interacting. A synthetic dataset was generated using a compartmental model under different monitoring scenarios, including data-poor scenarios. Multivariate indicators of resilience relied on different data reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and Max Autocorrelation Factor analysis (MAF). Multivariate indicators outperformed univariate ones, especially in data-poor scenarios such as reduced resolution or observation probabilities. This finding held across the different monitoring scenarios investigated. In the explored system, species that were more involved in the transmission cycle or preferred by the mosquitoes were not more informative for early warnings. Implications Overall, these results indicate that combining multiple data sources into multivariate indicators can help overcome the challenges of data requirements for resilience indicators. The final decision should be based on whether the additional effort is worth the gain in prediction performance. Future studies should confirm these findings in real-world data and estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and lead time of multivariate resilience indicators.","source":"science_plos_computational_biology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012703","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:50.661743","language":"en","tags":["methods","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS Computational Biology","source_category":"science","word_count":316,"author":"Ingrid A. van de Leemput","raw_content_length":2293,"priority":8,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":1.58,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bosch"],"persons":["Egbert H.

This study aimed to investigate the association between the direct bilirubin-to-albumin ratio (DBAR) and 28-day mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients using data from the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. Methods This study explores DBAR’s relationship with 28-day mortality in severe cirrhosis patients. We first conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to identify independent risk factors. Then, we used Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis to assess DBAR’s link with survival time and created KM curves. DBAR’s predictive accuracy was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the relationship was examined using restricted cubic spline modeling and subgroup analyses. Result This study enrolled 509 cirrhotic patients with in-hospital and ICU mortality rates of 22.3% and 14.3%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a significant association between DBAR and 28-day mortality risk, with a hazard ratio of 1.16 (95% CI: 1.10–1.24, p < 0.001), confirming DBAR as an independent risk factor for short-term prognosis. DBAR demonstrated good predictive accuracy for 28-day mortality (AUC = 0.702, 95% CI: 0.650–0.753). Patients were divided into low-risk (DBAR < 4) and high-risk (DBAR ≥ 4) groups, with the high-risk group showing a hazard ratio of 3.05 (95% CI 1.87–4.97, p < 0.001) after multivariate adjustment. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis identified a nonlinear relationship between DBAR and 28-day prognosis (p-Nonlinear = 0.022, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed no interaction between DBAR and most subgroups. Conclusion The DBAR scoring system offers an efficient and user-friendly approach for assessing prognosis in critically ill cirrhotic patients.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334591","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.786081","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Ji Yang","raw_content_length":1917,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.345,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DBAR","MIMIC","Receiver Operating Characteristic","MIMIC-IV","Kaplan-Meier"],"persons":["LiHong Lv","XingYi Yang","GuangDong Wang","Zhang Min","Ji Yang Background"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1882,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The prognostic value","the direct bilirubin","albumin ratio","critically ill patients","cirrhosis","Insights","MIMIC","This study","28-day mortality","XingYi Yang"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The prognostic value":2.0,"the direct bilirubin":2.0,"albumin ratio":2.0,"critically ill patients":2.0,"cirrhosis":2.0,"Insights":2.0,"MIMIC":2.0,"This study":2.0,"28-day mortality":2.0,"XingYi Yang":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725808173611112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0775000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7845,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3728,"joy":0.0105,"surprise":0.0238,"sadness":0.1732,"fear":0.3941,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies a biomarker (DBAR) for predicting mortality in critically ill cirrhotic patients.

{"id":"science_plos_one_df166644f2ed","title":"Acceptability of minimal invasive tissue sampling (MITS) for stillbirths in Eastern Uganda","content":"by Martin Chebet, Kathy Burgoine, Joseph Rujumba, Noela Regina Akwi Okalany, Peter Olupot-Olupot, Thorkild Tylleskär, Andrew D. Weeks, Agnes Napyo, David Mukunya, Ingunn Marie S. Engebretsen Background In sub-Saharan Africa, stillbirth rates remain high. To design effective interventions to reduce stillbirths, accurate determination of their aetiology is important. Conventional autopsy for accurate confirmation of cause is not acceptable or feasible in several societies in sub-Saharan Africa; minimal invasive tissue sampling (MITS), is a recently developed, less invasive alternative. In this study, we explored the acceptability of MITS in the community and among healthcare workers in Uganda to guide the future implementation. Methods A qualitative study was done among community members and healthcare workers in Mbale in Eastern Uganda. We undertook in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in English or local languages. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed as necessary prior to formal content analysis. The themes were organised using NVivo software and presented according to Sekhon’s theoretical framework. Results Overall, participants preferred the idea of MITS to conventional autopsy because of the perception that it was fast, maintained the facial appearance and kept the body intact. It was thought that the procedure would improve the detection of the cause of stillbirths, which in turn would help to prevent future stillbirths. It would also resolve conflicts in the community between community members or the women and the healthcare workers about the cause of a stillbirth. It was suggested that some community members may not approve of MITS because of their religious beliefs; the fear that the body parts may be extracted and stolen for witchcraft or organ donation; and a lack of trust in the healthcare system. To implement the procedure, it was suggested that extensive community sensitization should be done, space limitations in healthcare facilities overcome, healthcare workers should be trained and limited human resource should be addressed. Conclusion The implementation of MITS in Mbale, Eastern Uganda, is likely to be acceptable given sufficient training and sensitisation.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334548","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.786697","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":325,"author":"Ingunn Marie S.

Taylor, Steven R. Beaupré Direct observations confirm that admixtures of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and microplastics (MPs) are fully oxidized during Elemental analysis (EA), with measured carbon yields, % carbon [%C], C:N ratios, stable- (δ13C) and radiocarbon (Δ14C) abundances consistent with predictions for SOM samples intentionally contaminated with plastic. As an example, MPs would comprise ~40% of all carbon atoms measured via EA in a 100 μg SOM sample (1% OC by mass) that has been contaminated with only 1 μg of polyethylene (PE = 77% C by mass). This MP contamination, amounting to just 1% of the total sample mass, would lower the sample’s Δ14C by 258‰ to −622 ‰, lower the sample’s δ13C by −3.65‰ to −25.22‰, and overestimate its conventional 14C age by ~4000 years. Moreover, this 1% MP contamination would imply a terrestrial source contribution of ~ 60% instead of the 20% for an uncontaminated SOM sample. Our results illustrate how these errors scale predictably with MP contamination level and dominant polymer types. While large errors might be recognized as outliers and scrutinized, even small levels of contamination (e.g., 0.1% by mass) can introduce significant but subtle errors that could go unnoticed (e.g., Δ¹⁴C error of −30‰). Most carbon biogeochemistry studies do not routinely recognize the presence of MPs in environmental samples, despite the ubiquity of MP in the ocean and their potential impact on measurements. Consequently, MP contamination either naturally-occurring in field samples or introduced while sampling and processing will necessarily lead to errors in organic matter characterization, source apportionment, and estimates of conventional 14C ages.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334546","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.787319","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Steven R.

Besides this canonical role, HLA-E can also present peptides from pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to T cells and can inhibit phagocytosis by engaging with LILRB1/2. To identify additional HLA-E binding surface molecules, we utilized a CRISPR/Cas9 activation screen with HLA-E tetramers, which identified Stabilin (STAB)1 and STAB2 as novel interactors. This interaction depended on the nature of the peptide/HLA-E complex, whereby high affinity peptides did not permit the interaction while low affinity peptides did. Functionally, expression of STAB1 or STAB2 on THP-1 monocytes increased phagocytic uptake of HLA-E coated microbeads.

Methods A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in Western Uganda (July-August 2023) using RAAB7. Adults aged ≥50 years who had resided in the study districts for at least six months in the past year were eligible. Participants were identified through door-to-door household visits using a two-stage cluster sampling approach. Primary outcomes include prevalence of blindness and VI and its causes. Secondary outcomes include cataract surgical coverage (CSC), effective CSC (eCSC), refractive error coverage (REC), and effective REC (eREC). Results A total of 3,125 participants were examined (54.1% female). The adjusted prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity (PVA) <3/60) was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5–1.3%). Severe, moderate, and mild VI were found in 0.9% (95% CI: 0.4–1.3%), 4.5% (95% CI: 3.3–5.8%), and 3.8% (95% CI: 3.0–4.6%), respectively. Untreated cataract was the leading cause of bilateral blindness (49.4%). The CSC and eCSC at the < 6/12 threshold were 19.7% and 7.3%, respectively. Only 19.4% of 108 operated eyes achieved good outcomes (PVA ≥ 6/12). The main barriers to cataract surgery included lack of awareness (32.8%), cost (23.9%), and perceived lack of need (20.9%). The adjusted prevalence of uncorrected refractive error as a cause of moderate VI was 1.6% (95% CI: 1.1–2.0%), and mild VI was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.2–3.5%). REC was 1.0%, while eREC was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.0–1.4%). Conclusion Blindness and vision impairment remain major public health issues in Western Uganda, primarily due to untreated cataract and uncorrected refractive error. Poor post-operative outcomes highlight the urgent need to improve surgical quality. These findings may guide targeted interventions and policy to strengthen eye care services.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334509","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.789487","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":294,"author":"Khumbo Kalua","raw_content_length":2003,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.47,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CSC","RAAB"],"persons":["Mostafa Bondok","Oscar Turya","John Onyango","Moses Kasadhakawo"],"locations":["Western Uganda"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1968,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Western Uganda","causes","Prevalence","blindness and vision impairment","Findings","a rapid assessment","avoidable blindness RAAB survey","Mostafa Bondok","Moses Kasadhakawo","John Onyango"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["blindness and vision impairment"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Western Uganda":4.0,"causes":3.0,"Prevalence":2.0,"blindness and vision impairment":2.0,"Findings":2.0,"a rapid assessment":2.0,"avoidable blindness RAAB survey":2.0,"Mostafa Bondok":1.0,"Moses Kasadhakawo":1.0,"John Onyango":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725894435,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3764,"joy":0.0152,"surprise":0.0249,"sadness":0.0555,"fear":0.5064,"anger":0.013,"disgust":0.0087},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":5,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a population-based survey with concrete data on blindness and vision impairment in Western Uganda.

{"id":"science_plos_one_c494e4b5657f","title":"Low frequency of N-methyl-D","content":"by Jakob Morén, Barbro Persson, Anna Sörman, Åke Lundkvist, Hanin Shihab, Marie Studahl, Malin Veje, Göran Günther, Gabriel Westman Background Tick-borne encephalitis is a viral infection of the central nervous system that may cause severe illness and long-term sequelae, to which underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Autoantibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) may be triggered by immunologic events, occur sporadically, and can cause autoimmune encephalitis. Following herpes simplex encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis, anti-NMDAR autoantibodies may develop and have been associated with relapse or impaired cognitive recovery. Tick-borne encephalitis has been shown to trigger anti-NMDAR encephalitis in sporadic cases, but the frequency of autoimmunization is unknown. Objectives The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of intrathecal anti-NMDAR antibody development following tick-borne encephalitis and to explore whether such antibodies could be relevant to cognitive complaints. Methods Adult patients with tick-borne encephalitis were included retrospectively from one cohort and prospectively from another. A stored post-acute cerebrospinal fluid sample was required for anti-NMDAR analysis. Two commercial kits (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) were used to detect anti-NMDAR IgG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. Results A total of 71 cerebrospinal fluid samples from 53 patients were analyzed for anti-NMDAR antibodies. Samples were obtained at a median of 91 days (range 21–471) after onset of central nervous system symptoms. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were detected in two samples from a single tick-borne encephalitis patient, corresponding to 1.9% of patients (95% CI: 0.05–10.1%). Conclusions The development of intrathecal anti-NMDAR autoantibodies following tick-borne encephalitis is a rare event, and further studies are needed to clarify their potential relevance to cognitive outcomes in a minority of cases. Testing for anti-NMDAR antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid may be considered in patients who experience clinical deterioration following an initial recovery.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334438","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.791534","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":288,"author":"Gabriel Westman","raw_content_length":2187,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.44,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Jakob Morén","sequelae"],"persons":["Gabriel Westman Background Tick-borne","Barbro Persson","Anna Sörman","Malin Veje","Hanin Shihab","Tick-borne","Åke Lundkvist","Marie Studahl"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2145,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Low frequency","N-methyl-D","Jakob Morén","Barbro Persson","Anna Sörman","Åke Lundkvist","Hanin Shihab","Marie Studahl","Malin Veje","Göran Günther"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Low frequency":2.0,"N-methyl-D":2.0,"Jakob Morén":1.0,"Barbro Persson":1.0,"Anna Sörman":1.0,"Åke Lundkvist":1.0,"Hanin Shihab":1.0,"Marie Studahl":1.0,"Malin Veje":1.0,"Göran Günther":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725953833333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.912,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8176,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2457,"joy":0.004,"surprise":0.0277,"sadness":0.1354,"fear":0.5232,"anger":0.0246,"disgust":0.0394},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the frequency of anti-NMDAR autoantibodies following tick-borne encephalitis.

{"id":"science_plos_one_f7054ec96431","title":"Structure","content":"by Bishal Budha, Gourab Basu Choudhury, Md. Shohag Hossain, Arjun Acharya FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a hematologic malignancy marked by aggressive proliferation, poor prognosis, and high relapse rates. Although FDA-approved FLT3 inhibitors exist, their clinical efficacy is often undermined by resistance and off-target effects, underscoring the critical necessity for more effective and selective agents. Here, we employed a structure-based computational approach combining pharmacophore screening via Pharmit and the MolPort compound library to identify novel FLT3 inhibitors. Pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, and docking identified two promising leads, MolPort-002-705-878 and MolPort-007-550-904, with binding affinities of –11.33 and –10.66 kcal/mol, correspondingly. These compounds were further evaluated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess binding stability, density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore electronic reactivity, and ADMET profiling to examine pharmacokinetic and toxicity parameters. MD results, including principal component analysis (PCA) and free energy landscape (FEL) mapping, supported the integrity of the FLT3–lead complexes, with MM/GBSA binding free energies (ΔG) of –39.23 kcal/mol and –27.03 kcal/mol for MolPort-002-705-878 and MolPort-007-550-904, respectively. DFT analysis indicated favorable frontier molecular orbital energies and reactivity indices, characterized by a low HOMO–LUMO energy gap and a reactive dipole moment. ADMET predictions indicated acceptable drug-likeness and low toxicity, pending further experimental confirmation. This integrated in silico pipeline highlights the therapeutic potential of these molecules as next-generation FLT3 inhibitors and offers a scalable strategy for targeted AML therapeutics.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334415","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.791963","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Arjun Acharya","raw_content_length":1910,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Arjun Acharya","FDA","AML","MolPort"],"persons":["Bishal Budha","Shohag Hossain"],"locations":["Md."],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1895,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Structure","Bishal Budha","Gourab Basu Choudhury","Md Shohag Hossain","Arjun Acharya FLT3","FMS-like tyrosine","kinase","a receptor tyrosine kinase","acute myeloid leukemia","AML"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Md Shohag Hossain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Structure":2.0,"Bishal Budha":1.0,"Gourab Basu Choudhury":1.0,"Md Shohag Hossain":1.0,"Arjun Acharya FLT3":1.0,"FMS-like tyrosine":1.0,"kinase":1.0,"a receptor tyrosine kinase":1.0,"acute myeloid leukemia":1.0,"AML":1.0}},"age_hours":4.725969041666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0335,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0067,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2726,"joy":0.0032,"surprise":0.0128,"sadness":0.0937,"fear":0.4477,"anger":0.0745,"disgust":0.0955},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes in silico research identifying potential drug candidates for AML treatment.

Although various primary studies have been conducted in different countries across the continent, there has been no comprehensive research examining healthcare waste management practices in Sub-Saharan Africa. Objective This review aimed to assess healthcare waste management practices and associated factors among healthcare workers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods and materials This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 20) guidelines. PubMed, Science-Direct, Google Scholar, Hinari, and Google databases were used to find essential literature. The extracted data were analyzed using statistical software, STATA version 14. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test and funnel plot, whereas heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Results This review include 29 studies comprising 7588 participants. The pooled estimate of good healthcare waste management practices among participants was 49.74% (95% CI: 43.73–55.76) (I2 = 96.8%, P < 0.000). Sex, knowledge, training on healthcare waste management, use of working manuals/guidelines, and working hours were factors significantly associated with healthcare waste management practices among healthcare workers., Studies done in South Africa reported the highest good healthcare waste management practices with a value of 54.34% (95% CI: 48.05, 60.63), I2 = 0.00%, P < 0.00. The pooled estimate of good healthcare waste management practices before the occurrences of COVID-19 pandemic was 50.49% (95% CI: 40.7, 60.25), (I2 = 97.9%, P < 0.000). Public health facilities also reported having lower waste management practices with a value of 46.86% (95%CI: 39.33, 54.38%), I2 = 96.8%, P < 0.000. Conclusions This review showed that only half of the healthcare workers practiced good healthcare waste management practices. Sex of the healthcare workers, training status, use of working manuals/guidelines, knowledge towards healthcare waste management, and their daily working hours were factors significantly associated with healthcare waste management practices among healthcare workers. Hence, respective healthcare authorities should develop and implement different healthcare waste management strategies, including ongoing in-service training, provision of healthcare waste management manuals, and conducting regular monitoring to enhance healthcare workers’ knowledge and practices towards healthcare waste management practices.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334290","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.793358","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":378,"author":"Leykun Berhanu","raw_content_length":2903,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hinari","Healthcare","Science-Direct","Google","Sub-Saharan Africa","the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews","Meta-Analysis"],"persons":["Gete Berihun","Chala Daba","Abebe Kassa Geto","Zebader Walle"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2806,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["healthcare workers","Healthcare waste management practices","associated factors","Sub","Gete Berihun","Zebader Walle","Belay Desye","Chala Daba","Abebe Kassa Geto","Lake Kumlachew"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Lake Kumlachew"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"healthcare workers":3.0,"Healthcare waste management practices":2.0,"associated factors":2.0,"Sub":2.0,"Gete Berihun":1.0,"Zebader Walle":1.0,"Belay Desye":1.0,"Chala Daba":1.0,"Abebe Kassa Geto":1.0,"Lake Kumlachew":1.0}},"age_hours":4.7259975333333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7405,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8519,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3299,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0145,"sadness":0.1012,"fear":0.3609,"anger":0.0759,"disgust":0.1088},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study measures the current state of healthcare waste management practices in Sub-Saharan Africa, finding that only about half of healthcare workers follow good practices.

{"id":"science_plos_one_06359fd71c19","title":"Reliability of blood inflammatory markers at constant real","content":"by Tessy Luger, Felix Uhlemann, Florestan Wagenblast, Thomas Läubli, Barbara Munz, Manfred Schmolz, Monika A. Rieger, Benjamin Steinhilber Background Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are prevalent in occupations characterised by high repetition and high force demands. Both factors not only evoke inflammatory and degenerative processes in affected musculoskeletal tissue, but also systemic responses identified by biomarkers in blood serum. Clarifying methodological aspects of biomarkers may provide insights into their predictive role in the pathway of developing WMSDs. This study will primarily assess reliability of systemic inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) and immune cell reactivity by repeated measures in workers with constant workloads over time. Methods This observational cross-sectional study will include two groups of workers: exposed group including workers exposed to higher upper-extremity physical workloads, especially affecting the elbow/forearm/hand-area; unexposed group, including office workers exposed to lower upper-extremity physical workloads. Recruited persons are screened against eligibility criteria followed by a medical anamnesis and blood analysis. Enrolled participants undergo nine repeated measurements once every two weeks, taking blood among others. Blood analyses will determine values of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and reactivity of immune cells. The absolute test-retest reliability of biomarkers and immune cell reactivity over time is assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient applying two-way mixed-effects models. The relative test-retest reliability is assessed by the standard error of measurement. Discussion Knowledge of and models currently describing the pathological role of systemic inflammatory biomarkers are based on highly-controlled laboratory rat experiments. This study has the strength of assessing a human population under real-life conditions. The major challenge is in participant recruitment given the intensive and complex study design. The results of this study could provide fundamentals for initiating a cohort study and be used for developing work-related stress-recovery concepts for occupations with different physical demands to identify workers who may be at risk for developing WMSDs.

{"id":"science_plos_one_9390180a1a51","title":"Experience of uncertainty in prostate cancer: A qualitative study","content":"by Yingna Li, David Gillanders, Anne Finucane Background Prostate cancer is characterised by significant uncertainty, yet men’s lived experience of uncertainty in this context remain underexplored. Existing research has primarily focused on uncertainty related to informational needs, the pre-treatment phase, or men under active observation. Little attention has been paid to uncertainty that extends beyond informational gaps or affects those who have undergone active treatment. Objective This study aimed to address this gap by exploring how men experience uncertainty throughout the prostate cancer journey. Gaining such insight is essential for informing more holistic and responsive care. Methods Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 men diagnosed with prostate cancer who were either undergoing or had completed active treatment. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results Four overarching themes were developed: (1) Aspects of uncertainty, including ambiguity surrounding the cancer trajectory, interpersonal relationships, and the future; (2) Initial responses to uncertainty, including emotional distress and avoidant behaviours; (3) Managing uncertainty, including strategies used to cope and adapt; and (4) Posttraumatic growth, highlighting positive changes attributed to navigating prostate cancer and its uncertainty. Conclusions Uncertainty is a pervasive and enduring aspect of the prostate cancer experience, extending beyond diagnosis into treatment and survivorship. It complicates psychological adjustment and calls for adaptive management. Support interventions should address not only informational but also emotional and relational dimensions of uncertainty, promoting openness and acceptance, perspective-taking, values-driven living, and dyadic adjustment.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334180","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.794852","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":236,"author":"Anne Finucane","raw_content_length":1868,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.18,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Anne Finucane Background Prostate"],"persons":["David Gillanders","Yingna Li"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1826,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["uncertainty","Experience","prostate cancer","A qualitative study","Yingna Li","David Gillanders","Anne Finucane Background Prostate cancer","significant uncertainty","mens lived experience","this context"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["uncertainty"],"research_academic":["A qualitative study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"uncertainty":5.0,"Experience":2.0,"prostate cancer":2.0,"A qualitative study":2.0,"Yingna Li":1.0,"David Gillanders":1.0,"Anne Finucane Background Prostate cancer":1.0,"significant uncertainty":1.0,"mens lived experience":1.0,"this context":1.0}},"age_hours":4.726025330555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.3915000000000002,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9217,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0997,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0047,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.8648,"anger":0.009,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This qualitative study explores the lived experience of men with prostate cancer, focusing on uncertainty and coping mechanisms.

Cassario, Shree Vallabha, Samantha A. Gnall, Sada Rice, Prachi Solanki, Alejandro Carrillo, Mark J. Brandt, Geoffrey A. Wetherell In this registered report, we stress-tested existing models for predicting the ideology-prejudice association, which varies in size and direction across target groups. Previous models of this relationship use perceived ideology, status, and choice in group membership of target groups to predict the ideology-prejudice association across target groups. These analyses show that models using only the perceived ideology of the target group are more accurate and parsimonious in predicting the ideology-prejudice association than models using perceived status, choice, and all three characteristics in one model. Here, we stress-tested the original models by testing the models’ predictive utility with new measures of explicit prejudice, a comparative operationalization of prejudice, the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and additional target groups. In Study 1, we directly tested the previous models using absolute measures of prejudice that closely resemble the measures used in the original study. Our results indicated that the models replicate with distinct, yet conceptually similar measures of prejudice. As in previous work, our ideology-only and ideology, status, and choice models were the best predictors of the ideology-prejudice association. In Study 2, we developed new ideology-prejudice models for a comparative operationalization of prejudice using both explicit measures and the Implicit Association Test. We tested these new models using data from the Ideology 2.0 project collected by Project Implicit. Our results indicate that this model-building strategy was not effective for relative or IAT prejudice measures. We found no significant differences in predictive ability between the models. These results indicate that the ideology-only and ideology, status, and choice models are effective in predicting the ideology-prejudice association in a variety of absolute prejudice measures, but our results suggest this may not generalize to relative or IAT measures.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334152","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.795280","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":304,"author":"Geoffrey A.

Methods A modified Delphi process was implemented in which participants were asked to rate the priority of proposed evaluation metrics over two rounds. Two Delphi surveys were electronically administered in 2019, approximately one month apart. Fifty-one health care professionals from across Canada, including rural proceduralists and quality improvement experts, were invited to participate. All quality measures in the first round were proposed by the study team. The second round included measures that did not reach consensus in the first round and measures suggested by respondents during the first round. Results Thirty individuals participated in Round 1 (59% response rate). Of the 30 respondents from Round 1, 23 participated in Round 2 (77% response rate). 115 of 177 proposed measures (65%) reached positive consensus in Round 1 or 2. Expert participants agreed that these measures should be prioritized/included when evaluating surgical and/or obstetrical quality in rural hospitals. No measure reached negative consensus in either round. Open-text comments offered practical guidance on how to interpret and use surgical and obstetrical quality data within a rural context. Many respondents believed that rare adverse outcomes have low relevance at rural hospitals where volumes are low, procedures are almost all lower complexity day cases (Cesarean section being the major exception), and patients are typically healthy. Conclusion The modified Delphi process resulted in the identification of surgical and obstetrical quality indicators that are contextually embedded in the realities of rural practice. The methodology allowed for the consideration of factors often overlooked by normative urban-based approaches, including team-based care characteristic of rural hospitals and limited access to specialist care and imaging services.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334143","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.795812","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":303,"author":"Jude Kornelsen","raw_content_length":2165,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.515,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Delphi"],"persons":["Nancy Humber","Anshu Parajulee","Kim Williams","Tom Skinner","Sean Ebert","Jude Kornelsen Objective","Abdo Souraya"],"locations":["Canada"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2130,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quality indicators","rural surgical and obstetrical care","A modified Delphi consensus study","Anshu Parajulee","Abdo Souraya","Nancy Humber","Sean Ebert","Kim Williams","Tom Skinner","Jude Kornelsen Objective"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A modified Delphi consensus study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quality indicators":2.0,"rural surgical and obstetrical care":2.0,"A modified Delphi consensus study":2.0,"Anshu Parajulee":1.0,"Abdo Souraya":1.0,"Nancy Humber":1.0,"Sean Ebert":1.0,"Kim Williams":1.0,"Tom Skinner":1.0,"Jude Kornelsen Objective":1.0}},"age_hours":4.726054653888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8817,"joy":0.0263,"surprise":0.0372,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0139,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0189},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study identifies quality indicators for surgical and obstetrical care in rural hospitals.

However, the prognostic significance of glucocorticoid signaling-related genes remains poorly understood, particularly in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Collected samples indicated KIRC patients exhibited elevated serum glucocorticoid levels compared to healthy donors (P < 0.05). Glucocorticoid signaling-related genes were curated from the MSigDB database. The TCGA-KIRC cohort was utilized for training, while 7 independent public KIRC cohorts and local samples were employed for validation. Through LASSO and random forest analyses, ACADM, ANGPTL4, and NFKB2 were identified and subsequently incorporated into a multivariate Cox regression model. This gene signature emerged as a robust prognostic indicator across multiple cohorts (pooled hazard ratio [HR] = 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.05–3.65). In local samples, KIRC tissues exhibited increased infiltration of NFKB2+ cells and decreased levels of ACADM+ and ANGPTL4+ cells (all P < 0.05). Meta-analyses and spatial transcriptomics revealed a positive association between the signature and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Furthermore, the signature was associated with T cell exhaustion levels and could predict immunotherapeutic responses in both computational simulations and real-world clinical settings (all P < 0.05). In vivo experiments showed that NFKB2 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and the expansion of CD8+PDCD1+ T cells, effects that were reversible with corticosterone treatment (all P < 0.05). Collectively, a glucocorticoid signaling-related gene signature was developed and rigorously validated as a predictive tool for prognosis and immunotherapeutic response in KIRC, offering valuable insights for guiding personalized treatment strategies.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334104","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.797091","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":257,"author":"Wanlong Tan","raw_content_length":1920,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.285,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KIRC","MSigDB","LASSO","ACADM"],"persons":["Tianhang Zhu","Wanlong Tan Glucocorticoids","Chen Chen","Yu Zhang","Wei Luo","Glucocorticoid","NFKB2","Ranran Zhou","Cox"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1884,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a glucocorticoid signaling","Yu Zhang","Chen Chen","Tianhang Zhu","Wei Luo","Ranran Zhou","Wanlong Tan Glucocorticoids","a pivotal role","tumorigenesis","cancer progression"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a glucocorticoid signaling":2.0,"Yu Zhang":1.0,"Chen Chen":1.0,"Tianhang Zhu":1.0,"Wei Luo":1.0,"Ranran Zhou":1.0,"Wanlong Tan Glucocorticoids":1.0,"a pivotal role":1.0,"tumorigenesis":1.0,"cancer progression":1.0}},"age_hours":4.726098784166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.982,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7964,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6473,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0356,"sadness":0.065,"fear":0.0777,"anger":0.0466,"disgust":0.1191},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on developing and validating a gene signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapeutic response in kidney cancer.

In this work, we propose a residual network with an attention mechanism(SA-ResNet) to perform joint monitoring of MF and OSNR for mainstream quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) signals, including 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, 64QAM, and 128QAM. After applying Taylor pruning to the model, its floating-point operations (FLOPs) were reduced from 40.5 M to 9.5 M, and its parameter memory was decreased from 2.6 M to 0.5 M. Notably, following fine-tuning, the model still achieved 100% MF recognition accuracy and an average absolute error of 0.34 dB for OSNR estimation under a sample length of 16,000 and fiber length of 160 km. When the model is evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, the average MF recognition accuracy is 99.988%, and the mean of average absolute errors for OSNR estimation is 0.32 dB.

Most of the results published in the literature are based on spectral analysis approaches, which are extremely effective in detecting and assessing EEG rhythms. However, some aspects of EEG dynamics can only be investigated using nonlinear approaches, the use of which is still relatively unexplored in the pediatric population. The aim of the present paper is to assess the EEG differentiation of wakefulness from deep sleep (quiet sleep in neonates, stage N3 in older children) and its maturation across a wide developmental window (0–17 years) using the fractal dimension. Specifically, Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) algorithm is used to analyse both wakefulness and sleep EEG recordings collected from 63 infants (aged 0-1 year) and 160 children (aged 2-17 years). To ensure methodological consistency, a data-driven criterion for the selection of HFD user parameters is implemented to enhance reproducibility. Our results show that HFD during wakefulness increases during the first year of life, followed by a stabilization or slight decrease in later years. In contrast, HFD during sleep exhibits a more stable profile, with only a mild increase over development. These findings are consistent with known neurodevelopmental processes—including synaptogenesis, pruning, and white matter maturation—and support the interpretation of HFD as a sensitive marker of large-scale integrative brain dynamics. These physiological trajectories of HFD both in wakefulness and sleep could be used as reference for future clinical applications in pediatric neurology and developmental monitoring.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0333903","published_date":"2025-10-13T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:37:51.797884","language":"en","tags":["peer-review","open-access","multidisciplinary","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":283,"author":"Maria Rubega","raw_content_length":2003,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.415,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EEG","Stefano Sartori"],"persons":["Irene Toldo","Giorgio Perilongo","Simone Ruzzante","Stefano Masiero","Maria Rubega Brain","Francesco Colussi","Claudio Ancona","Maria Federica Pelizza","Jacopo Favaro"],"locations":["Higuchi","Eleonora Lorenzon","Giovanni Sparacino"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1995,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["birth","adolescence","EEG difference","the Higuchi fractal dimension","wakefulness","sleep","Francesco Colussi","Jacopo Favaro","Claudio Ancona","Edoardo Passarotto"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"birth":3.0,"adolescence":3.0,"EEG difference":2.0,"the Higuchi fractal dimension":2.0,"wakefulness":2.0,"sleep":2.0,"Francesco Colussi":1.0,"Jacopo Favaro":1.0,"Claudio Ancona":1.0,"Edoardo Passarotto":1.0}},"age_hours":4.726129416666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6258,"joy":0.0148,"surprise":0.114,"sadness":0.0111,"fear":0.2057,"anger":0.0129,"disgust":0.0157},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on using Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) to analyze EEG data and differentiate between wakefulness and sleep in children.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_d665c1430a50","title":"A single session of mild intensity physical exercise modulates brain oscillations in healthy young adults: a pilot study.","content":"An acute session of moderate or vigorous physical exercise (PE) induces a cascade of neurophysiological processes such as release of growth factors, which relate to increased electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. Studies using animal models of Alzheimer disease (AD) showed that these mechanisms are disrupted even at asymptomatic stages of the disease. Specifically, increased neural activity within Theta band observed in healthy mice was not evidenced in mice models of AD, suggesting that EEG could be a suitable non-invasive tool to detect preclinical AD. The present study aims investigating the possible neurophysiological effects after a session of mild intensity PE, which is feasible to carry out in most population, during an EEG recording. Thus, sixteen young humans cycled at a low intensity in a stationary bike to study PE effects on the EEG frequency bands. EEG was acquired before and after PE (immediately after performing the PE, or 20-25 minutes later). Results showed that PE increased Alpha activity in frontal and central electrodes for at least 25 minutes, which aligns with previous studies in humans. Trends to increased Theta activity were observed within the left hemisphere immediately after PE, but not 25 minutes after finishing PE. Studies using larger samples should assess whether mild intensity PE increases Alpha and Theta and induces effects of different duration in both frequency bands, suggesting sensitivity of EEG to detect diverse neurophysiological effects induced by PE. Another pending issue is whether increased Alpha after PE in humans is functionally equivalent to increased Theta observed in mice.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681596v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:38:17.506414","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Cespon, J., Torres-Aleman, I.","raw_content_length":1646,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EEG","Theta"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1646,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A single session","mild intensity","physical exercise","brain oscillations","healthy young adults","An acute session","moderate or vigorous physical exercise","a cascade","neurophysiological processes","release"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["brain oscillations"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A single session":2.0,"mild intensity":2.0,"physical exercise":2.0,"brain oscillations":2.0,"healthy young adults":2.0,"An acute session":1.0,"moderate or vigorous physical exercise":1.0,"a cascade":1.0,"neurophysiological processes":1.0,"release":1.0}},"age_hours":18.726491951111107,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.088000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8176,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5257,"joy":0.0123,"surprise":0.132,"sadness":0.0709,"fear":0.1105,"anger":0.0424,"disgust":0.1063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a pilot study investigating the neurophysiological effects of mild exercise.

From an educational perspective, these advancements are both exciting and overwhelming. Educators shaping these future scientists face the ongoing challenge of staying compliant with the latest developments in molecular biology while finding effective ways to teach these discoveries. As the use of CRISPR gene editing technology continues to expand globally, there is an increasing need for a workforce that is both knowledgeable about its theoretical foundations and trained in its practical use. While advanced, technology-driven STEM courses have the potential to improve student retention, they are often lecture-heavy and lack intentional engagement strategies that support deeper learning. Moreover, agriculture is the second most impacted sector by this technology, yet there is a significant lack of teaching materials focused on CRISPR in plant biology. To address these gaps, we developed a framework for teaching gene editing that incorporates multiple engagement strategies beyond traditional lecture-based instruction. This framework was implemented over two semesters in an Introduction to Gene Editing course at Tennessee State University, offered to both undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in a degree in Agricultural Sciences. This manuscript outlines the various strategies used in the course including active learning, multimodal instructional approaches and experiential learning strategies that can be adopted in other classrooms to effectively teach gene editing. Survey-based results from the course indicate a measurable increase in student comfort with designing and executing CRISPR-Cas based experiments.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681630v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:38:17.506746","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Jain, D., Ali, F., Obunkukwu, G., Yammanuru, H., Zou, J., Obeng, J., Hughes, K.

We hypothesized from our previous work that I3 amplifies oncogenic gene expression by modulating RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) mRNA interactions. To test this, we performed miR-eCLIP of AGO2, the catalytic RISC subunit, in I3 knock-out (I3KO) as well as control B-cell acute lymphoblastic cell lines (B-ALL) and identified I3-dependent AGO2 binding sites on 111 3-UTRs. Analyzing chimeric miRNA-mRNA reads, we observed differential miRNA occupancy in the I3KO compared to control, including increased targeting by miR-181a, a regulator of leukocyte differentiation. Notably, miR-181a overexpression phenocopied I3 loss, implicating I3 in restricting miR-181a-mediated repression. Biochemical assays confirmed direct competition between I3 and AGO2-miRNA complexes for 3-UTR binding. Taken together, our results provide a model for how I3 promotes leukemogenesis by antagonizing RISC-mediated repression of oncogenic mRNAs.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681741v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:38:17.507294","language":"en","tags":["biology","life-sciences","preprints","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Kabbani, L.

The investment plan revealed Monday will focus on four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing in critical minerals, pharmaceutical precursors, and robotics; defense and aerospace; energy independence, with investments in battery storage and grid resilience; and strategic technologies, including artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. The investment is part of the bank’s Security and Resiliency Initiative, a $1.5 trillion, 10-year plan to facilitate, finance, and invest in industries critical to national security. “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products, and manufacturing—all of which are essential for our national security,” Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy. America needs more speed and investment.” This summer, JPMorgan helped put together a deal under which the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in U.S. rare earth company MP Materials. The bank is also providing financing for MP Materials’ second magnet-producing factory in the U.S. The nation’s largest bank plans to finance approximately $1 trillion over the next decade in support of clients in these industries. JPMorgan Chase is looking to increase this amount by up to $500 billion, or a 50% increase, with additional resources and capital. “America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said. “It also needs to remove obstacles that stand in the way: excessive regulations, bureaucratic delay, partisan gridlock and an education system not aligned to the skills we need.” JPMorgan says that it serves 34,000 mid-sized companies and more than 90% of the Fortune 500. It plans to hire more bankers, investment professionals and other experts to help address its investment plan. It will also create an external advisory council that includes leaders from the public and private sectors to help guide the long-term strategy. —Michelle Chapman, AP business writer","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91421183/jpmorgan-investment-national-security","published_date":"2025-10-13T17:30:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:39:53.281252","language":"en","tags":["technology","innovation","business","news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":330,"author":"Associated Press","raw_content_length":2568,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.65,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["JPMorgan Chase","JPMorgan"],"persons":["Jamie Dimon","Resiliency Initiative"],"locations":["the United States","U.S."],"monetary":["up to $10 billion","$1.5 trillion"]},"char_count":2196,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["JPMorgan","US national security","JPMorgan Chase","US companies","crucial ties","national security","The investment plan","four areas","supply chain","advanced manufacturing"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["The investment plan"],"ai_ml":["supply chain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"JPMorgan":2.0,"US national security":2.0,"JPMorgan Chase":1.0,"US companies":1.0,"crucial ties":1.0,"national security":1.0,"The investment plan":1.0,"four areas":1.0,"supply chain":1.0,"advanced manufacturing":1.0}},"age_hours":1.2290247147222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2405,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8481,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5455,"joy":0.1906,"surprise":0.0883,"sadness":0.0232,"fear":0.0992,"anger":0.0359,"disgust":0.0172},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":true},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"JPMorgan is investing in areas that could contribute to sustainability, such as battery storage and grid resilience, but the article lacks specific details on the climate impact of these investments.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_a91e51e00774","title":"‘Tron: Ares’ makes $33.5 million at box office debut, falling short of expectations","content":"“Tron: Ares” powered up the box office grid in the top spot this weekend, but Disney’s third entry in the sci-fi franchise fell short of expectations.Despite some favorable reviews — including a three-out-of-four-star one from The Associated Press — the new “Tron” film starring Jared Leto, Greta Lee and Jeff Bridges earned $33.5 million, according to Comscore estimates on Sunday. The big-budget project, reported to cost around $150 million, arrived 15 years after “Tron: Legacy” opened to $44 million before grossing more than $400 million globally.The latest chapter follows a battle between two powerful technology firms, Emcom and Dillinger, who face off against the same artificial intelligence barrier. Both can generate physical creations using laser-based 3D printers — but each creation lasts only 29 minutes before collapsing into ash.“Tron: Ares” was packed with action and nostalgia, but it wasn’t enough to draw big numbers across more than 4,000 theaters.“It’s been tough for that franchise to gain traction for it to become a big mega franchise,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. He noted that the original “Tron” movie in 1982 initially struggled at the box office, but it ultimately grew a cult following.Dergarabedian said the international numbers could play a key role toward the film’s profitability.“It still topped the box office,” he said. “It picked a solid release date. All eyes are on a big Disney film that is a huge brand, known and has been around for decades.”It wasn’t the only new release that struggled to connect.“Roofman,” which starred Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst in the blue-collar dramedy about a construction worker trying to rebuild his life, opened in second place with a modest $8 million debut.Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” came in third with $6.6 million. “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie” held steady in fourth place with $3.3 million. The Netflix and DreamWorks family release — based on the popular preschool series — continues to perform well with younger audiences in its third weekend.In fifth, “Soul on Fire” debuted with $3 million. The faith-based drama tells the true story of burn survivor and motivational speaker John O’Leary, featuring performances from Joel Courtney, William H. Macy and John Corbett.“The Conjuring: Last Rites” followed with $2.9 million, marking another steady entry in Warner Bros.’ long-running horror franchise.In seventh, “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle” brought in $2.2 million, continuing the anime franchise’s strong theatrical momentum worldwide.“The Smashing Machine,” starring Dwayne Johnson as UFC legend Mark Kerr, added $1.7 million in eighth place.Rounding out the top 10 were “The Strangers: Chapter 2” with $1.5 million and “Good Boy” with $1.3 million.After a couple big weekends last month, the box office has taken a hit in October — a month that Dergarabedian calls a bridge month between summer and holiday movie seasons. He said this month is perfect for films like “The Smashing Machine” and “After the Hunt,” which releases Oct. 17, to shine in their own way.“If you’re a movie fan, particularly in the indie, art house, award season types of film, this is a great month,” he said. “Moviegoers should embrace the eclectic offerings out there on the big screen.” Top 10 movies by domestic box office With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: “Tron: Ares” $33.5 million “Roofman,” $8 million. “One Battle After Another,” $6.6 million. “Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie,” $3.3 million. “Soul on Fire,” $3 million. “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” $2.9 million. “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – Infinity Castle,” $2.2 million. “The Smashing Machine,” $1.7 million. “The Strangers: Chapter 2,” $1.5 million. “Good Boy,” $1.3 million. —Jonathan Landrum Jr., AP Entertainment Writer","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91420895/tron-ares-makes-33-5-million-at-box-office-debut-falling-short-of-expectations","published_date":"2025-10-13T15:38:24","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:39:53.297188","language":"en","tags":["technology","business","innovation","design"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":621,"author":"Associated Press","raw_content_length":5303,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Disney’s","The Associated Press","Dillinger","Emcom","Comscore","Tron"],"persons":["Jared Leto","Greta Lee","Jeff Bridges"],"locations":[],"monetary":["more than $400 million","$33.5 million","around $150 million","$44 million"]},"char_count":3983,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Tron Ares","expectations","box office debut","the box office grid","the top spot","Disneys third entry","the sci-fi franchise","some favorable reviews","-star","The Associated Press"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Tron Ares":3.0,"expectations":3.0,"box office debut":2.0,"the box office grid":1.0,"the top spot":1.0,"Disneys third entry":1.0,"the sci-fi franchise":1.0,"some favorable reviews":1.0,"-star":1.0,"The Associated Press":1.0}},"age_hours":3.0891594227777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.214,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6428,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2719,"joy":0.1652,"surprise":0.1823,"sadness":0.3416,"fear":0.0048,"anger":0.0153,"disgust":0.0189},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":1,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is about the box office performance of a movie.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_1a3add089e55","title":"Want a more sustainable food system? Vote with your dollars","content":"Want a reason to be optimistic? The global food system is showing some green shoots that suggest more sustainable farming practices are on the way. But consumers play an integral role in making that a reality, and the choices they make every time they shop at the grocery store matter more than we may realize. That’s because farmers, companies, and consumers must all work together to create a more sustainable food system, according to Paul Rice, founder of Fair Trade USA, which certifies products to meet standards around fair pricing, safe working conditions, and sustainable farming practices. “We have the ability to vote with our dollars . . . to choose products that are climate friendly, that are sustainable, that are healthy, that are nutritious,” said Rice, speaking at the Fast Company Innovation Festival last month in New York. “And by doing that, by making that choice, we reward both the retailers and brands that are bringing us those products, but then also the growers.” That said, there’s an obligation for all of these various players to think intentionally about their interconnectedness, added Chris MacAulay, vice president of North America at Too Good To Go, which tackles food waste by connecting consumers to surplus food at restaurants and grocery stores. At the heart of the issue, MacAulay said, is that food is a “powerful connecting force” that needs to be valued. “When we value it more highly, there’s enough money to help drive this virtuous cycle flywheel that we can get to.” ‘Internalize the externalities’ Even so, change needs to happen on various fronts. One possibility might be to “internalize the externalities”—or charge consumers some incremental amount of money that goes toward sustainability, in the same way that you must pay a deposit in many states when buying beer, noted Anthony Myint, executive director of Zero Foodprint, which mobilizes businesses to contribute a percentage of their sales to support farmers. “If we want healthy soil, if we want to change farming, then we need policies and laws and programs that kind of include that little—it could be a penny, it could be a dollar—but any amount going to that change directly,” Myint said. While the challenges facing the food system are “a little depressing,” there are signs of gradual progress that offer reasons to be hopeful, Myint said. “If we can just go from doing zero to just doing anything, then it’s almost going to solve itself.” Opportunity for entrepreneurs Rice and MacAulay likewise see business reasons for optimism. There’s an opportunity to continue to build and iterate upon those sustainability efforts that have begun to grow, while there are “so many good ideas that haven’t been hatched yet,” MacAulay said. And players at all stages are experiencing “enlightened self-interest” that will fuel the sustainability movement, Rice added. While farmers are increasingly realizing that the continuation of chemical-intensive agriculture will deplete the soil for future generations, companies are realizing that supply-chain transparency is in their own interests—and supporting more sustainable practices is good for their brands, Rice noted. “Corporate America writ large is moving in this direction because it’s good for business and we have to make it so,” Rice said. “And so therein lies [our role] . . . to reward companies that are doing the right thing, keep reading the label, and stay curious about the impact of our purchasing decisions.”","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91403685/want-a-more-sustainable-food-system-vote-with-your-dollars","published_date":"2025-10-13T15:30:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T18:39:53.298447","language":"en","tags":["technology","innovation","business","news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":563,"author":"Anna-Louise Jackson","raw_content_length":4151,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":2.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fair Trade USA","the Fast Company Innovation Festival"],"persons":["Rice","Paul Rice"],"locations":["New York"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":3482,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a more sustainable food system","your dollars","consumers","a reason","The global food system","some green shoots","more sustainable farming practices","the way","an integral role","the choices"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a more sustainable food system"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a more sustainable food system":3.0,"your dollars":2.0,"consumers":2.0,"a reason":1.0,"The global food system":1.0,"some green shoots":1.0,"more sustainable farming practices":1.0,"the way":1.0,"an integral role":1.0,"the choices":1.0}},"age_hours":3.2291760536111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.0125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8025,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9465,"joy":0.0199,"surprise":0.0086,"sadness":0.0026,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":true,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":true,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses consumer choices and company actions towards sustainability in the food system, but lacks concrete, measurable outcomes.
