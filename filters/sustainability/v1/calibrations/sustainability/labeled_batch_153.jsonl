However, existing approaches often suffer from a semantic discrepancy between language interpretation and visual segmentation as a result of the lack of a structural connection between query understanding and segmentation execution. To address this issue, we propose a keyword-conditioned image segmentation model (KeySeg) as a novel architecture that explicitly encodes and integrates inferred query conditions into the segmentation process. KeySeg embeds the core concepts extracted from multimodal inputs into a dedicated [KEY] token, which is then fused with a [SEG] token through a cross-attention-based fusion module. This design enables the model to reflect query conditions explicitly and precisely in the segmentation criteria. Additionally, we introduce a keyword alignment loss that guides the [KEY] token to align closely with the semantic core of the input query, thereby enhancing the accuracy of condition interpretation. By separating the roles of condition reasoning and segmentation instruction, and making their interactions explicit, KeySeg achieves both expressive capacity and interpretative stability, even under complex language conditions.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/20/6353","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:15.386184","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Byoung Chul Ko","raw_content_length":1342,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KeySeg"],"persons":["Vol","Keyword Advancements"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1342,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sensors","Pages","Keyword","Advancements","multimodal large language models","new possibilities","reasoning-based image segmentation","visual and linguistic information","existing approaches","a semantic discrepancy"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["multimodal large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Keyword":2.0,"Advancements":1.0,"multimodal large language models":1.0,"new possibilities":1.0,"reasoning-based image segmentation":1.0,"visual and linguistic information":1.0,"existing approaches":1.0,"a semantic discrepancy":1.0}},"age_hours":18.768574260833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.4985,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7003,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8635,"joy":0.0031,"surprise":0.0098,"sadness":0.0101,"fear":0.0371,"anger":0.0319,"disgust":0.0445},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel architecture for image segmentation using multimodal large language models.

Drawing on social cognition theory and attribution theory, this study investigates how interpersonal interaction shapes customer tolerance behavior in homestay services and examines whether stay duration moderates these effects. Using survey data from 322 homestay customers collected via the Credamo platform, we test the mechanisms linking interaction quality, motivational attribution, and tolerance. Our findings reveal that interpersonal interaction significantly enhances customer tolerance behavior. Specifically, interaction encourages customers to attribute altruistic rather than self-interested motives to hosts, and these attributions mediate the effect of interaction on tolerance. Although stay duration amplifies the direct effect of interaction on tolerance, it does not significantly moderate the link between interaction and motivational attribution. These findings clarify the psychological processes driving tolerance in homestay contexts and highlight the importance of cultivating positive host–guest interactions to build service resilience.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334636","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.063912","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Ke Wu","raw_content_length":1252,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Yu Guo","Ke Wu Customer","Longfang Huang","Yajun Jiang","Huiling Zhou"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1244,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["interpersonal interaction","Customer tolerance","homestays","The influence","motivation","Attribution","Huiling Zhou","Longfang Huang","Yu Guo","Yajun Jiang"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"interpersonal interaction":3.0,"Customer tolerance":2.0,"homestays":2.0,"The influence":2.0,"motivation":2.0,"Attribution":2.0,"Huiling Zhou":1.0,"Longfang Huang":1.0,"Yu Guo":1.0,"Yajun Jiang":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781459338333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.68,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.936,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8793,"joy":0.069,"surprise":0.0101,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0033,"anger":0.0169,"disgust":0.0169},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study investigates the influence of interpersonal interaction on customer tolerance in homestays, using survey data from 322 customers.

Orozco-Castaño, Rafael Parra-Medina, Jenny Nathaly Poveda-Garavito, Jone Garai, Jovanny Zabaleta, Liliana López-Kleine, Alba Lucia Combita Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a critical component of breast cancer treatment, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify transcriptomic changes associated with NAC resistance across four breast cancer subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B/HER2-positive, Luminal B/HER2-negative, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). RNA-seq analysis was performed on paired pre- and post-NAC breast cancer samples from 32 non-responders. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed to identify hub genes. Tumor microenvironment (TME) infiltration was estimated using deconvolution algorithms. The results revealed distinct gene expression profiles between pre- and post-NAC samples, with FOS and NR4A1 being common DEGs across all subtypes. Enriched pathways varied among subtypes, including signal transduction, estrogen biosynthesis, extracellular matrix organization, dendritic cell activation, and B cell activation. TME analysis showed increased infiltration of specific immune cell populations after NAC, including CD4 memory T cells, regulatory T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, varying by subtype. These findings suggest that NAC modulates gene expression, cellular activity, and TME interactions, potentially contributing to treatment resistance. Understanding the molecular determinants of NAC resistance is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies and improving outcomes for breast cancer patients.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334335","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.071192","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Alba Lucia Combita","raw_content_length":1815,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Luminal B/HER2-negative","NAC","Luminal A","Triple-Negative Breast Cancer"],"persons":["Hedda Michelle Guevara-Nieto","Alba Lucia","Carlos A.

Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major Gram-negative periodontal pathogen, produces virulence factors such as gingipains, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and lipoproteins, which contribute to tissue destruction. Ozone ultrafine bubble water (OUFBW) has been studied for its antimicrobial effects against various bacteria and toxin protein inactivation. This present study aimed to explore the effects of OUFBW on P. gingivalis and its virulence factors. OUFBW was generated and applied to P. gingivalis to assess bactericidal activity. OUFBW effects on morphological changes in P. gingivalis and its membrane vesicles (MVs) were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Gingipain activities in OUFBW-treated P. gingivalis culture supernatant was tested using fluorogenic substrates and endogenous substrates, E-cadherin and IL-6. Degradation of OUFBW-treated gingipains was analyzed by silver staining and western blotting. Effects of OUFBW on P. gingivalis lipoproteins and LPS were evaluated using HEK-Blue cells expressing Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, respectively. Cytotoxicity of OUFBW on human gingival cells was analyzed using an MTT assay. OUFBW disrupted the inner membrane of P. gingivalis, leading to elimination of the bacterium and reduction of MVs. OUFBW also decreased gingipain activities and inhibited gingipain-induced degradation of E-cadherin and IL-6 due to gingipain breakdown. Additionally, OUFBW suppressed lipoprotein-induced TLR2 activation but had no effect on LPS-mediated TLR4 signaling. OUFBW showed low cytotoxicity in human gingival cells. Our findings indicate that OUFBW can sterilize P. gingivalis and inactivate gingipains and lipoproteins. These results suggest that OUFBW would be used to disinfect periodontal treatment instruments.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334259","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.073182","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Yutaka Terao","raw_content_length":1998,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Akiomi Ushida","LPS","OUFBW","Fumio Takizawa"],"persons":["Koichi Tabeta","Mana Endo","Hisanori Domon","Yutaka Terao Periodontitis","Satoru Hirayama"],"locations":["OUFBW"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1934,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ozone ultrafine bubble water","iPorphyromonas gingivalisi","its virulence factors","Mana Endo","Hisanori Domon","Satoru Hirayama","Fumio Takizawa","Akiomi Ushida","Koichi Tabeta","Yutaka Terao Periodontitis"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["iPorphyromonas gingivalisi"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ozone ultrafine bubble water":3.0,"iPorphyromonas gingivalisi":2.0,"its virulence factors":2.0,"Mana Endo":1.0,"Hisanori Domon":1.0,"Satoru Hirayama":1.0,"Fumio Takizawa":1.0,"Akiomi Ushida":1.0,"Koichi Tabeta":1.0,"Yutaka Terao Periodontitis":1.0}},"age_hours":4.781700961666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.44,"joy":0.0059,"surprise":0.0118,"sadness":0.0732,"fear":0.023,"anger":0.0334,"disgust":0.4128},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes research on ozone ultrafine bubble water (OUFBW) and its effects on P. gingivalis.

Their potent cytotoxic functions, encompassing the direct release of cytotoxic granules, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the expression of apoptosis-inducing ligands, make NK cells a promising therapeutic product in cancer immunotherapy. This study presents a detailed protocol for assessing NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids using a live-cell imaging system, offering a more physiologically relevant model compared to traditional 2D cultures. Utilizing this 3D spheroid model, we explored the dynamics of NK cell killing activity against two aggressive solid cancer cell lines, cholangiocarcinoma (KKU-213A) and triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), across varying effector-to-target (E:T) ratios. Our findings reveal a dose-dependent increase in NK cell activity, with higher E:T ratios yielding more pronounced tumor cell death. Real-time imaging further demonstrated distinct differences in the morphology and cell death patterns of the two cell lines, with MDA-MB-231 cells exhibiting a faster response to NK cell cytotoxicity. These findings underscore the utility of 3D spheroid models and live-cell imaging for studying NK cell function and advancing the development of NK cell-based immunotherapies.

{"id":"science_plos_one_01b726c7a3de","title":"Spatiotemporal coupling and coordinated development of rural revitalization and rural tourism in Jiangsu","content":"by Meiqin Ding, Hui Liu Rural tourism is pivotal in addressing the unidirectional urban-to-rural flow of resources, such as labor migration. However, the interaction between rural tourism and rural revitalization in developed regions remains poorly understood. This study establishes an evaluation index system for rural revitalization and rural tourism, examining their interrelationship. Using the entropy method and coupling coordination degree model, we assess the development levels and coordination degrees of these aspects in Jiangsu Province from 2012 to 2023. Furthermore, the geographical detector model is utilized to pinpoint the primary drivers influencing this coordination. The findings are: (1) Both rural revitalization and tourism exhibit significant growth, with southern Jiangsu outperforming the north; (2) The coupling coordination between these systems has strengthened, indicating a profound symbiotic relationship; (3) Spatial distribution differences are notable, with the coupling coordination degree D value in southern Jiangsu being 26.4% higher than in the north. This disparity is primarily attributable to the wider urban-rural income gap and greater fiscal investment in southern Jiangsu. Notably, the traditional “resource dependence theory” appears ineffective in Jiangsu, as the density of rural tourism resources is relatively low. Accordingly, the study proposes differentiated policy recommendations: northern Jiangsu should focus on talent attraction and the integration of culture and tourism, while southern Jiangsu should explore mechanisms to facilitate the two-way flow of urban-rural elements. This research provides a theoretical framework for coordinating “policy-market” dynamics in the rural transformation of developed regions.","source":"science_plos_one","source_type":"rss","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0334241","published_date":"2025-10-14T14:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:39:42.074000","language":"en","tags":["open-access","multidisciplinary","peer-review","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"PLOS One","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Hui Liu","raw_content_length":1786,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Hui Liu Rural","Meiqin Ding"],"locations":["Jiangsu","Jiangsu Province"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1778,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["rural revitalization","rural tourism","Spatiotemporal coupling","coordinated development","Jiangsu","Meiqin Ding","Hui Liu Rural tourism","the unidirectional urban-to-rural flow","resources","labor migration"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Spatiotemporal coupling","coordinated development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"rural revitalization":4.0,"rural tourism":4.0,"Spatiotemporal coupling":2.0,"coordinated development":2.0,"Jiangsu":2.0,"Meiqin Ding":1.0,"Hui Liu Rural tourism":1.0,"the unidirectional urban-to-rural flow":1.0,"resources":1.0,"labor migration":1.0}},"age_hours":4.78173115,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8892,"joy":0.024,"surprise":0.0402,"sadness":0.0099,"fear":0.0081,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0115},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study analyzes the coupling coordination between rural revitalization and rural tourism in Jiangsu Province.

Building on the Diabetes Epidemiological Survey, and the latest data from the China Statistical Yearbook, this study quantified Chinese people’s dietary ecological footprint per capita (EFP) and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the provincial level with different prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes. Results demonstrated that groups with a lower prevalence of diabetes showed lower dietary EFP, while the dietary EFP and GHG emissions peaked among the prediabetes group with a prevalence of 32.7%−34.9%, and then decreased significantly with the increasing prevalence of prediabetes. The increasing prevalence of diabetes was tightly linked to increased consumption of pork, poultry, seafood, eggs, and vegetables. Moreover, the over-consumption of meat, oil, and cereal, together with the under-consumption of vegetables, fruits, eggs, and milk, will further increase both the prevalence of diabetes and environmental degradation. Yet, people’s concern for their health will drive them to pursue a healthier diet, which in turn will promote environmental sustainability.

The factors that limit their spread remain unclear. To investigate this paradox, we studied the Segregation Distorter (SD) system, a selfish coadapted gene complex in Drosophila melanogaster. SD biases its transmission by killing sperm carrying a homologous chromosome bearing a target locus, Responder (Rsp), which appear as satellite repeats. Such selfish killing impairs male fertility and imposes selective pressure on the host genome to evolve resistance, either by deleting Rsp copies or acquiring unlinked suppressors. To characterize the spectrum of Rsp alleles and the frequency of segregating suppressors, we surveyed 90 strains from the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel. Rather than loss of Rsp, we found that over half of the strains (52/90) harbor suppressors located on the X chromosome or autosomes, but not the Y chromosome. The widespread presence of strong suppressors limited the resolution of our genome-wide association mapping; however, recombination analysis identified a strong X-linked suppressor to a ~300 kb interval on the chromosome. Together, our findings suggest that pervasive, multilocus suppression constrains the spread of SD in natural populations.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681989v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.642888","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Chang, C.-H., Handler, T., Fuda, N., Pascua, D., Mouton, T., Larracuente, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_f6fc4a75a478","title":"Decoding PARP1 Selectivity: Atomistic Insights for Next","content":"Selective inhibition of PARP1 has emerged as a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic index of PARP inhibitors, a class of anticancer agents that exploit defects in DNA repair pathways. While PARP inhibitors have shown remarkable clinical benefit, particularly in BRCA -mutated tumors, the lack of discrimination between PARP1 and its close homolog PARP2 often leads to hematological toxicity and limits treatment efficacy. Therefore, achieving molecular selectivity for PARP1 remains a central challenge in the rational design of safer and more potent inhibitors. Here, we perform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, energetic decomposition, and targeted in silico mutagenesis to dissect the molecular determinants underlying PARP1 versus PARP2 selectivity across four representative approved compounds. Our simulations of the catalytic domain were used to quantify residue-ligand contact frequencies, ligand-induced modulation of protein flexibility, and the free-energy landscapes governing binding and unbinding processes. Contact analysis identified key residues mediating ligand recognition, while energetic decomposition characterized the dominant stabilizing forces inducing ligand-protein interactions. Importantly, our PMF profiles revealed distinct energetic and molecular features of association pathways responsible for ligand selectivity. Our results demonstrate that selective inhibitors stabilize unique PARP1 interactions and follow favorable low-barrier association routes, whereas the same ligands encounter higher barriers in PARP2. Together, these findings provide a unified mechanistic framework for selectivity and inform the design of next-generation PARP1 inhibitors with improved efficacy and safety.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681983v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.643213","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Feito, A., DeMoya Valenzuela, N., Privat, C., Tejedor, A.

This study presents a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of P. falciparum research conducted in Africa between 2000 and 2024 as shown in Figure 1. Using the PRISMA framework, 10,903 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis was performed using Bibliometrix in R and VOSviewer to assess publication trends, authorship networks, keyword evolution, and thematic concentration. Results reveal contributions from 18,345 authors across 4,903 journals, with an average of 31.83 citations per article. Research output has grown steadily over the two-decade period, with significant input from African scholars and international collaborators. The most active research themes include epidemiology, antimalarial drug resistance, vaccine development, vector biology, and socio-economic factors in malaria control. Despite this progress, the review highlights persistent gaps in genomic surveillance, localised insecticide resistance monitoring, and integration of social determinants into malaria intervention strategies. Regional disparities in research output remain, with some high-burden areas underrepresented. Collaboration among African institutions is limited compared to international partnerships. These observations indicate the urgent need for targeted funding, strengthened intra-African collaboration, and policies that contextualise malaria research within local health systems.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_57ed8a4754c1","title":"Evaluation of plasma anti","content":"Background: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) remains a major cause of diarrheal disease in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To curb ETEC related diarrhoea, several candidate vaccines are in development, with ETVAX(R) being the most advanced. Although immunogenicity studies have primarily focused on measuring antibody titres, assessing antibody avidity offers additional valuable insight into antibody quality and immune maturity. This study assessed anti-CS3 and anti-LTB IgG avidity in Zambian children to better understand vaccine-induced antibody responses in an endemic setting. Methods: Children aged 6-23 months (n=60) received three quarter-doses of ETVAX(R) with dmLT adjuvant on days 0, 14, and 90. Plasma samples collected at baseline (V1), seven days after the second dose (V5), and seven days after the third dose (V7) were analysed by limiting antigen dilution ELISA to calculate avidity indices (AI). Naive classification was performed using titre-based thresholds (20th percentile of baseline titres) and avidity-defined naivety (AI < 0.5). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the discriminatory performance of avidity indices against titre-defined naive status. Results: Baseline avidity was detectable for both CS3 and LTB, consistent with prior natural exposure. Mean CS3 IgG avidity decreased from 0.7 at baseline to 0.6 after the third dose (p<0.001), while LTB IgG avidity showed transient decreases but no net gain. Naive classification at baseline revealed that 9/60 children had titres but low avidity (functional naivety), and 6/60 had waned titres but high avidity. Only one child was naive by both criteria for CS3, and none for LTB. ROC analysis demonstrated moderate discrimination for CS3 (AUC=0.65; optimal cut-off AI=0.36) but poor discrimination for LTB (AUC=0.30). Conclusion: In this endemic population, ETVAX(R) induced strong antibody titres but minimal changes in avidity over time with inter-individual differences, while ROC analysis highlighted the need for context-specific thresholds. These findings show the need for both antibody titre and avidity assessment in vaccine evaluations in endemic settings.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681928v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.643883","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":312,"author":"mubanga, c.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_cbc84ad7bb34","title":"Examining oculomotor behavior in central vision loss with a gaze","content":"Patients with central vision loss due to macular degeneration (MD) must rely on their peripheral vision for tasks normally performed by the fovea. Many patients develop a preferred retinal locus (PRL), an eccentric retinal location used as a substitute for the damaged fovea in tasks such as face recognition, navigation, and reading. However, the mechanisms underlying PRL development remain elusive, and no single hypothesis fully explains its characteristics. Investigations into PRL development are hindered by oculomotor assessments, which often focus on fixation ability while neglecting other eye movement characteristics and potentially conflating different behaviors over time. In previous work, we introduced a series of oculomotor metrics in cases of simulated central vision loss, demonstrating that complex profiles of eye movement behavior can be extracted from a simple visual task. Here we present longitudinal data from 10 patients with MD as evidence of the feasibility of using these metrics to characterize different profiles of eye movements following central vision loss. Consistent with findings in healthy individuals using artificial scotoma, the metrics reveal substantial individual differences in behavior, both at baseline and after visual training. Overall, patients exhibit significantly higher saccadic re-referencing than controls, despite larger inter-individual differences. These metrics provide a detailed evaluation of oculomotor behavior in patients with central vision loss and offer a valuable tool for assessing progress in training protocols.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681883v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.644179","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Maniglia, M., Maxwell, E., Vice, J., Visscher, K., Seitz, A.","raw_content_length":1585,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1585,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["central vision loss","oculomotor behavior","a gaze","tasks","PRL development","Patients","macular degeneration","their peripheral vision","the fovea","Many patients"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["PRL development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"central vision loss":3.0,"oculomotor behavior":2.0,"a gaze":2.0,"tasks":2.0,"PRL development":2.0,"Patients":1.0,"macular degeneration":1.0,"their peripheral vision":1.0,"the fovea":1.0,"Many patients":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78238710638889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6736,"joy":0.0028,"surprise":0.0161,"sadness":0.0355,"fear":0.184,"anger":0.0244,"disgust":0.0637},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on understanding oculomotor behavior in patients with central vision loss.

We present a data-driven, supervised spike sorting approach to improve the analysis of nociceptive discharges, identified through activity-dependent conduction velocity changes. Our method integrates three feature sets and applies machine learning models including one-class SVM, SVM, and XGBoost. Validation used experimentally derived ground truth data acquired by controlled electrical stimulation, allowing precise spike time-locking. Compared to Spike2 software, our approach achieved higher F1-scores and reduced false positives, indicating improved spike sorting. Although XGBoost achieved the highest median F1-scores, optimal performance was dependent on individual combinations of feature sets and models for each recording. In some recordings with many nerve fibers and a low signal-to-noise ratio, reliable sorting was not feasible. This highlights the necessity to determine sortability and optimal configures using a ground truth protocol for each recording. These findings represent an important step toward reliable analysis of nociceptive activity. The openly accessible framework supports analyzing pruritogen-induced and spontaneous activity in neuropathic pain patients, advancing tools for peripheral neural decoding.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681964v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.644781","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Troglio, A., Fiebig, A., Maxion, A., Kutafina, E., Namer, B.","raw_content_length":1518,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SVM","XGBoost","Data Analyzing"],"persons":[],"locations":["SVM"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1518,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Hybrid Knowledge-","Data","temporal spike patterns","nociceptors","microneurography","the use","a single recording electrode","variability","high similarity","spike shapes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Data"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Hybrid Knowledge-":2.0,"Data":2.0,"temporal spike patterns":1.0,"nociceptors":1.0,"microneurography":1.0,"the use":1.0,"a single recording electrode":1.0,"variability":1.0,"high similarity":1.0,"spike shapes":1.0}},"age_hours":18.7824180575,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8871,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.0285,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.025,"anger":0.0213,"disgust":0.0231},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a data-driven approach for analyzing nociceptive discharges, validated using experimentally derived ground truth data.

This difficulty stems from limited availability of task-specific neural features within individual neural signal datasets. To overcome this, we proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to enrich training features within neural signal datasets. Specifically, we synthesized artificial neural signal waveforms of the primary motor cortex (M1) from functionally related cortical regions, thereby enhancing neural datasets for improved motor kinematics decoding via DNN. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during goal-directed arm-reaching tasks, our results showed that enhancing individual datasets with GAN-synthesized M1 signals significantly improved decoding performance by about 10% (p < 0.05). Such improved performance is sustained even in the absence of real M1 signals.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_50299d871c2d","title":"Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in Parkinson's disease: Effects of age, sex, and body mass index in a large fluorodopa PET cohort","content":"BACKGROUND. In Parkinson's disease (PD), the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leads to motor symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligand [18F]fluorodopa detects reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in PD patients. Demographic factors such as sex and BMI are also associated with dopamine synthesis capacity. The combined contribution of demographic and clinical effects however remains elusive. It also remains unresolved how the dopamine synthesis capacity is correlated between striatal subregions and how the dopamine synthesis capacity and dopamine receptor function across striatal regions are associated with each other in PD patients and healthy controls. MATERIAL, AIMS, AND METHODS. For this retrospective register-based study, we used baseline [18F]fluorodopa PET data acquired at the Turku PET Centre between the years 1988-2016 with three different scanners (Ecat 931, GE Advance, HRRT). The data included scans of 350 adult human subjects, including 132 healthy controls (65 males and 67 females), and 218 PD patients (134 males and 84 females). The primary aim was to simultaneously investigate the effects of PD, age, sex and BMI on regional dopamine synthesis capacity (influx rate constant Kiref quantified with Patlak) using Bayesian linear regression. Secondary aims were to assess interregional correlations of dopamine synthesis capacity, and the association between regional presynaptic dopamine synthesis and postsynaptic dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) availability in subjects who also had a proximal [11C]raclopride PET scan. RESULTS. We found modest support for age-dependent decline in dopamine synthesis capacity, increased capacity for higher BMIs, and for higher capacity in females versus males. These effects were smaller than the effect of PD status. Dopamine synthesis capacity across regions was correlated in both patients and controls. Support for positive correlation between the synthesis capacity and the D2R was observed in caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS. PD and demographic effects are independently associated with the striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. The capacity is reduced by PD, decreased through age (particularly after the age of around 50), higher in females versus males, and weakly increased in higher BMIs. Synthesis capacity is correlated between the striatal and thalamic regions in both PD patients and controls. The dopamine synthesis capacity was positively correlated with the D2R availability in caudate. Scanner affects the estimates of dopamine synthesis capacity measured with [18F]fluorodopa PET, and it is preferrable to adjust for such variation in the data.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681966v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.645396","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":380,"author":"Malen, T., Tuisku, J., Bucci, M., Santavirta, S., Kaasinen, V., Kaasalainen, S., IsojaÌˆrvi, J., Hietala, J., Rinne, J., Nummenmaa, L.","raw_content_length":2672,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BACKGROUND","PET","AIMS","BMI","the Turku PET Centre"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2672,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Parkinsons disease","sex","Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity","Effects","age","body mass index","a large fluorodopa PET cohort","BACKGROUND","the degeneration","nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["age"],"hydrogen_energy":["age"],"renewable_energy":["age"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Parkinsons disease":3.0,"sex":3.0,"Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity":2.0,"Effects":2.0,"age":2.0,"body mass index":2.0,"a large fluorodopa PET cohort":2.0,"BACKGROUND":1.0,"the degeneration":1.0,"nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78244874583333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7071,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.0633,"sadness":0.0551,"fear":0.0408,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.1118},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the effects of PD, age, sex, and BMI on dopamine synthesis capacity using PET data.

Cluster formation was impaired, though not abolished, in neurons expressing mutated subunits together with endogenous WT subunits. Consistent with this clustering deficit, single-molecule imaging revealed altered channel dynamics, with WT channels remaining largely immobile, while mutated forms exhibited intermittent diffusion punctuated by transient immobilization events. This behavior was reproduced by diffusion-capture simulations considering channels with different number of PRC domains (i.e. with mutant subunits) and labile scaffolding interactions. Patch-clamp recordings revealed no significant difference in excitability between WT and mutant-expressing neurons. However, we observed increased firing in both conditions compared to non-transfected neurons. This suggests that Kv2.1 overexpression (for both WT and mutant channels) counterintuitively enhances neuronal excitability. Our data challenge a canonical role of this voltage-gated potassium channel in dampening neuronal firing, indicating that its overall expression level can be a critical and paradoxical driver of hyperexcitability.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681825v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.645705","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Renner, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_2adc940dceaf","title":"A Mechanistic Model for the HPA Axis Cortisol Paradox in PTSD","content":"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by intrusive memories, hyperarousal, avoidance, and cognitive and mood disturbances. A longstanding biological paradox in PTSD is the observation of low basal cortisol levels, despite the expectation of elevated cortisol under chronic stress. This low cortisol paradox challenges traditional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation models. Individuals with PTSD also exhibit normal or near-normal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels despite reduced cortisol and blunted hormonal responses to acute stress. In this paper, we provide further evidence of reduced cortisol levels using a large medical database from thousands of individuals diagnosed with PTSD. To understand this dysregulation, we apply a systems-level mathematical model of HPA axis regulation that incorporates dynamic changes in gland functional mass, the pituitary corticotrophs and adrenal cortex, over weeks to months. Using this model, we demonstrate that enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity, a known risk factor for PTSD, can lead to a steady state with low cortisol and normal ACTH, reconciling key clinical observations. The model also recapitulates the blunted cortisol and ACTH responses to acute stress and the dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test, reported in PTSD cohorts. Importantly, despite low cortisol levels, basal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity is higher than normal due to the reduced receptor affinity. Thus, individuals with PTSD effectively experience elevated cortisol signaling relative to their GR sensitivity. These findings provide a unified mechanistic explanation for HPA axis dysregulation in PTSD, grounded in the slow time scale of changes in gland functional mass and supported by literature and clinical data.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681561v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.645999","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Danan, D., Grosskopf, Y., Hayut, Y., Toledano, Y., Doenyas-Barak, K., Mayo, A., Alon, U.","raw_content_length":1867,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HPA","the HPA Axis Cortisol"],"persons":["Stress Disorder"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1867,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PTSD","A Mechanistic Model","the HPA Axis Cortisol Paradox","Post-traumatic Stress Disorder","a debilitating psychiatric condition","intrusive memories","hyperarousal","avoidance","cognitive and mood disturbances","A longstanding biological paradox"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PTSD":5.0,"A Mechanistic Model":2.0,"the HPA Axis Cortisol Paradox":2.0,"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder":1.0,"a debilitating psychiatric condition":1.0,"intrusive memories":1.0,"hyperarousal":1.0,"avoidance":1.0,"cognitive and mood disturbances":1.0,"A longstanding biological paradox":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78247906333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.25050000000000017,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9499,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0807,"joy":0.002,"surprise":0.0074,"sadness":0.0277,"fear":0.862,"anger":0.0072,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a mechanistic model for understanding cortisol dysregulation in PTSD.

These tip-grown structures are key to direct rhizobia from root hairs to developing nodules, where they are hosted to fix nitrogen. Rhizobia likely progress inside ITs by combining growth and motility, by modes not yet defined. Here, we tackled this question by combining mathematical modeling, live cell imaging, and bacterial mutant phenotyping in Medicago truncatula. Modeling the motion of fluorescently-labeled Sinorhizobium meliloti inside early root hair IT compartments estimated slow movement (2 to 6 m/h), compatible with passive rather than active motility. Consistent with this model, flagella-less fliF and fliF-fliRdel S. meliloti mutants were impaired in active swimming motility in vitro, yet could colonize host roots and nodules in planta. In contrast, mutation in the rhizobactin 1021 siderophore rhbE biosynthesis gene affected both surface motility in vitro, and host root and nodule colonisation. This mutation also promoted the formation of branched ITs in root hairs, which ultimately resulted in impaired nodule development and infection. Our findings support the model estimation and suggest that S. meliloti prioritises flagella-independent surface translocation, partially by secreting rhizobactin 1021 surfactants to reach developing nodules in M. truncatula.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681932v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.646273","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Delers, A., Bennion, A., Guillory, A., Frances, L., Krol, E., Bonnafous, F., Mendioni, L., Serrania, J., Peyraud, R., Fournier, J., de Carvalho-Niebel, F., Becker, A.","raw_content_length":1430,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Medicago"],"persons":[],"locations":["Rhizobia","Sinorhizobium"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["root colonization","Rhizobial motility preference","Medicago truncatula","Tunnel-like infection thread","IT structures","symbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria","most legume species","These tip-grown structures","direct rhizobia","root hairs"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["symbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria"],"ai_ml":["root hairs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"root colonization":3.0,"Rhizobial motility preference":2.0,"Medicago truncatula":2.0,"Tunnel-like infection thread":1.0,"IT structures":1.0,"symbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria":1.0,"most legume species":1.0,"These tip-grown structures":1.0,"direct rhizobia":1.0,"root hairs":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78249515388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.982,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7964,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9086,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0061,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.014,"anger":0.019,"disgust":0.0439},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies that rhizobia prioritize flagella-independent surface translocation, partially by secreting rhizobactin 1021 surfactants to reach developing nodules in M. truncatula.

To address this gap, we conducted a series of controlled queen monitoring experiments and surveys to understand the prevalence and viral loads of seven viruses across developmental stages of queens, drones, royal jelly, and workers from associated colonies. All viruses except SBV were detected, with BQCV, DWV-B, and LSVs showing consistently high prevalence. Eggs were frequently infected with LSVs, DWV-B, and CBPV, suggesting vertical virus transmission, and highlighting the importance of selecting healthy breeder queens. BQCV, on the other hand, dominated in queen larvae, pupae, and adult stages. Mated queens, particularly those maintained in bank colonies, exhibited higher prevalence and viral loads than virgin queens, with DWV-B and BQCV being most abundant. Worker bees from bank colonies also showed slightly higher viral loads compared to other colonies, indicating potential risks associated with queen banking. Drone samples revealed high BQCV and DWV-B prevalence, indicative of their potential role in venereal transmission. The results from hierarchical clustering and correlation analyses provided evidence that viral profiles of queens did not necessarily match those of their resident colonies, highlighting complex viral transmission dynamics. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into virus transmission dynamics during queen production and emphasize the need to improve queen health.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682001v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.646878","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Bhandari, S., Mehrparvar, S., Martinez Caranton, O., Valizadeh, B., Hardy, J., Simone-Finstrom, M., Harris, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_d5bf33e7eace","title":"Combining circulating tumor cell and circulating cell free DNA analyses enhances liquid biopsy sensitivity in detecting high grade serous tubo","content":"Background: Liquid biopsy is a promising strategy for detecting and monitoring neoplastic diseases, with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) being the most common objects of investigation. Most analyses have focused on these biomarkers separately, and simultaneous detection has not yet been attempted in high grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). The aim of our study was to assess whether the tandem CTC/ctDNA approach increases HGSOC detection efficiency of peripheral blood liquid biopsy. Methods: For CTC detection, by using healthy donor samples spiked with known cancer cell numbers, we tested gene expression assays and TP53 next-generation sequencing (NGS). The latter was also applied for ctDNA detection where analytical validity was ensured by calculating the optimal variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold for mutation calling. The clinical validity of the assays was then verified on two HGSOC cohorts and respective controls. Standard 2x2 contingency tables and Wilson method were used to evaluate clinical validity, by calculating specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: High analytical sensitivity and specificity were found for both gene expression and TP53 NGS based CTC detection, as these assays specifically detected as few as five cancer cells spiked in control sample. Regarding clinical validity, the gene expression-based CTC detection showed 0.48 accuracy, 13.3% sensitivity, and 100% specificity, whereas TP53 sequencing demonstrated better assay performance (0.77 accuracy, 46.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity). For circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis, we first identified 0.31% VAF cut-off for accurate ctDNA TP53 mutation calling. Subsequent clinical validity assessment showed solid performance efficiency of the ctDNA based liquid biopsy (0.71 accuracy, 60% sensitivity, and 100% specificity), outperforming the CTC detection methods. Importantly, the tandem ctDNA/CTC analysis improved disease detection rate in both HGSOC cohorts, allowing to achieve, respectively, 73.3% and 93.3% sensitivity. Interestingly, TP53 NGS revealed CTC private variants, and shared ctDNA/CTC mutations undetected in the primary tissue, highlighting the ability of the dual-analyte approach to capture tumor heterogeneity and allow mutation cross-validation. Conclusions: Our study reveals the complementary value of simultaneous CTC and cfDNA analysis in HGSOC, advancing the translational potential of liquid biopsy integration for the management of this disease.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681971v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.647202","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":352,"author":"Cavina, B., Corra, S., Coada, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_3fe420881bf3","title":"Discovering the unseen: a performance comparison of taxonomic classification methods under unknown DNA barcodes","content":"1. DNA barcoding and metabarcoding have emerged as cost-efficient, standardized methods for characterizing local biodiversity. Based on the sequencing of a small targeted gene fragment, it is theoretically possible to identify a wide diversity of taxa by comparing them with reference sequence databases. However, a key challenge for accurate taxonomic classification is the incompleteness of such databases, leading to most query sequences lacking species-level matches. 2. Where species-level matches are missing, it may be possible to classify query sequences to a higher taxonomic level, such as genus or family, based on the similarity of related reference taxa. The challenge then lies in confidently recognizing whether the sequence belongs to an unobserved (here, \"novel\") taxon on a given taxonomic level. 3. In this study, we evaluated the performance and utility of several methods for taxonomic classification. Methods were assessed based on the classification accuracy of both observed and novel taxa, training time, space requirements, and run time. We did this for two cases: the COI barcode for arthropods, and the ITS barcode for fungi, with the latter representing an instance with substantially greater variation within classes. To test classification of novel taxa, we used well-curated datasets with partially distinct taxonomic distribution. Novel taxa were present at multiple taxonomic levels, including genera, families, and orders. We further assessed the effect on performance when shifting from full-length barcodes to shorter sequences as generated through metabarcoding in the testing dataset. 4. This study sheds light on the strengths and limitations of different classification algorithms across varied ecological contexts and provides valuable guidance for researchers in selecting suitable algorithms for DNA barcoding and metabarcoding applications. In particular, it demonstrates the supreme performance of phylogenetic placement methods such as EPA-ng for classification of COI barcodes, and composition-based classifiers such as SINTAX, RDP, and IDTAXA for ITS.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681976v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.647518","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":300,"author":"Orsholm, J., Zito, A., Somervuo, P., Braga, M.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_77794ecf7a92","title":"System","content":"Genome-scale DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles capture organismal physiology, but most predictive models lack transparency and multi-level applicability. Here we develop an explainable framework that quantifies respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status as bounded health scores (0-1) derived from sex-specific clinical reference ranges and disease penalties, and then predicts these scores from whole-blood DNAm. Using Generation Scotland and case-control samples (n = 14,496 individuals), we screened 39 covariates for disease relevance and DNAm predictability, yielding system-relevant panels that were aggregated into scores. We compressed DNAm profiles with a protein-interaction-guided autoencoder, and trained health predictors on 128-dimensional embeddings using fully connected networks. On held-out samples, models reproduced the composite scores with strong rank agreement (Spearman {rho} = 0.87, R2 = 0.71 for respiratory health; {rho} = 0.82, R2 = 0.66 for cardiovascular; {rho} = 0.81, R2 = 0.64 for metabolic) and recover expected population structure in a generally healthy cohort, with clear separation between \"single-system low\" and \"multi-system low\" phenotypes, and graded coupling across systems without redundancy. Further, the top features retrieved from each explainable predictor aligned with system biology: airway epithelial repair, hypoxia and inflammatory trafficking for respiratory; endothelial remodeling and cardiomyocyte programs for cardiovascular; glucose-lipid metabolism and metaflammation for metabolic. These results show that DNAm embeddings can yield accurate, transparent, and system-aware health profiling from blood, providing actionable summaries while revealing the molecular processes the models use to infer multi-system status. This approach positions DNAm embeddings plus interpretable penalty targets as a practical bridge from epigenomic signal to system-level triage and is extensible for evaluation in larger, more diverse cohorts.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681975v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.647815","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":259,"author":"Martinez-Enguita, D., Hillerton, T., Akesson, J., Lerm, M., Gustafsson, M.","raw_content_length":1992,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.295,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1992,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["System","DNAm","organismal physiology","most predictive models","transparency","multi-level applicability","an explainable framework","quantifies","bounded health scores","disease penalties"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["System"],"ai_ml":["an explainable framework"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"System":2.0,"DNAm":1.0,"organismal physiology":1.0,"most predictive models":1.0,"transparency":1.0,"multi-level applicability":1.0,"an explainable framework":1.0,"quantifies":1.0,"bounded health scores":1.0,"disease penalties":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78257593083333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.41,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.518,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9397,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.016,"sadness":0.0077,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0118,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research develops a framework to predict health scores from DNA methylation, showing strong rank agreement (Spearman rho = 0.87, R2 = 0.71 for respiratory health).

{"id":"science_biorxiv_2886087dd931","title":"METAHIT enables comprehensive and flexible genome","content":"Metagenomic Hi-C (metaHi-C) augments shotgun sequencing with in-cell proximity information, enabling genome-resolved analysis of complex communities. However, computational tools for metaHi-C remain fragmented and rarely offer end-to-end, comprehensive analysis, and existing pipelines use only chimeric Hi-C pairs while ignoring non-chimeric reads, which often constitute a large fraction of Hi-C libraries. Here, we present METAHIT, an accessible and modular workflow that standardizes metaHi-C from raw reads to genome-resolved outputs. The pipeline provides alignment-derived, assumption-light quality checks, integrates three state-of-the-art Hi-C-based binners by consolidating their outputs into a single, non-redundant metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) set, and, for the first time, reuses informative intra-contig read pairs that other Hi-C workflows discard by identifying shotgun-like reads with an EM model on gap distances and using them for per-bin reassembly. METAHIT also supports Hi-Cguided scaffolding, focused visualizations for scaffold structure, MAG annotation, and mobile genetic element (MGE)-host interactions. Across six habitats spanning host-associated and environmental microbiomes, METAHIT increases the recovery of near-complete and high-quality MAGs relative to established Hi-C baselines, while per-bin reassembly lowers contamination and maintains completeness. Applied to a single sheep-gut long-read metaHi-C sample, METAHIT recovered 929 high-quality genomes, representing, to our knowledge, the highest species richness reported from a single sample, and revealed expanded diversity within Erysipelotrichales. In the human gut, METAHIT improved contiguity for an abundant Bacteroides vulgatus MAG via Hi-C-guided scaffolding, identified candidate novel Faecalibacterium lineages, and resolved MGE-host links involving F. prausnitzii and the novel Faecalibacterium MAG. Together, METAHIT delivers standardized, inspection-ready, genome-resolved outputs for comparative, hypothesis-driven microbiome studies across protocols and sequencing modalities.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681839v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.648110","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Wang, S., Qin, Z., Yu, H., Liu, R., Ge, Y., Dutta, M., Vu, L., Du, Y.","raw_content_length":2087,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MAG"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2087,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["METAHIT","comprehensive and flexible genome","metaHi-C","cell","genome-resolved analysis","complex communities","computational tools","end","existing pipelines","only chimeric Hi-C pairs"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["cell"],"ai_ml":["only chimeric Hi-C pairs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"METAHIT":3.0,"comprehensive and flexible genome":2.0,"metaHi-C":2.0,"cell":1.0,"genome-resolved analysis":1.0,"complex communities":1.0,"computational tools":1.0,"end":1.0,"existing pipelines":1.0,"only chimeric Hi-C pairs":1.0}},"age_hours":18.782593423055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.3095,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1381,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9567,"joy":0.0039,"surprise":0.0072,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0057,"anger":0.0123,"disgust":0.0113},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"METAHIT is a computational tool for analyzing metagenomic data, which can indirectly impact sustainability by improving our understanding of microbial communities and their roles in various ecosystems.

This study have explored comprehensive in-silico characterization of the PAM gene potential role in T2DM. InterPro was employed to identify protein family and it was observed it belongs to Peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase/peptidyl-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase family (IR000720), consisting of two catalytic domains and nine active regions. Clinically significant 153 genetic variants including non-synonymous SNPs within the locus were identified after analysis of dbSNP through UCSC Genome Browser. Intrinsically disrupted large region (aa 290-495) was observed during protein disorder prediction by utilizing IUPred-3. Ensembl and NCBI BLAST were used to analyse evolutionary conservation sites. This analysis resulted in high sequence similarity with common model organisms Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus with similarity 90% and 89% respectively.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_893fe0ca11cb","title":"A comparison of Dictyostelium discoideum 3'","content":"The 3'-5' RNA polymerase family consists of eukaryotic tRNAHis guanylyltransferase (Thg1) and Thg1 homologs known as Thg1-like proteins (TLPs) that exist in all three domains of life. Thg1 catalyzes an essential reaction adding a G-1 nucleotide to the 5' end of the tRNAHis, forming an identity element for tRNA aminoacylation. All TLPs studied, except Dictyostelium discoideum (Ddi) TLP2, perform in vitro Watson-Crick (WC) dependent addition of multiple nucleotides to repair truncated tRNA. DdiTLP2 has a similar activity to a Thg1 enzyme, adding G-1 to mt-tRNAHis, but shares other biochemical properties with other TLPs, including a restriction to making WC base pairs during this reaction. We identified two regions in DdiTLP2 that lacked residues that are absolutely conserved in other Thg1/TLP enzymes. DdiTLP2 variants in both regions abolish enzymatic activity of DdiTLP2, indicating these regions are important for DdiTLP2 catalysis. Complementary alterations to one of these residues (D150) in DdiThg1 caused an unexpected reversal of this enzyme's specificity, with a loss of its ability to incorporate a non-WC base paired G-1 to its physiological substrate, while gaining the ability to add WC base paired G-1 to mt-tRNAHis. These biochemical results, combined with structural models suggest a previously unknown role for D150 in controlling substrate specificity at the adenylation step by providing a checkpoint for correct setup of a WC base pair in the active site. Thg1 also appears to have adapted the role of the ancestral D150 residue for a second function, promoting non-WC nucleotide addition to its eukaryotic tRNAHis substrate.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681950v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.648678","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Johnecheck, G.

This paper introduces SwimmingIndividuals, an open-source agent-based model (ABM) framework that advances our ability to simulate complex biological processes at large ecological scales. The software's main contribution is its suite of mechanistic sub-models that govern the full life cycle of each agent, including physics-based visual predation, adaptive behaviors such as diel vertical migration, and a flexible bioenergetics engine with multiple taxa-specific equations. These detailed biological processes are made computationally tractable for large populations through a hybrid CPU/GPU architecture written in the Julia language. We demonstrate the frameworks capabilities through three targeted simulations. The model successfully reproduced complex ecological phenomena as emergent properties, including diel vertical migration, cetacean diving patterns, size-based trophic dynamics, population-level growth curves, and stock-recruitment relationships. Furthermore, long-term simulations generated realistic population dynamics and quantified the impacts of different fishery harvest control rules. By coupling high-resolution biological realism with technical scalability, SwimmingIndividuals provides a powerful and flexible tool for a wide range of ecological inquiries. It can be used to conduct in-silico experiments into the ecosystem-scale impacts of environmental disturbances, test fundamental ecological theory, and evaluate the efficacy of complex, ecosystem-based management strategies. This framework advances our ability to build a more mechanistic understanding of marine ecosystem resilience in a changing world.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681996v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.649748","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Woodstock, M., Mattern, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_4c5ae047f554","title":"Giant Clam Gardens: Cultural practices and ecological implications for population resilience in New Caledonia","content":"Giant clams (Tridacninae) are a key component of coral reef ecosystems and a major economic, subsistence, and cultural resource for Pacific Island communities. In New Caledonia where stocks are declining but giant clams retain an emblematic status, coastal communities have developed a traditional practice referred to as giant clam gardens, involving the translocation and aggregation of wild individuals onto shallow reef flats near villages. This study provides the first formal assessment of the prevalence, cultural significance, and potential ecological benefits of this practice. Surveys conducted in 11 coastal tribes documented over 40 clam aggregations primarily composed of Hippopus hippopus, which varied greatly in terms of age (1-40 years), area (1-1080 m2) and abundance (from a few individuals up to more than 2 700). Our findings suggest that the practice of giant clam gardens is now fairly widespread and primarily reflect a pragmatic approach aimed at optimizing resource access, rather than conserving the resource. Population surveys confirmed the presence of five giant clam species (H. hippopus, Tridacna maxima, T. squamosa, T. derasa and T. crocea), but failed to report significant recruitment in and around aggregations up to 1km downstream from the study area. This work revealed that while notions of protection and conservation were occasionally mentioned during interviews, they were not cited as primary motivations by communities. Nonetheless, clam gardens may contribute to broader population resilience by enhancing reproductive biomass and supporting larval dispersal across larger spatial scales. Given the declining state of natural stocks and the persistence of strong cultural ties to giant clam harvesting, this practice represents a pragmatic, culturally embedded approach that can provide valuable insights for strengthening the sustainability of this resource.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681949v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.650051","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"Dumas, P., Portes, C., Peignon, C.","raw_content_length":1905,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.375,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hippopus","Tridacninae"],"persons":[],"locations":["Pacific Island","New Caledonia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1905,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["New Caledonia","Giant Clam Gardens","Cultural practices","ecological implications","population resilience","Giant clams","Tridacninae","a key component","coral reef ecosystems","subsistence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"New Caledonia":3.0,"Giant Clam Gardens":2.0,"Cultural practices":2.0,"ecological implications":2.0,"population resilience":2.0,"Giant clams":1.0,"Tridacninae":1.0,"a key component":1.0,"coral reef ecosystems":1.0,"subsistence":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78270311416667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8221,"joy":0.0769,"surprise":0.0146,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0224,"disgust":0.0513},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study assesses the prevalence and ecological benefits of giant clam gardens, a traditional practice in New Caledonia.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_3de93994ccae","title":"Restoration of Spermatogenesis is Dependent on Activation of a SPRY4","content":"Mammalian spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) sustain male fertility through continuous self-renewal and differentiation, leading to the production of haploid spermatozoa throughout adulthood. However, SSCs are vulnerable to genotoxic drugs, and patients receiving chemotherapy face a high risk of germline instability and infertility. The molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways that choreograph SSC recovery after chemotherapeutic insult remain unknown. Previously, we identified SPRY4 as an ERK-dependent negative feedback regulator of growth factor signaling that is critical for preservation of stem cell activity in cultured mouse SSCs. Here, we demonstrate that following alkylating agent busulfan (BU)-induced injury, germline-specific Spry4 gene deletion (Spry4G-KO) reduces stem cell regeneration but promotes differentiation with rapidly enhanced nuclear ERK1/2 activity in undifferentiated (Aundiff) spermatogonia (including SSCs) in adult mice. Genes essential for stem cell maintenance, including Id1 and Cxcl12, were dysregulated by loss of Spry4. Furthermore, the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, but not mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin, was sufficient to promote spermatogonial proliferation in Spry4G-KO testis 10 days post-BU treatment. Notably, the restoration of both spermatogonia pool and fertility was delayed in adult Spry4G-KO males long-term after injury. In summary, germline-specific deletion of Spry4 results in hyper-activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in Aundiff spermatogonia, unleashing excessive spermatogenesis after germline damage, and ultimately impairing germline regeneration in adult males. Our study indicates an essential role for SPRY4-ERK signaling as a molecular checkpoint in securing SSC recovery upon chemotherapy drug-induced germline damage, revealing how stem cells normally withstand environmental stress.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681919v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.650458","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Liu, Y., Choi, T., Pearson, B., Nachman, R., Woo, W., Xu, N., Schreiner, R., Hurtado, R., Seandel, M., Rafii, S., Evans, T.","raw_content_length":1848,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SPRY4 Mammalian","SSC","Spry4G-KO","ERK","SPRY4"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1848,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Restoration","Spermatogenesis","Activation","a SPRY4","SSCs","Mammalian spermatogonial stem cells","male fertility","continuous self-renewal","differentiation","the production"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Restoration":2.0,"Spermatogenesis":2.0,"Activation":2.0,"a SPRY4":2.0,"SSCs":2.0,"Mammalian spermatogonial stem cells":1.0,"male fertility":1.0,"continuous self-renewal":1.0,"differentiation":1.0,"the production":1.0}},"age_hours":18.782717784166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2850000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.743,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3386,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0058,"sadness":0.0472,"fear":0.5516,"anger":0.0145,"disgust":0.0374},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents basic research on spermatogonial stem cells and their response to chemotherapy-induced damage.

The metabolic demands of the heart are substantial; however, the contribution of peroxisomes to cardiac development, health, and their role in heart failure (HF) remain largely unexplored. We developed and examined a mouse and an engineered human myocardium (EHM) model with a deficiency in cardiac peroxisome biogenesis to investigate the role of peroxisomes in cardiac function and pathology. In the EHM, loss of peroxisome protein import and subsequent peroxisomal metabolic impairment trigger mitochondrial damage and compromise cellular respiration and energy production. Peroxisome dysfunction results in incoherent electrical conduction, defective Ca2+-handling, and ultimately presentation of a HF phenotype with pathological force generation. These phenotypes are mirrored in an orthogonal murine model system with defective cardiac peroxisome biogenesis. Preload-dependent deficits in force generation due to insufficient energy supply are eventually fatal. Thus, peroxisomes play an important role in sustaining normal heart operations. Vice versa, peroxisome maintenance is compromised in pressure overload-induced HF, establishing peroxisomes as potential modulators of pathology and targets of therapy.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681307v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.650752","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":176,"author":"Hofhuis, J., Tiburcy, M., Hatmann, Y., Bersch, K., Wagdi, A., Guiterrez-Gutierrez, O., Solano, R., Thiele, L., Walper, M., Goebel, M., Huebner, W., Berecic, B., Casini, M., Tirilomis, P., Unger, A., Lipstein, N., Sossalla, S., Huser, T., Streckfuss-Boemeke, K., Elkenani, M., Toischer, K., Kohlhaas, M., Dudek, J., Zimmermann, W., Voigt, N., Bruegmann, T., Maack, C., Cyganek, L., Thoms, S.","raw_content_length":1333,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.88,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["EHM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1333,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["heart failure","Peroxisome protein import deficiency","mouse","human","peroxisomes","Peroxisomes","ubiquitous cellular organelles","potentially vital roles","lipid","oxygen metabolism"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["heart failure"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"heart failure":3.0,"Peroxisome protein import deficiency":2.0,"mouse":2.0,"human":2.0,"peroxisomes":2.0,"Peroxisomes":1.0,"ubiquitous cellular organelles":1.0,"potentially vital roles":1.0,"lipid":1.0,"oxygen metabolism":1.0}},"age_hours":18.78273277111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.375,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.875,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6286,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.0256,"sadness":0.1582,"fear":0.0923,"anger":0.0216,"disgust":0.0681},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on peroxisome dysfunction and its impact on heart failure.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_cb76bb3ed641","title":"Verapamil limits inflammation by restoring VGCC","content":"Rationale: In cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, excessive neutrophilic inflammation drives lung damage and premature mortality. Current anti-inflammatory therapies have limited efficacy, partly due to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying CF-associated inflammation. Increased epithelial calcium signaling has been implicated, but how CFTR dysfunction perturbs the CFTR/calcium axis to promote inflammation remains unclear. Objectives: Using Cftr-depleted zebrafish and human approaches, we sought to i) define how CFTR dysfunction alters epithelial calcium signaling and promotes inflammation, and ii) assess whether calcium channel antagonists can attenuate inflammatory damage in CF. Methods and Results: We generated a transgenic zebrafish line expressing the calcium reporter GCaMP6 under an epithelial promoter to dynamically map epithelial calcium activity in vivo. Cftr-depleted zebrafish exhibited exaggerated epithelial calcium elevations following injury compared with wild-type animals. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) normalized epithelial calcium responses and reduced both oxidative stress and neutrophil recruitment. Among FDA-approved VGCCs antagonists tested, only verapamil promoted resolution of neutrophilic inflammation and improved tissue repair in CF zebrafish. Mechanistically, verapamil reduced aberrant epithelial calcium fluxes, ROS generation and NF-{kappa}B activation. These effects were confirmed in the human CF epithelial cell CFBE41o-, where verapamil reduced calcium and oxidative stress. Conclusions/ These findings establish dysregulated calcium signaling via L-type VGCCs as a pathogenic driver of inflammation in CF and identify verapamil as a promising therapeutic candidate. By restoring calcium and oxidative homeostasis, verapamil alleviates inflammatory damage, supporting its repurposing as a candidate anti-inflammatory therapy in CF.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681885v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.651047","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"CORNELIE, S., SUIRE, B., Huc-Brandt, S., YATIME, L., Dupont, C., Renshaw, S., Lutfalla, G., Floto, R.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_cfe3704b5b90","title":"Beadex modulates hematopoiesis and innate immune defense against microbial infection in Drosophila melanogaster","content":"Transcription factors play a crucial role during hematopoiesis with implications in leukemia. LIM-domain only proteins (LMO) are also found to be associated with chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and are highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, where they correlate with poor prognosis. However, their role in myeloid cell lineage specification and function is poorly understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster, which possesses a single LMO homolog, Beadex (dLMO), and a conserved myeloid-like immune system, we have shown its conserved role in plasmatocytes (equivalent to macrophages) development and innate immunity. Beadex is expressed in progenitor and differentiated plasmatocytes, and its loss reduced lymph gland size, mature plasmatocyte numbers and phagocytic efficiency. The phagocytes of Beadex mutant flies feature reduced filopodia length and lamellipodium area. Mechanistically, Beadex regulates actin remodelling by regulating the expression level of profilin (chickadee/chic), as chic overexpression rescued the defect in phagocytosis. Overexpression of Beadex in hemocytes increased fly susceptibility towards Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection and this mortality was due to an infection-induced pathology independent of bacterial burden. Bulk RNA sequencing of Beadex knockdown hemocytes revealed transcriptional changes in actin cytoskeleton regulatory genes, phagosome function and immune response pathways. In conclusion, our study identifies Beadex as a key transcriptional regulator impacting multiple aspects of myeloid cell function, ranging from hematopoiesis and cytoskeletal dynamics to host-level immune defense.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681973v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:10.651330","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","cutting-edge","preprints","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Nongthomba, U., Jain, S., Salian, K., Shah, V.","raw_content_length":1690,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Drosophila","LMO"],"persons":["Beadex"],"locations":["myeloid"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1690,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Beadex","Drosophila melanogaster","immune defense","microbial infection","Transcription factors","a crucial role","hematopoiesis","implications","leukemia","LIM-domain only proteins"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LIM-domain only proteins"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Beadex":3.0,"Drosophila melanogaster":3.0,"immune defense":2.0,"microbial infection":2.0,"Transcription factors":1.0,"a crucial role":1.0,"hematopoiesis":1.0,"implications":1.0,"leukemia":1.0,"LIM-domain only proteins":1.0}},"age_hours":18.782762961388887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8291,"joy":0.0029,"surprise":0.0096,"sadness":0.0597,"fear":0.029,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0565},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies Beadex as a key transcriptional regulator impacting myeloid cell function.

{"id":"ai_engadget_d2ed6366e684","title":"SteelSeries' updated Nova 7 gaming headset offers much better battery life","content":"SteelSeries just released a refresh of its popular Arctis Nova 7 midrange gaming headset. The Nova 7 Gen 2 offers significantly improved battery life, with an increase of around 40 percent when compared to the original version. This translates to 54 hours of use per charge, which is a mighty fine metric. There's quick-charging that can provide six more hours of use in 15 minutes at the outlet. It charges via USB-C and can simultaneously play audio from both a 2.4GHz wireless connection and Bluetooth audio. This means that users can mix and match audio sources, which comes in handy when gaming. The headset connects wirelessly to all major gaming consoles, in addition to PCs and phones. The Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 integrates with the company's mobile app. This offers more than 200 presets for specific games, all of which adjust the EQ to match what's being played. On PC, the presets will automatically adjust depending on the game. These are headphones intended for gaming, so they also include a noise-cancelling microphone. This little boom mic can be hidden within the headset and disabled when using a standalone microphone. As for aesthetics, the Nova 7 looks a lot like the company's high-end headsets. It's available in three colors, including black, white and magenta. The headset is available to purchase right now and costs $200. It does lack a few features included with its higher-priced cousins, like the swappable battery system and active noise cancellation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/steelseries-updated-nova-7-gaming-headset-offers-much-better-battery-life-171435527.html?src=rss","source":"ai_engadget","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/steelseries-updated-nova-7-gaming-headset-offers-much-better-battery-life-171435527.html?src=rss","published_date":"2025-10-14T17:14:45","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:40:33.817741","language":"en","tags":["gadgets","siteengadget","audio_technology","languageen-us","consumer","technology","headline","regionus"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics","source_category":"ai","word_count":252,"author":"Lawrence Bonk","raw_content_length":2729,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Nova 7 Gen 2","Nova","SteelSeries"],"persons":["Arctis Nova 7"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1666,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SteelSeries","much better battery life","use","a refresh","The Nova 7 Gen","significantly improved battery life","an increase","around 40 percent","the original version","54 hours"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SteelSeries":3.0,"much better battery life":2.0,"use":2.0,"a refresh":1.0,"The Nova 7 Gen":1.0,"significantly improved battery life":1.0,"an increase":1.0,"around 40 percent":1.0,"the original version":1.0,"54 hours":1.0}},"age_hours":1.5380528022222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.511000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9022,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8981,"joy":0.0311,"surprise":0.0552,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0008,"anger":0.0066,"disgust":0.0043},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":true,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed product (gaming headset) with a measurable improvement in battery life (40% increase).

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_22eeee1b9749","title":"GM takes a $1.6 billion hit as EV tax credit ends and it rethinks its strategy","content":"General Motors said on Tuesday it would take a $1.6 billion charge in the third quarter as it reshapes its electric vehicle strategy following the scrapping of a key federal incentive, a move likely to dampen demand. U.S. carmakers have delayed or canceled new EV models and battery plants and pared other investments, citing weaker-than-expected demand. The market faces further strain after the Trump administration removed a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, a key support for the industry. EV adoption rate to slow “Following recent U.S. Government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow,” GM said in a filing on Tuesday. Shares of the Detroit, Michigan-based automaker were down 2.5% in premarket trading. The stock has been up about 4.5% this year. Some auto industry executives, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, have warned that EV sales will drop significantly in the absence of the tax credit. However, some, including the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, have said that the EV market remains resilient. Both GM and crosstown rival Ford had launched a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired, before walking back on those plans. The changes will not affect GM’s current portfolio of its Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac EVs that are in production. The Detroit automaker warned of the possibility of further charges as a result of the reassessment of its capacity and manufacturing footprint, which it said was still ongoing. The charges comprise a $1.2 billion non-cash impairment related to EV capacity adjustments and $400 million for contract-cancellation fees and commercial settlements. The charges will be recorded as adjustments to the automaker’s non-GAAP results for the third quarter scheduled for early next week. —Utkarsh Shetti, Reuters","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91421753/gm-charge-ev-tax-credit-ends","published_date":"2025-10-14T17:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:41:47.432261","language":"en","tags":["tech","business","innovation","technology"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":317,"author":"Reuters","raw_content_length":2504,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.585,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["U.S. Government","General Motors"],"persons":["Trump"],"locations":["U.S.","Michigan","Detroit"],"monetary":["$1.6 billion","7,500"]},"char_count":1992,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a 16 billion hit","its strategy","General Motors","Tuesday","a 16 billion charge","the third quarter","its electric vehicle strategy","the scrapping","a key federal incentive","a move"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a 16 billion hit":2.0,"its strategy":2.0,"General Motors":1.0,"Tuesday":1.0,"a 16 billion charge":1.0,"the third quarter":1.0,"its electric vehicle strategy":1.0,"the scrapping":1.0,"a key federal incentive":1.0,"a move":1.0}},"age_hours":1.785667173888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0845,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0097,"sadness":0.6237,"fear":0.0817,"anger":0.1466,"disgust":0.0504},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":5,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"GM is scaling back its EV strategy due to the removal of tax credits, which will likely slow EV adoption.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_9b5859259259","title":"Trump calls it a ‘joke.’ JP Morgan says it’s crucial for making AI work","content":"Wind and solar power have been under attack during Donald Trump’s second term as president. He has called renewable energy a “joke,” canceled wind and solar projects, and taken actions to prop up coal and other fossil fuels as a way to “secure” the country’s “energy independence.” But the U.S. will struggle to have enough energy without wind and solar—especially as the tech sector’s growing use of AI demands more power—according to Chuka Umunna, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s global head of sustainable solutions, who spoke with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. The comments came as JPMorgan announced an initiative to invest $1.5 trillion toward “security and resilience” that includes investments for solar, battery storage, nuclear, and efforts to modernize the energy grid. The Trump administration has expressed support for expanding geothermal as well as nuclear energy. But Umunna said those won’t be enough to help the country meet its energy demands, and succeed when it comes to AI—we will still need wind and solar as well. “It’s difficult to conceive of a situation in which they won’t need to tap into those sources of energy,” he said. “We need more energy from all sources.” Nuclear in particular takes “years to come on stream,” Umunna noted. Projects take an average of seven years, though the U.S. Government Accountability Office says nuclear power plants take 10 to 12 years to plan, license, and build. It can also take up to seven years to build new gas-fired turbines. Wind and solar, in contrast, are among the fastest (and cheapest) new sources of energy to build, with many projects taking just 12 to 18 months. Trump has also pushed his fossil fuel energy agenda as a way for the country to solve its “energy emergency” and achieve “energy independence.” But according to Umunna, renewables will actually help the country be more self-sufficient. The debate about sustainability, and whether or not to deploy renewable energy, is no longer a binary, he said: “It involves complex issues of geopolitics and [economic] competitiveness as well.” When it comes to green economy stocks, which have seen strong recent gains, investors see an advantage not only from the sustainability angle, but also around “sovereignty, the strategic autonomy thematic,” he added. JPMorgan has identified 150 stocks that benefit from both. JPMorgan’s Security and Resiliency Initiative is a 10-year plan to finance industries it says are crucial to economic security. It will invest in four main buckets: supply chain and advanced manufacturing; defense and aerospace; energy independence and resilience; and “frontier and strategic technologies” (including AI and quantum computing).","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91421864/trump-calls-it-a-joke-jp-morgan-says-its-crucial-for-making-ai-work","published_date":"2025-10-14T16:45:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T18:41:47.433803","language":"en","tags":["business","news","technology","innovation"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":427,"author":"Kristin Toussaint","raw_content_length":4416,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":2.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["JP Morgan","JPMorgan Chase & Co’s","JPMorgan","Bloomberg Television"],"persons":["Chuka Umunna","Trump","Umunna","Donald Trump’s"],"locations":["U.S."],"monetary":["$1.5 trillion"]},"char_count":2686,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a joke","Trump","JP Morgan","wind","Wind","solar power","attack","Donald Trumps second term","president","renewable energy"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["wind","Wind","solar power","renewable energy"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a joke":3.0,"Trump":2.0,"JP Morgan":2.0,"wind":2.0,"Wind":1.0,"solar power":1.0,"attack":1.0,"Donald Trumps second term":1.0,"president":1.0,"renewable energy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.035684843611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.2695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2539,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3261,"joy":0.0022,"surprise":0.0077,"sadness":0.0346,"fear":0.3845,"anger":0.1126,"disgust":0.1323},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":7,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":true,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"JP Morgan is investing $1.5 trillion in \"security and resilience\" including solar, battery storage, and nuclear, which represents a concrete action.
