We describe abstract frameworks for linear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening plasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent formulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in particular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable examples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the examples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to find the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models within the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although some examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it may appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to explain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of additivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint qualification. In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be well-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications can help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening, ensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a function-valued strain rate.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13068","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.107863","language":"en","tags":["mathap","mathds","preprints","mathmp","mathematics","mathoc","research","mathfa","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Ivan Gudoshnikov","raw_content_length":1533,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1530,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["elastoplasticity","Regularity","the fundamental limitations","constraint qualifications","the problems","terms","arXiv241213068v2 Announce Type","Abstract","the existence","existence"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["constraint qualifications"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"elastoplasticity":3.0,"Regularity":2.0,"the fundamental limitations":2.0,"constraint qualifications":2.0,"the problems":2.0,"terms":2.0,"arXiv241213068v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the existence":1.0,"existence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.761637454722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8241,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0274,"sadness":0.0107,"fear":0.0615,"anger":0.0398,"disgust":0.0273},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the mathematical limitations of elastoplasticity models, specifically the loss of strain regularity.

However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08242","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.118937","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","research","mathpr","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":178,"author":"Fabio Frommer","raw_content_length":1137,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ambartzumian","Kirkwood"],"persons":["Kuna","n\\geq","Speer","Lebowitz"],"locations":["Kirkwood"],"monetary":["$\\rho $"]},"char_count":1136,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Kirkwood closure point process","A solution","the Kirkwood","arXiv250608242v3 Announce Type","Abstract","The Kirkwood superposition","a well-known tool","statistical physics","the n-point correlation functions","ngeq"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Kirkwood closure point process":2.0,"A solution":2.0,"the Kirkwood":2.0,"arXiv250608242v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The Kirkwood superposition":1.0,"a well-known tool":1.0,"statistical physics":1.0,"the n-point correlation functions":1.0,"ngeq":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7620423980555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8406,"joy":0.0304,"surprise":0.1111,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0042,"anger":0.0065,"disgust":0.0021},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on the Kirkwood closure process, a mathematical tool used in statistical physics.

This TV-regularised convex program on the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy observation from a measurement operator. While previous works have uncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in order to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local positive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In practice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved. In this paper, we prove that the ``sinc-4'' kernel, used for signal recovery and mixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we introduce the kernel switch analysis, which allows to leverage on a known LPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds. Together, these results provide easy-to-check conditions to get error bounds for a large family of translation-invariant model kernels. Besides, we also show that known BLASSO guarantees can be made adaptive to the noise level. This improves on known results where this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel. We illustrate the interest of our results in the case of mixture model estimation, using band-limiting smoothing and sketching techniques to reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08444","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.120526","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","mathematics","statml","research","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Yohann De Castro, R\\'emi Gribonval, Nicolas Jouvin","raw_content_length":1458,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BLASSO","the Beurling-LASSO","LPC","LPC-kernels"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1457,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["continuous sparse regularisation","Effective regions","kernels","application","sketched mixtures","measures","arXiv250708444v3","Announce Type","Abstract","This paper"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"continuous sparse regularisation":3.0,"Effective regions":2.0,"kernels":2.0,"application":2.0,"sketched mixtures":2.0,"measures":2.0,"arXiv250708444v3":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7620997111111114,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.893,"joy":0.0243,"surprise":0.0379,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0184,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on advancing the theory of continuous sparse regularisation, which could potentially improve signal recovery and mixture problems.

These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov.

Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on the bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces of large cardinality.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25489","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.127998","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathematics","mathco","mathmg","research","mathpr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Dylan J.

Vessel characteristics (including battery capacity), fleet size, cyclic schedule frequencies, sailing leg speeds, and shore charging infrastructure are jointly optimized. The problem is nonlinear and nonconvex in its original form, which makes it intractable for most real-world instances. The conventional approach in the literature is to solve a linear approximation by restricting vessel designs and sailing leg speeds to a small finite set. Contrary to the conventional linearization approach, this paper deals with the nonlinearities directly. We show that the problem exhibits a hidden convex structure uncovered by nonlinear changes of variables. By exploiting the favorable convex form of the transformed problem, we solve it in a few seconds using a free off-the-shelf solver that requires no initial guesses, variable bounds, or parameter tuning. We then easily recover the exact solution to the original nonconvex problem by reversing the variable changes. We provide an open-source implementation of our method.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04313","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.130256","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathoc","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Antti Ritari, Jani Romanoff, Kari Tammi","raw_content_length":1250,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Convex Formulation"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1249,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Convex Formulation","which","Announce Type","Abstract","This paper","cost-effective planning","battery-electric vessel services","predetermined routes","Vessel characteristics","battery capacity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Convex Formulation":2.0,"which":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"cost-effective planning":1.0,"battery-electric vessel services":1.0,"predetermined routes":1.0,"Vessel characteristics":1.0,"battery capacity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.762412536111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9266,"joy":0.0161,"surprise":0.0231,"sadness":0.0104,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0135,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The paper presents a novel convex formulation for optimizing zero-emission vessel routes, which could significantly reduce computational time.

We consider the variable carrying capacity model (VCM), which can generate such complex multi-peak dynamics, but is also demonstrated to show finite-time blow-up behavior via a sign switching structural instability. We build an adaptive behavioral model with a density-dependent switch to stabilize growth, effectively eliminating blow-up, and also capable of generating multiple peaks. Furthermore, guided by empirical work on environment drivers for pests, we devise a non-autonomous model with time-dependent host plant fitness, successfully connecting transient population dynamics with abiotic drivers such as flooding. Finally, we discuss the practical significance of the results through the Economic Threshold (ET) and Economic Injury Level (EIL) calculation for all models. Our simulations all clearly show that aphid abundances exceed these threshold levels, and control is required.

Our construction can also be regarded as a continuous-time quantum analog of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To prepare the quantum Gibbs state, our algorithm invokes Hamiltonian simulation for a time proportional to the mixing time and the inverse temperature $\\beta$, up to polylogarithmic factors. Moreover, the gate complexity reduces significantly for lattice Hamiltonians as the corresponding Lindblad operators are (quasi-) local (with radius $\\sim\\beta$) and only depend on local Hamiltonian patches. Meanwhile, purifying our Lindbladians yields a temperature-dependent family of frustration-free \"parent Hamiltonians\", prescribing an adiabatic path for the canonical purified Gibbs state (i.e., the Thermal Field Double state).

This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.137372","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","math-ph","nlinao","research","cond-matstat-mech","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Karl J Friston, Maxwell J D Ramstead, Dalton A R Sakthivadivel","raw_content_length":1598,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FEP"],"persons":["Lyapunov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1597,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A framework","the use","generative modelling","non","replace-cross Abstract","an approach","mathematically modelling systems","objects","generative models","the dependence relationships"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A framework":2.0,"the use":2.0,"generative modelling":2.0,"non":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"an approach":1.0,"mathematically modelling systems":1.0,"objects":1.0,"generative models":1.0,"the dependence relationships":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7626749852777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8213,"joy":0.0785,"surprise":0.0668,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0093,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0047},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for modeling complex systems, including those relevant to sustainability.

However, experimental observations are necessary to calibrate certain simulator parameters for the prediction. In this work, we use a multi-output simulator to predict all its outputs, including those that have never been experimentally observed. This situation is referred to as the transposition context. To accurately quantify the discrepancy between model outputs and real data in this context, conventional methods cannot be applied, and the Bayesian calibration must be augmented by incorporating a joint model error across all outputs. To achieve this, the proposed method is to consider additional numerical input parameters within a hierarchical Bayesian model, which includes hyperparameters for the prior distribution of the calibration variables. This approach is applied on a computer code with three outputs that models the Taylor cylinder impact test with a small number of observations. The outputs are considered as the observed variables one at a time, to work with three different transposition situations. The proposed method is compared with other approaches that embed model errors to demonstrate the significance of the hierarchical formulation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00116","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.137795","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","mathematics","research","statme","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Charlie Sire, Josselin Garnier, C\\'edric Durantin, Baptiste Kerleguer, Gilles Defaux, Guillaume Perrin","raw_content_length":1384,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bayesian Calibration for Prediction"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1383,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bayesian Calibration","Prediction","a Multi","replace-cross Abstract","Numerical simulations","the behavior","physical systems","Bayesian approaches","this purpose","experimental observations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bayesian Calibration":2.0,"Prediction":2.0,"a Multi":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Numerical simulations":1.0,"the behavior":1.0,"physical systems":1.0,"Bayesian approaches":1.0,"this purpose":1.0,"experimental observations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7626891275,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.7065,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5413,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9135,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0266,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.0152,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a Bayesian calibration method for numerical simulations, specifically applied to a Taylor cylinder impact test.

Specifically, given a distribution function $F$ and a parametric family $\\mathcal{G}=\\{ G(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) : \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\Theta\\}$, we consider the testing problem \\[ H_0: \\| F - G(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_F) \\|_p \\geq \\epsilon \\quad \\text{vs} \\quad H_1: \\| F - G(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_F) \\|_p < \\epsilon, \\] where $\\epsilon>0$ is a margin of error and $G(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_F)$ denotes a representative of $F$ within the parametric class. The approximate model is determined via an M-estimator of the parameters. %The objective is the approximate validation of a distribution or an entire parametric family up to a pre-specified threshold value. The methodology also quantifies the percentage improvement of the proposed model relative to a non-informative (constant) benchmark.

Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied by Sasada and Uozumi (2024). Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21359","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.140762","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathqa","mathematics","nlinsi","research","mathpr","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Hiroki Kondo, Sachiko Nakajima, Makiko Sasada","raw_content_length":1402,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Sasada","Ultra arXiv:2504.21359v3 Announce Type","Uozumi"],"persons":["Yang-Baxter"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1401,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ultra","Yang-Baxter maps","replace-cross Abstract","the relationship","the independence preserving IP property","their role","integrable systems","the perspective","discretization","the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ultra":2.0,"Yang-Baxter maps":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the relationship":1.0,"the independence preserving IP property":1.0,"their role":1.0,"integrable systems":1.0,"the perspective":1.0,"discretization":1.0,"the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7627872944444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8518,"joy":0.0195,"surprise":0.0317,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.0292,"anger":0.046,"disgust":0.0154},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on ultra-discretization and its impact on integrable systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_705ee9fba00c","title":"Geometric optimization for quantum communication","content":"arXiv:2509.15106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Determining the ultimate limits of quantum communication, such as the quantum capacity of a channel and the distillable entanglement of a shared state, remains a central challenge in quantum information theory, primarily due to the phenomenon of superadditivity. This work develops Riemannian optimization methods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on these fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically searches for state and channel extensions that minimize known information-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of all possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that overcomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined continuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new state-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the previously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian optimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish lower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum instruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by parameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical results for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our methods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results. Together, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and powerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication limits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel coherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity lower bounds in general.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15106","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.143579","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","mathoc","research","quant-ph","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":263,"author":"Chengkai Zhu, Hongyu Mao, Kun Fang, Xin Wang","raw_content_length":1976,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.315,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Stiefel"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1975,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["quantum communication","Geometric optimization","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","the ultimate limits","the quantum capacity","a channel","the distillable entanglement","a shared state","a central challenge"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"quantum communication":3.0,"Geometric optimization":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the ultimate limits":1.0,"the quantum capacity":1.0,"a channel":1.0,"the distillable entanglement":1.0,"a shared state":1.0,"a central challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7628842133333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.9225,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7845,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8337,"joy":0.0239,"surprise":0.0803,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.0196,"anger":0.0231,"disgust":0.01},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel method for optimizing quantum communication, which could potentially improve the efficiency of data transfer and reduce energy consumption in the long run.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6dbe58d105c7","title":"A Machine Learning Approach Reveals CRISPR","content":"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli is a critical global health challenge, particularly in urinary tract infections, where first-line treatments are increasingly compromised. While horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via mobile genetic elements is a major driver of AMR, the genomic factors that may constrain resistance gene acquisition remain underexplored. CRISPR-Cas systems, which provide adaptive immunity against foreign DNA, could influence AMR dynamics, but their role in E. coli remains incompletely understood. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive whole-genome analysis of uropathogenic E. coli isolates, including a newly sequenced collection from Australian clinical samples and an independent, globally sourced validation cohort. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were integrated with CRISPR-Cas subtype classification, resistance gene burden, and mobile element content. Elastic net regression, adaptive lasso, and tree-based machine learning models were used to identify genomic predictors of resistance, with performance validated across both datasets. Results: CRISPR-Cas subtype I-F was consistently associated with susceptibility to antibiotics commonly acquired through HGT, including trimethoprim and ampicillin, and linked to lower ARG and MGE burden. In contrast, Type I-E arrays, especially when co-occurring with orphan I-F arrays, were associated with increased resistance. These associations remained robust after adjusting for phylogroup, plasmid content, and genomic background, and were validated across datasets. Conclusions: Subtype-specific CRISPR-Cas systems shape antibiotic resistance profiles in E. coli, with Type I-F functioning as a potential genomic barrier to ARG acquisition. These findings highlight CRISPR array typing as a novel biomarker for AMR risk prediction and surveillance, and suggest new opportunities for leveraging CRISPR-based mechanisms to limit resistance propagation in clinical contexts.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681552v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.732818","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Young, A.

FA also prevents other developmental malformations, including several alcohol-induced malformations in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) models. Here, we show that FA acts through a direct metabolic link with retinoic acid (RA) synthesis. Using a pax3 knockdown Xenopus model of FA-rescueable NTDs, we show that RA or its precursors equally rescue these defects. Similarly, FA rescues alcohol-induced NTDs in a model previously shown to be rescued by RA. We identify the FA-metabolizing enzyme, formyl tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, encoded by the aldh1l1 gene, as essential for this rescue: FA upregulates aldh1l1 expression and RA biosynthesis, and loss of aldh1l1 abolishes the FA protective effect. Remarkably, human ALDH1L1 converts retinaldehyde to RA, and its overexpression restores neural tube closure in aldh1l1 knockdown embryos when retinaldehyde is provided. ALDH1L1 enables FA to restore normal proliferation of neural plate precursors, thereby preventing pathological expansion. These findings establish ALDH1L1 as a previously unrecognized enzymatic link between vitamin B9 and retinoic acid signaling, revealing how FA supplementation safeguards neural development and suggesting opportunities to refine preventive strategies for NTDs.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.681787v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.733673","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Edri, T., Abbou-Levy, T., Cohen, D., Inacio, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_69b8e00118e3","title":"Cell size reduction scales spindle elongation but not chromosome segregation in C. elegans","content":"How embryos adapt their internal cellular machinery to reductions in cell size during development remains a fundamental question in cell biology1--11. Here, we use high-resolution lattice light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis to quantify lineage-resolved mitotic spindle and chromosome segregation dynamics from the 2- to 64-cell stages in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. While spindle length scales with cell size across both wild-type and size-perturbed embryos, chromosome segregation dynamics remain largely invariant, suggesting that distinct mechanisms govern these mitotic processes. Combining femtosecond laser ablation12,13 with large-scale electron tomography14, we find that central spindle microtubules mediate chromosome segregation dynamics and remain uncoupled from cell size across all stages of early development. In contrast, spindle elongation is driven by cortically anchored motor proteins and astral microtubules, rendering it sensitive to cell size12,13,15--17. Incorporating these experimental results into an extended stoichiometric model for both the spindle and chromosomes, we find that allowing only cell size and microtubule catastrophe rates to vary reproduces elongation dynamics across development. The same model also accounts for centrosome separation and pronuclear positioning in the one-cell C. elegans embryo18, spindle-length scaling across nematode species spanning ~100 million years of divergence17, and spindle rotation in human cells19. Thus, a unified stoichiometric framework provides a predictive, mechanistic account of spindle and nuclear dynamics across scales and species.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681585v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.733965","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Okafornta, C.

Human genetic studies reveal that loss-of-function (LoF) variants in 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) confer robust protection against advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, establishing HSD17B13 as a critical genetic modifier of MASH severity. Yet the mechanisms linking HSD17B13 activity to fibrogenic progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that both wild-type and catalytically deficient HSD17B13 (mHSD) localize to lipid droplets (LDs) in cultured human hepatocytes, but only catalytically active HSD17B13 enhances hepatocellular lipid accumulation and markedly upregulates the lipogenic transcriptional regulator carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). This HSD17B13-driven lipogenic axis elicits potent paracrine activation of LX2 stellate cells, both in hepatocyte-HSC co-culture and in response to hepatocyte-conditioned medium (CM). Screening of candidate signaling mediators revealed that transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFb-1) is uniquely and strongly upregulated by active HSD17B13, with minimal induction by mHSD. Remarkably, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TGFB1 or neutralization of active TGFb-1 protein abolishes CM-induced LX2 activation and collagen synthesis. Collectively, these findings identify HSD17B13 as a dual metabolic and profibrotic effector that drives TGFb-1-dependent HSC activation, thereby linking hepatocellular lipid dysregulation to fibrogenic progression and providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how HSD17B13 contributes to MASH pathogenesis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682191v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.734254","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Raymond, N., Lifshitz, L., Min, K., Chidley, C., Isaac, G., Yenilmez, B.

PRLR-induced JAK/STAT signaling is dynamic, involving changes in spatial organization of signaling molecules. Thus, the spatial organization of PRLR could have strong implications on signaling output. Internalization has been shown and modeled in other signaling pathways but has not been considered in a mathematical model of PRLR signaling. Here, we use live-cell fluorescence imaging, reconstitution approaches, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to inform a mathematical model of PRLR signaling. Internal PRLR localization is observed in primary pancreatic tissue and in an engineered PRLR expression system. Our imaging data indicate the presence of intracellular and plasma membrane-bound receptor populations. We use FCS to resolve the membrane-bound PRLR population. Based on our data, we include internalization dynamics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of PRLR signaling. We employ the model to explore how the spatial heterogeneity of PRLR affects downstream signaling. We show that the model is more sensitive to PRLR trafficking rates and ability to promote signaling than to its initial spatial distribution. Our data underscore the versatility of a modeling-imaging framework to quantitatively understand signal transduction in and beyond {beta}-cells.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682359v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.734803","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Cherchia, L., Fraser, S.

Although the role of BubR1 in SAC signaling has been extensively investigated, the function of its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain remains poorly understood. In this study, we first established the essential role of the BubR1 TPR domain in SAC signaling. Guided by the resolved cryo-EM structure of the MCC-APC/C complex, we identified and characterized several interactions involving this domain with Mad2, Cdc20APC/C, Apc2. Furthermore, we discovered an intramolecular interaction between the TPR domain and downstream residues of BubR1, which appears to organize a structure resembling a lasso that incorporates four Cdc20APC/C-binding elements, thereby enhancing engagement with Cdc20 in the APC/C. Functional and biochemical analyses demonstrated that these interactions collectively promote MCC assembly and MCC-APC/C binding, enabling rapid SAC activation in response to microtubule-kinetochore attachment defects.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682252v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.735063","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Lei, T., Zhang, M., Wang, Y., Li, M., Wang, Y., Zhang, G.","raw_content_length":1191,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.795,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cdc20APC/C","the MCC-APC/C","Mad2","BubR1","BubR1 TPR","TPR","SAC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1191,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["TPR domain","mitotic checkpoint","MCC formation","MCC","the key component","the mitotic checkpoint","a surveillance mechanism","accurate chromosome segregation","the assembly","the mitotic checkpoint complex"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["TPR domain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"TPR domain":2.0,"mitotic checkpoint":2.0,"MCC formation":2.0,"MCC":2.0,"the key component":1.0,"the mitotic checkpoint":1.0,"a surveillance mechanism":1.0,"accurate chromosome segregation":1.0,"the assembly":1.0,"the mitotic checkpoint complex":1.0}},"age_hours":30.76469615972222,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.808,"joy":0.0128,"surprise":0.0068,"sadness":0.008,"fear":0.0971,"anger":0.0269,"disgust":0.0403},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes basic research into the function of the BubR1 protein and its role in chromosome segregation.

Targeting this aberrant methylation may be a potential therapeutic strategy. EBV+ gastric cancer cell lines (YCCEL1, SNU719) and EBV- lines (AGS, SNU16, MKN74) were treated with a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor (DNMT), decitabine (DCB), for three days followed by RNA sequencing to identify EBV-specific responses. DNA methylation profiling by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed in EBV+ cell-lines and integrated with expression data to identify epigenetically regulated networks. While DCB induced broad transcriptional changes across all lines, EBV+ cells exhibited the strongest transcriptional response, sharing many upregulated genes. Many of these EBV+ specific genes were expressed at lower baseline levels in EBV+ tumors from TCGA. DCB predominantly reduced methylation at highly methylated intergenic CpGs, with a subset of promoters undergoing significant demethylation. Integrated analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between promoter demethylation and gene expression, implicating multiple cancer-relevant pathways. Upstream regulator analysis and motif enrichment indicated that regions losing methylation were enriched for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) binding motifs, suggesting that DCB-mediated demethylation restores RA pathway accessibility and transcriptional activity. Further, inhibiting RAR signaling reduced DCB induced apoptosis. Although DCB can induce both host gene re-expression and viral lytic gene activation in EBV-positive tumors, its impact on RA signaling in EBVaGC has not been studied. Decitabine promotes extensive epigenetic reprogramming in EBVaGC, with preferential effects in CIMP-positive, EBV-infected cell lines.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682272v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.735804","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Preston-Alp, S., Wang, Y., Bergonzoni, M., Kossenkov, A., Soldan, S.

Whole-brain analyses revealed greater activation for externalized compared to internalized sound sources in the left superior temporal gyrus, including the planum temporale, the cerebellum and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Internalized sounds elicited greater relative activity in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Direct comparison between the two externalized conditions revealed stronger left superior temporal gyrus activation for reverberant sounds, while anechoic sounds preferentially activated the right middle temporal gyrus.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_8afc729ddeb1","title":"Noradrenergic Modulation of an Amygdalo","content":"Emotional and cognitive processing rely on communication between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The BLA regulates mPFC both directly and indirectly via the medial sub-division of the medial dorsal thalamus (MDm). Although the BLA projection to MDm has been established anatomically, less is known about the functional properties of this synapse. Here, using patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics in ex vivo mouse brain slices, we found that BLA neurons make potent synaptic connections onto MDm neurons capable of evoking action potentials. The site of this BLA input overlaps with strong innervation from locus coeruleus norepinephrine (NE) axons. We found that NE acts via 2-adrenergic receptors to strongly reduce excitatory postsynaptic currents from BLA to MDm. NE also decreases the release probability of BLA axon terminals through a presynaptic mechanism. Postsynaptically, NE depolarizes MDm neurons and increases their tonic firing rates. These findings show that NE, whose levels are elevated during arousal and stress, can suppress transmission of affective information from BLA into MDm, thereby blunting this potent indirect pathway from BLA to mPFC.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682083v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.736682","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Yang, T.

The neurophysiological underpinnings of content-preferential organization in the developing MTL are largely unknown. Here we utilized rare electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients who completed a visual scene recognition memory task to systematically examine the neurophysiological underpinnings of memory formation along the MTL long axis. The timing of high-frequency activity (HFA, ~70-150 Hz) differed between the posterior and anterior MTL, peaking after scene onset in the posterior MTL and around scene category response (indoor/outdoor scene categorization) in the anterior MTL. Further, in the posterior MTL, HFA was predictive of successful memory formation and positively linked to memory performance, highlighting the importance of posterior MTL HFA to memory formation. In contrast, theta frequency in the anterior MTL was linked to memory performance, and theta-HFA phase-amplitude coupling before scene category responses was predictive of successful memory formation, highlighting the importance of anterior MTL theta oscillations to memory formation. Our findings establish distinct neurophysiological features along the posterior-to-anterior axis of the developing MTL that differentially support the representation of perceptual and conceptual information during memory formation.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682334v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.736976","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Yin, Q., Dede, A.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_83171c5695a8","title":"Automated cell naming reveals reproducible and variable features of ascidian embryogenesis","content":"Ascidians develop with highly reproducible cell lineages, making them ideal models for quantitative comparisons of morphogenesis between individuals and species. Yet, identifying corresponding cells across embryos has so far relied on slow, manual annotation following the Conklin nomenclature, which limits scalability and consistency. We present an automated framework that assigns cell identities in three-dimensional time-lapse reconstructions of ascidian embryos by transferring names from a reference set of manually curated embryos. The process operates in two steps: an initiation phase, which globally aligns early embryos to establish initial correspondences, and a propagation phase, which propagates names through time and cell divisions by comparing the pattern of contacts each cell forms with its neighbors. Applied to eight wild-type Phallusia mammillata and one Ascidiella aspersa embryo, the pipeline assigns consistent names up to stages containing about 700 cells, corrects inconsistencies in earlier datasets, and extends Conklin's rules to internal tissues beyond gastrulation. Using this unified reference, we quantify natural variability in division timing and orientation, confirming the global robustness and revealing local variability of ascidian morphogenesis. The same framework also demonstrates its use to quantitatively phenotype experimentally perturbed embryos, such as those with inhibited ERK signaling. This work provides both a validated collection of coherently named ascidian embryos and open-source tools for automated cell identification and phenotypic comparison, establishing a foundation for systematic, quantitative, and evolutionary analyses of animal development.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.681089v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.737816","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Biasuz, K., Jammoul, H., Gallean, B., Asloudj, Y., Laussu, J., Lemaire, P., Malandain, G.","raw_content_length":1712,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.135,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Conklin"],"locations":["Phallusia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1712,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Automated cell naming reveals","reproducible and variable features","ascidian embryogenesis","Ascidians","highly reproducible cell lineages","them","quantitative comparisons","morphogenesis","individuals","species"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Automated cell naming reveals":2.0,"reproducible and variable features":2.0,"ascidian embryogenesis":2.0,"Ascidians":1.0,"highly reproducible cell lineages":1.0,"them":1.0,"quantitative comparisons":1.0,"morphogenesis":1.0,"individuals":1.0,"species":1.0}},"age_hours":30.764813817222223,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9533,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0164,"sadness":0.003,"fear":0.0023,"anger":0.0089,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents an automated framework for cell identification in ascidian embryos, enabling quantitative comparisons of morphogenesis.

The resistome profiles revealed high abundances of resistance genes against sulfonamides (sul1, sul2 ), aminoglycosides (aadS), and macrolides/streptogramins (msrE, mphE). To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first report of antiseptic resistance genes (qacE{Delta}1, qacL) in hospital wastewater in the Philippines. Resistance genes of critical concern were also detected, including those conferring resistance to {beta}-lactams (blaOXA, blaTEM, blaGES, blaNDM, blaKPC), colistins (mcr-5 ), and tetracyclines (tet(C), tet(A), tet(L), tet(M)). Bacterial composition was dominated by the phylum Pseudomonadota, with high abundances of the genera Stenotrophomonas, Rhodococcus, and Pseudomonas, while ESKAPEE pathogens were detected at lower levels. A wide diversity of mobile genetic elements associated with multiple drug classes, including antiseptic and disinfectant resistance genes was observed.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_03a0fb221686","title":"Synthesis of perfluorooctanoic acid","content":"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic fluorinated compounds used widely in industrial and consumer products. They are unusually stable due to carbon-fluorine bonds and resistant to degradation, making them persistent contaminants in water, soil, and biota. PFAS are associated with adverse health effects in humans including cancer and liver disease. The effects of PFAS on human-associated bacteria are largely unexplored, a significant gap in knowledge because these bacteria are exposed to PFAS in vivo at sites including the colon and bladder. One of the best studied PFAS compounds is perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an eight-carbon perfluorinated carboxylic acid whose structure is analogous to a fatty acid. Here, we cultured Enterococcus faecalis, a Gram-positive bacterium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, in growth medium supplemented with PFOA and corresponding control conditions and performed lipidomic analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to elucidate lipid remodeling in response to PFOA exposure. Strikingly, novel fluoroalkyl-containing membrane lipids are synthesized by both of these bacteria, with each species synthesizing unique fluoroalkyl-lipids. Moreover, a high-level daptomycin-resistant strain of E. faecalis produces strikingly high levels of fluoroalkyl-lipids, demonstrating that prior antibiotic exposure and concomitant effects on bacterial evolution can alter bacterial interactions with PFAS. Because bacterial lipids are important immunomodulators in vivo, we propose that PFAS-containing bacterial lipids may be novel mediators of host-microbe-pollutant interactions. Our results also establish a novel mechanism for the bioaccumulation of PFOA and, potentially, for bioremediation of PFOA in biological systems such as the human gastrointestinal tract.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682380v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.738377","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Guan, Z., Uppuluri, A., Chen, G., Palmer, K.","raw_content_length":1867,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PFOA","Pseudomonas","Enterococcus","PFAS","Gram"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1867,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PFAS","Synthesis","perfluorooctanoic acid","Per-","polyfluoroalkyl substances","synthetic fluorinated compounds","industrial and consumer products","carbon-fluorine bonds","degradation","them"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PFAS":3.0,"Synthesis":2.0,"perfluorooctanoic acid":2.0,"Per-":1.0,"polyfluoroalkyl substances":1.0,"synthetic fluorinated compounds":1.0,"industrial and consumer products":1.0,"carbon-fluorine bonds":1.0,"degradation":1.0,"them":1.0}},"age_hours":30.764845878055553,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.045,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.791,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4683,"joy":0.0019,"surprise":0.0099,"sadness":0.0382,"fear":0.0439,"anger":0.0285,"disgust":0.4093},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies a novel mechanism for PFOA bioaccumulation and potential bioremediation by demonstrating that bacteria can synthesize fluoroalkyl-containing membrane lipids when exposed to PFOA.

The availability of differenct pan-specific antibodies to assess global O-GlcNAc levels, and variability in Western blot results has hindered cross-study reproducibility and interpretation. In this study, we applied optimized immunoblotting protocols using both CTD110.6 and RL2 O-GlcNAc antibodies, alongside subcellular fractionation, to investigate temporal and sex-specific changes in cardiac O-GlcNAcylation during pressure overload hypertrophy (POH) from transverse aortic constriction (TAC) during early (1-week POH, 1wTAC) and chonic (6-weeks POH, 6wTAC) POH in mice. Global O-GlcNAc levels were elevated in early POH and returned to baseline in chronic POH, consistent across both antibodies and sexes. Subcellular fractionation revealed persistent O-GlcNAc elevations in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions in chronic POH for both sexes, which were not detected in unfractionated samples. Female mice exhibited significantly higher O-GlcNAc levels than males during POH, particularly at early POH, highlighting sex-specific regulation. OGT and OGA protein levels also varied by compartment and sex, suggesting differential enzymatic control. In conclusion, our findings underscore the importance of methodological rigor in O-GlcNAc detection and demonstrate that fractionation enhances sensitivity to subtle changes in cardiac O-GlcNAcylation. Our principal new findings are protein O-GlcNAcylation dysregulation continues from early POH (1wTAC) into chronic POH (6wTAC groups) along with showing differences in O-GlcNAc levels between males and females during POH. These results provide new insights into the temporal and sex-dependent dynamics of O-GlcNAc signaling in POH and support its potential as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682429v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.738687","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Ledee, D.

Automated image segmentation using deep learning has emerged as a transformative tool for identifying colorectal abnormalities in medical imaging. This study conducts a comparative analysis of three prominent deep learning architectures--U-Net, SegNet, and ResNet--for colorectal cancer image segmentation, evaluating their performance on a custom dataset comprising 1,800 images (1,000 polyp images from the Kvasir-SEG dataset and 800 polyp-free images from the WCE Curated Colon Dataset). The dataset was preprocessed to a uniform resolution of 256 x 256 pixels and partitioned into training, validation, and test sets. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that U-Net outperforms SegNet and ResNet, achieving superior segmentation accuracy (validation accuracy of 0.95) and robustness, particularly when trained on datasets that include negative samples.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_fd5fe789fb33","title":"Profiling of RNA 8","content":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are environmentally ubiquitous and known to have pervasive impacts on cellular homeostasis. RNA is vulnerable to oxidative chemical alterations from a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources. The most common chemical modification resulting from ROS exposure to RNA is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)--an oxidized form of the canonical guanine (G) nucleobase. While 8-oxoG modifications are known to impact mRNA processing, understanding the broader biological impact of 8-oxoG requires knowledge of how these modifications accumulate. In this work, we assessed the disparate enrichment of 8-oxoG modifications within RNAs in the E. coli transcriptome using an RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing technique with a high-affinity 8-oxoG antibody (8-oxoG-RIP-Seq). Our investigation of the RNA 8-oxoG enrichment landscape uncovered several intrinsic RNA characteristics that correlate with 8-oxoG enrichment. These findings suggest intrinsic characteristics of RNA, most notably relative abundance, CDS length, and G nucleotide composition, significantly influence RNA 8-oxoG accumulation. We harnessed these intrinsic characteristics to construct a simple multiple linear regression model that predicts RNA 8-oxoG accumulation, which we validated in E. coli. This model was subsequently applied to predict 8-oxoG enriched RNA species in four other bacterial species spanning a wide range of oxidative stress tolerances; these predictions suggest that 8-oxoG accumulation is largely species dependent, with limited overlap in RNAs and functional pathways that are more susceptible to elevated levels of 8-oxoG accumulation. Overall, these findings better inform understanding of RNA 8-oxoG patterns in bacteria and have broader impacts towards advancing knowledge of the connection between RNA oxidation and cellular homeostasis.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682464v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.739658","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Burroughs, M.

We previously developed a patented praziquantel derivative, DW-3-15, which demonstrated potent broad-spectrum schistosomicidal activity through SjHAT1 inhibition. Here, the full-length SjHAT1 cDNA is cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. The amino acids encoded by the cDNA retains conserved catalytic residues of acetyltransferases although sharing only 34% identity with mammalian orthologs. Phylogenetic analyses place it in a distinct clade, indicating its divergence specific to Schistosoma species. The expression profiling of SjHAT1 reveals stage- and sex-specific patterns. Fluorescence in situ hybridization localizes SjHAT1 predominantly in female vitellaria and male parenchyma near the gynecophoral canal. Knockdown of SjHAT1 impairs worm survival, reduces female oviposition and disrupts ovarian and vitelline morphology both in vitro and in vivo. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that SjHAT1 knockdown disrupts {beta}-alanyl-tryptamine pheromone signaling via downregulation of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase in males and multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 in females. Through exploring this dual-sex regulatory mechanisms, SjHAT1 may emerge as a promising therapeutic target for interrupting schistosomiasis transmission.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.682244v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.739927","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Xu, J., Wang, Y.-X., Huang, P., Zhang, Y., Sun, H., Zhan, T.-Z., Xia, C.-M.","raw_content_length":1388,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Histone"],"persons":["Knockdown"],"locations":["Schistosoma","vitellaria","SjHAT1"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1388,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Schistosoma japonicum","Histone Acetyltransferase","SjHAT1","A Novel Anti","Schistosomiasis","a critical global health issue","novel therapies","emerging praziquantel resistance","a patented praziquantel derivative","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Schistosoma japonicum":2.0,"Histone Acetyltransferase":2.0,"SjHAT1":2.0,"A Novel Anti":2.0,"Schistosomiasis":1.0,"a critical global health issue":1.0,"novel therapies":1.0,"emerging praziquantel resistance":1.0,"a patented praziquantel derivative":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":30.764920494166667,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.194,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8656,"joy":0.0381,"surprise":0.0358,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0179,"anger":0.0192,"disgust":0.0185},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":true,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into a novel therapeutic target for schistosomiasis.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_9ee6e782c2a8","title":"The microbiota elicits compensatory adaptation in a seasonally","content":"Seasonal adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster is a model for understanding the evolutionary responses of organisms to cyclical environmental changes, including roles played by associated microorganisms ('microbiota'). Here we examined how the microbiota influences D. melanogaster seasonal adaptation by rearing flies in outdoor mesocosms, fed diets inoculated with different bacterial strains that have distinct influences on the flies' life history. The bacterial treatments influenced fly population dynamics and microbiota composition over a summer-to-fall season. The developmental phenotype of the treated flies initially differed but converged over time in flies reared with a complete microbial community. Conversely, rearing the flies free of their colonizing microorganisms revealed that the bacterial treatments led to evolution of distinct developmental phenotypes. The development time of flies from the different treatments consistently adapted to compensate for the direct influence of the bacteria on host development; e.g., flies evolved faster development times if they were inoculated with microbes that slowed development. This compensatory trend was apparent in flies reared in a second location and season, and is consistent with a previous report of wild-sampled flies whose development phenotype segregated with their microbiota composition. Together, these results reveal that microbiota-dependent selection consistently elicits compensatory adaptation in seasonally-evolving flies, which we conclude is a mechanism whereby horizontally-acquired, low-fidelity microbial partners can shape the evolution of their animal hosts.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682128v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.740206","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Peterson, D., Kreutz, R., Jackson, P., Pech, H.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_65eb3d365f22","title":"A mathematical kinetic model of memory in Bacillus subtilis spore germination","content":"Dormant Bacillus subtilis spores germinate through interaction of germinants with germination receptors (GRs). Subsequently, the activated GR signal is transduced to SpoVA proteins that constitute transport channels. SpoVA channel opening then leads to calcium dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) release and completion of spore germination. Spores are known to exhibit memory in germination, as spores given an initial short germinant pulse respond more readily to a second pulse. We have developed a mathematical model to identify a minimal reconstructed molecular network that is crucial for germination kinetics leading to memory of germinant exposure; the model reproduces experimental double germinant pulse germination curves. Analysis of the reconstructed network indicates that a minimal set of inactive and active GRs and a SpoVA channel in three states - closed inactive, closed active and open - is needed to reproduce memory. Spore germination memory is introduced in the network by the activation and deactivation rates of GRs, and by the interplay between activation of closed SpoVA channels and their rate of opening and closing.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682329v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.740467","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"de Koster, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_eb63176818c9","title":"A reference brain for the clonal raider ant","content":"Ants exhibit remarkable collective and social behaviors, such as alloparental care, chemical communication, homing, and cooperative group hygiene. The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the emerging clonal raider ant neuroscience community and reveals novel features of the species' neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.679875v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.740779","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":269,"author":"Frank, D.

We assembled a reference of 44,008 mosaic SNVs and 2,059 Indels, cross-validation between platforms to expose limits of short-read analysis. We also partitioned the genome by mappability to examine the impact of genomic context, added a negative reference set, and accounted for culture-derived mutations. When seven institutions applied eleven algorithms to mixture data, call sets were largely discordant across tools and replicates, partly reflecting stochastic presence of low-VAF mutations in biological replicants. For >2% VAF SNVs, sensitivity and precision approached ~80% at > 300x, with little gain from additional sequencing.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6f32bf2180d3","title":"Mechanical Cues Regulate Estrogen and Progesterone","content":"The endometrium, the mucosal lining of the uterus, is a highly regenerative tissue that undergoes cyclic remodeling guided by tightly regulated levels of estrogen and progesterone. Stromal cells are embedded within the connective tissue of the endometrium and contribute to the rapidly changing extracellular matrix (ECM). With hormone exposure, endometrial stromal cells undergo decidualization, which alters their morphology and protein secretion. While an increase in tissue modulus is associated with gynecological diseases, the relationship between mechanical properties, hormone exposure, and ECM deposition remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how both stiffness and hormones regulate ECM deposition by human endometrial stromal cells during decidualization. Using metabolic labeling with sugar analogs and click chemistry, we measure newly secreted ECM proteins deposited by endometrial stromal cells during decidualization. Additionally, we study the nascent ECM in response to different mechanical properties using hyaluronic acid hydrogels. To increase throughput and reproducibility, we designed an automated ImageJ-based workflow for unbiased quantification of nascent ECM deposition. Our results demonstrate that hormones induce decidualization, characterized by F-actin stress fiber formation and prolactin secretion. In addition, we show that decidualization on hydrogels is characterized by an increase in nascent ECM deposition which depends on the initial hydrogel modulus. In contrast, endometrial stromal cells on glass show little change in nascent ECM deposition during hormone exposure. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that both mechanical and biochemical cues regulate ECM deposition during endometrial remodeling. These observations may provide new insights towards future studies addressing the mechanisms of ECM remodeling in gynecological diseases.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.14.682403v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-14T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:34.745663","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Hinds, G.
