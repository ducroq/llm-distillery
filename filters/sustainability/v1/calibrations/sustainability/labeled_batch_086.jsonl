These soundings were categorized based on their geographical occurrence into three hail-prone environments across Luzon, Philippines. For each case, key parameters describing instability, vertical wind structure, and moisture were calculated to assess their relationship to hail formation. The probability of hail occurrence, expressed as a function of W$_{\\text{MAX}}$ ($\\sqrt{2 \\times \\text{CAPE}}$) and 0-6 km bulk shear (DLS), revealed patterns distinct from those reported in other regions. Hail events in Luzon were most likely under high CAPE conditions, where boundary-layer moisture was sufficient, mid- and low-level lapse rates were steep, and lifting condensation levels were high. Surprisingly, weak DLS was common across Luzon hail environments, diverging from existing severe weather climatologies, yet large DCAPE indicated environments conducive to damaging wind events. When DLS was replaced with the shear magnitude between the cloud base and equilibrium level, the probability of hail occurrence increased, better aligning with global severe weather climatologies. This finding is supported by hodograph analyses, which show largely unidirectional wind profiles: strong speed shear aloft but weak directional shear in the low-levels. Parameters such as W$_{\\text{MAX}}$SHEAR, W$_{\\text{MAX}}$SHEAR$_{\\text{LCL-EL}}$, and BWD$_{\\text{LCL-EL}}$ emerge as potential discriminators between non-severe and severe thunderstorms capable of producing hail, and as useful metrics for assessing convective storm severity in Luzon and possibly countrywide. Finally, two recurring severe setups conducive to hail were identified: (1) an easterly regime associated with trade winds, and (2) a westerly regime linked to the Asian summer monsoon.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09530","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.983397","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physics","physicsao-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":264,"author":"Generich H.

First, we benchmark vertical ionization potentials for 22 3d transition metal complexes against published high-accuracy ph-AFQMC values in a double zeta basis set. We then compute the vertical ionization potential for a set of six metallocenes using our best-performing protocol, alongside ph-AFQMC using a configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial state. We also analyze the performance of canonical coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles and perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), as well as its local approximation using domain-based local pair natural orbitals (DLPNO-CCSD(T1)) using different reference orbitals. To reach the complete-basis-set (CBS) limit, we examine several extrapolation schemes and report CBS-limit ph-AFQMC and CCSD(T) values alongside experimental results. We find that ph-AFQMC with the best-performing trial in a triple zeta basis, followed by CBS correction from DLPNO-CCSD(T1) with unrestricted B3LYP reference orbitals, yields small deviations from experiment at modest cost. Using a CISD trial state in ph-AFQMC gives the closest agreement with experiment (errors < 2 kcal/mol), albeit with lower scalability.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09532","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.983808","language":"en","tags":["physicschem-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Hung T.

These rates depend non-linearly on local density and temperature, and are thus sensitive to turbulent fluctuations. We present an analysis of atomic rates and their dependence on turbulent fluctuations, obtained from GRILLIX edge turbulence simulations in detached divertor conditions. Ionization, recombination and radiation rates are evaluated in turbulent and corresponding mean-field states, and their differences are discussed. While the effect is minimal in attached conditions with low fluctuation amplitudes (< 50% of the background), pronounced discrepancies emerge in detached conditions with high fluctuation amplitudes (> 300% of the background). Local ionization and radiation rates obtained from turbulent inputs are up to a factor of ~2 lower than rates obtained from mean-field inputs. The rate reduction is the result of the particular anti-correlation of electron density and temperature in detached conditions. When factoring out correlations, the turbulent rate approximately recovers to the mean-field rate. When arranged to correlate positively, the turbulent ionization rate instead increases by a factor of ~3. Our results demonstrate that the common method of evaluating rates with mean-field plasma inputs can introduce systematic errors to particle and energy balances, particularly in detached conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09579","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.984604","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physics","physicsplasm-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Konrad Eder, Wladimir Zholobenko, Andreas Stegmeir, Kaiyu Zhang, Frank Jenko","raw_content_length":1567,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1566,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The impact","plasma turbulence","atomic reaction rates","detached divertors","turbulent fluctuations","arXiv251009579v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Numerical plasma models","the edge","scrape-off layer"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The impact":2.0,"plasma turbulence":2.0,"atomic reaction rates":2.0,"detached divertors":2.0,"turbulent fluctuations":2.0,"arXiv251009579v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Numerical plasma models":1.0,"the edge":1.0,"scrape-off layer":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7765000066666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":4.36,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7727,"joy":0.0119,"surprise":0.0773,"sadness":0.0114,"fear":0.0715,"anger":0.0394,"disgust":0.0159},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the impact of plasma turbulence on atomic reaction rates in detached divertors, which are relevant to fusion energy.

Experiments were carried out in a range of initial ion concentrations (1-100 mM), porous media particle sizes (63 um and 500 um), and varying mixture ratios of metal ion concentrations. For single-ion magnetophoresis, paramagnetic MnCl2 migrated toward the magnet surface, with an enrichment of approximately 2-4 percent near regions of high magnetic field. Conversely, diamagnetic ZnCl2 moved away from regions of highest magnetic field gradients, with depletion levels of 0.5-1.8 percent relative to the initial concentration. Our results demonstrate that magnetophoresis is directly proportional to porous media particle size, increasing with larger particle sizes, a trend attributed to the reduced drag forces experienced by the ions in media with larger particles. Interestingly, in binary mixtures, both MnCl2 and ZnCl2 migrated toward regions of highest magnetic field, contrary to their individual behaviors. The magnetophoretic effect of MnCl2 was diminished with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2, indicating interactions between the two ions. These findings suggest that both metal ions undergo field-induced cluster formation, with cluster sizes in the micrometer range, in both single and binary ion systems.

This paper has two objectives: (1) to report the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D (distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network scenarios are also discussed.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09384","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.991482","language":"en","tags":["research","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Takeo Sasai, Giacomo Borraccini, Yue-Kai Huang, Hideki Nishizawa, Zehao Wang, Tingjun Chen, Yoshiaki Sone, Minami Takahashi, Tatsuya Matsumura, Masanori Nakamura, Etsushi Yamazaki, Koichi Takasugi, Ting Wang, Yoshiaki Kisaka","raw_content_length":1198,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["First Field Trial","QoT","OLT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1197,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optical Link Tomography","First Field Trial","4D Extension","OLT","arXiv251009384v1","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Optical link tomography","a rapidly evolving field"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["OLT"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optical Link Tomography":2.0,"First Field Trial":2.0,"4D Extension":2.0,"OLT":2.0,"arXiv251009384v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Optical link tomography":1.0,"a rapidly evolving field":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776754038611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8025,"joy":0.0946,"surprise":0.0762,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0059,"anger":0.012,"disgust":0.0032},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"technology_deployment","innovation_stage":"pilot","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reports on a field trial of optical link tomography (OLT) using commercial transponders.

However, achieving such low \\$g^{(2)}(0)\\$ remains experimentally challenging. We therefore propose a decoy-like QKD protocol that relaxes this constraint while maintaining security. This enables the use of many SPSs with \\$g^{(2)}(0) > \\$0.1, routinely achieved in experiments but rarely considered viable for QKD. Monte Carlo simulations and our experiment from defects in hexagonal boron nitride show that, under linear loss, \\$g^{(2)}(0)\\$ remains constant, whereas photon-number-splitting (PNS) attacks introduce nonlinear effects that modify the measured \\$g^{(2)}(0)\\$ statistics. Exploiting this \\$g^{(2)}(0)\\$ variation as a diagnostic tool, our protocol detects PNS attacks analogously to decoy-state methods. Both single- and two-photon pulses consequently securely contribute to the secret key rate. Our protocol outperforms the Gottesman--Lo--Lutkenhaus--Preskill (GLLP) framework under high channel loss across various solid-state SPSs and is applicable to the satellite-based communication. Since \\$g^{(2)}(0)\\$ can be extracted from standard QKD experiments, no additional hardware is required. The relaxed \\$g^{(2)}(0)\\$ requirement simplifies the laser system for SPS generation.

They provide the flexibility to accurately model a heterogeneous population with time and location varying, person-specific interactions as well as detailed governmental mobility restrictions. Typically, for accuracy, each person is modelled separately. This however may make computational time prohibitive when the city population and the simulated time is large. In this paper, we dig deeper into the underlying probabilistic structure of a generic, locally detailed ABS for epidemiology to arrive at modifications that allow smaller models (models with less number of agents) to give accurate statistics for larger ones, thus substantially speeding up the simulation. We observe that simply considering a smaller aggregate model and scaling up the output leads to inaccuracies. We exploit the observation that in the initial disease spread phase, the starting infections create a family tree of infected individuals more-or-less independent of the other trees and are modelled well as a multi-type super-critical branching process. Further, although this branching process grows exponentially, the relative proportions amongst the population types stabilise quickly. Once enough people have been infected, the future evolution of the epidemic is closely approximated by its mean field limit with a random starting state. We build upon these insights to develop a shifted, scaled and restart-based algorithm that accurately evaluates the ABS's performance using a much smaller model while carefully reducing the bias that may otherwise arise. We apply our algorithm for Covid-19 epidemic and theoretically support the proposed algorithm through an asymptotic analysis where the population size increases to infinity.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02887","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.994913","language":"en","tags":["q-biope","research","physicssoc-ph","physics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":279,"author":"Daksh Mittal, Sandeep Juneja","raw_content_length":1958,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.395,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Based Simulators"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1957,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Agent Based Simulators","Epidemic Modelling","Simulating Larger Models","Smaller Ones","arXiv220902887v3 Announce Type","Abstract","Agent-based simulators","ABS","a popular epidemiological modelling tool","the impact"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Agent Based Simulators":2.0,"Epidemic Modelling":2.0,"Simulating Larger Models":2.0,"Smaller Ones":2.0,"arXiv220902887v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Agent-based simulators":1.0,"ABS":1.0,"a popular epidemiological modelling tool":1.0,"the impact":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776873524722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8749,"joy":0.0425,"surprise":0.0551,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.009,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm to speed up agent-based simulations for epidemic modeling.

Simultaneously and in the ionosphere's bottom-side, we observed signatures of impact ionization and strong enhancements in the ionospheric electric field, via radar-detection of meter-scale turbulence, and with matching temporal characteristics as that of the magnetospheric observations. We detailed this in a companion paper. In the present article, we place those observations into context with the dayside ionosphere, and describe a remarkably similar event that took place during the May 2024 geospace superstorm. In both cases, fast, eastward-moving electric field structures were excited equatorward of the ionospheric cusp, on closed magnetic field-lines -- observations that challenge existing modes of explanation for electrodynamics in the cusp-region, where most such observations are interpreted in the context of poleward-moving auroral forms. Instead, primarily eastward-moving electric field structures were associated with turbulent Hall currents that are perhaps characteristically excited during geospace storms by wave-particle interactions near magnetospheric equator or by proton precipitation characteristics in the cusp, forming a `parallel-plate capacitor-like effect'.

However, its relatively long acquisition times make it susceptible to patient motion, especially under sparse-view settings used to reduce dose, which can result in severe image artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel framework, joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) with adaptive diffusion model (ADM), that simultaneously addresses motion compensation and sparse-view reconstruction in head CBCT. Leveraging recent advances in diffusion-based generative models, our method integrates a wavelet-domain diffusion prior into an iterative reconstruction pipeline to guide the solution toward anatomically plausible volumes while estimating rigid motion parameters in a blind fashion. We evaluate our method on simulated motion-affected CBCT data derived from real clinical computed tomography (CT) volumes. Experimental results demonstrate that JRM- ADM achieves consistent quantitative improvements over both traditional and learning-based baselines. In highly undersampled cases, JRM-ADM improves peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by more than 4 dB and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) by 0.10 compared to baseline the motion-corrected (MC) reconstruction method. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enable motion-robust and low-dose CBCT imaging, paving the way for improved clinical viability.

Calculations for noise bounds in gene regulation suggest that clustering or cooperative binding of transcription factors decreases signal-to-noise ratios at binding sites. However, clustering of transcription factor molecules around binding sites is frequently observed. We develop two complementary models for clustering transcription factors at binding site sensors that allow us to study information transfer from a signal, the morphogen Bicoid, to a variable relevant to development, namely future cell fates. We find that weak cooperativity or clustering can allow for maximal information transfer, especially about the relevant variable. The timescale of measurement is crucial for predicting the optimal clustering strength: for short measurements, clustering allows for the implementation of a switch, while for long measurements, weak clustering allows the sensor to access maximal developmental information provided in a nonlinear signal. Finally, we find that clustering not only facilitates information maximization about the relevant variable, but also can allow the binding site sensors to achieve optimality in a related optimization goal, the information bottleneck (IB) bound. While the measurement time restricts the region on the information plane that is accessible, changes in clustering in conjunction with changes in the binding energy can shift the binding site along the optimal bound, and towards an optimal trade-off between obtaining information about the signal and obtaining relevant information.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07641","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.998191","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicsbio-ph","preprints","q-biosc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Tamara Mijatovi\\'c, Aim\\'ee R.

We have assembled and synthesized a large and unique set of GMD-related data, compared model predictions with measurements, and identified empirical relationships for GICs in the contiguous United States for this storm.

Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its \"1000CE\" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.999880","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","physicshist-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst","raw_content_length":1703,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Boltzmann","Boltzmann's H"],"persons":["Markov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1702,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Boltzmann brains","arXiv250710959v3 Announce Type","Abstract","you","your perceptions","memories","observational data","a Boltzmann brain","ie a statistical fluctuation","the thermal equilibrium"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Boltzmann brains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Boltzmann brains":2.0,"arXiv250710959v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"you":1.0,"your perceptions":1.0,"memories":1.0,"observational data":1.0,"a Boltzmann brain":1.0,"ie a statistical fluctuation":1.0,"the thermal equilibrium":1.0}},"age_hours":2.777054994722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.3655,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7269,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8227,"joy":0.004,"surprise":0.0365,"sadness":0.0138,"fear":0.0137,"anger":0.0618,"disgust":0.0476},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical physics research exploring the foundations of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Although such systems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger than the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case which consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the bubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. As a first step, Jiang and Krug (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 1006, 2025, A19) proposed a frozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between finite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from simulations as an input. In this study, we further develop this approach into a model where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based on the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. By comparing the predicted collision rate with simulations of bubbles with Stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3, and particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a Taylor Reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and simulations for Froude number $Fr \\leq 0.25$. Beyond this range of bubble Stokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the model's validity. Evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters indicates that particle inertia and settling effects are usually important. Generally, smaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall collision rate.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13878","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.000311","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","physicsflu-dyn","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Timothy T.

However, the Shannon-Hartley theorem sets a hard limit by tying channel capacity to the trade-off between SNR and rate, a central challenge in communication. Inspired by lock-in amplification in electronics, we encode data on THz optical burst carriers so the signal resides beyond the conventional noise band, yielding exceptional robustness. By leveraging a programmable all-degree-of-freedom (All-DoF) modulator, we generate a spatiotemporal topological comb (ST-Comb) that structures light into a vast, highentropy state space for high-dimensional information encoding. Crucially, we find that the associated topological winding number is preserved under diverse perturbations, ensuring stable information encoding and retrieval. This paradigm illustrates how structured light can simultaneously expand channel dimensionality and maintain robustness, charting a pathway to chip-scale, reconfigurable photonic platforms for the PHz era, while also opening previously inaccessible regimes of light-matter interaction.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23093","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.001522","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Dawei Liu, Daijun Luo, Huiming Wang, Xingyuan Zhang, Zhirong Tao, Dana JiaShaner, Zhensheng Tao, Qian Cao, Xiaoshi Zhang, Guangyu Fan, Qiwen Zhan","raw_content_length":1310,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.83,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SNR","Spatiotemporal Topological Combs"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1309,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Spatiotemporal Topological Combs","Robust High","arXiv250923093v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Sculpting light","its independent degrees","freedom","orbital angular momentum","the discrete wavelengths","optical frequency combs"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Spatiotemporal Topological Combs"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Spatiotemporal Topological Combs":2.0,"Robust High":2.0,"arXiv250923093v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Sculpting light":1.0,"its independent degrees":1.0,"freedom":1.0,"orbital angular momentum":1.0,"the discrete wavelengths":1.0,"optical frequency combs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7771168152777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7563,"joy":0.0643,"surprise":0.1053,"sadness":0.0101,"fear":0.0331,"anger":0.0229,"disgust":0.0081},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel approach to optical communication using spatiotemporal topological combs (ST-Combs).

In this multi-center study, we analyzed MRI sequences (T1, T2-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1, and FLAIR) from 1,329 patients across eight centers, with IDH labels available for 1,061 cases. A total of 1,223 radiomic features per case were extracted using PyRadiomics with Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet filters, and both supervised learning (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks were applied, incorporating 38 feature selection/attribute extraction strategies and 24 classifiers. Five-fold cross-validation was performed on UCSF-PDGM and UPENN datasets, and external validation on IvyGAP, TCGA-LGG, and TCGA-GBM, with SHAP analysis conducted for feature interpretability. Multimodal MRI fusion (T1+T2+T1CE+FLAIR) consistently outperformed single-sequence models. The best SSL model (RFE + SVM) achieved 0.93 cross-validation and 0.75 external accuracy, while the top SL model (RFE + Complement Naive Bayes) reached 0.90 and 0.80, respectively. SSL further demonstrated greater robustness to limited sample sizes, maintaining stable performance compared to SL, and SHAP analysis highlighted the amplified role of first-order Root Mean Square (T1CE) and wavelet-based features, strengthening biomarker interpretability. These findings indicate that SSL enhances accuracy, stability, and interpretability in MRI-based IDH prediction, with multimodal MRI fusion providing the most scalable and reliable strategy for non-invasive biomarker discovery in GBM.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25641","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.002333","language":"en","tags":["physicsmed-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Amir Hossein Pouria, Shahram Taeb, Somayeh Sadat Mehrnia, Sajad Jabarzadeh Ghandilu, Mehrdad Oveisi, Arman Rahmim, Mohammad R.

Our treatment number is distinct from other graph searching parameters that use only two states, such as the firefighter problem or Bernshteyn and Lee's inspection number. Vertices represent individuals and edges exist between individuals with close connections. Each vertex starts out as compromised; it can become compromised again even after treatment. Our objective is to treat the entire population so that at the last time-step, no members are vulnerable or compromised, while minimizing the maximum number of treatments that occur at each time-step. This minimum is the treatment number, and it depends on the choice of a pre-determined length of time $r$ that a vertex can remain in a treated state and length of time $s$ that a vertex can remain in a vulnerable state without being treated again. We denote the pathwidth of graph $H$ by $pw(H)$ and prove that the treatment number of $H$ is bounded above by $\\lceil \\frac{1+pw(H)}{r+s}\\rceil$. This equals the best possible lower bound for a cautious treatment plan, defined as one in which each vertex, after being treated for the first time, is treated again within every consecutive $r+s$ time-steps until its last treatment. However, many graphs admit a plan that is not cautious. When $r=s=1$, we find a useful tool for proving lower bounds, show that the treatment number of an $n\\times n$ grid equals $\\lceil\\frac{1+n}{2}\\rceil$, characterize graphs that require only one treatment per time-step, and prove that subdividing one edge can reduce the treatment number. It is known that there are trees with arbitrarily large pathwidth; surprisingly, we prove that for any tree $T$, there is a subdivision of $T$ that requires at most two treatments per time-step.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05313","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.005545","language":"en","tags":["research","physicssoc-ph","physics","preprints","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":309,"author":"N.

Recent work suggested that such a mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells to increase both their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and in turn their fitness. To quantify fluctuations in the partitioning of cellular elements, imaging-based approaches are used, whose accuracy is limited by the difficulty of detecting cell divisions. Our work addresses this gap proposing a general method based on high-throughput flow cytometry measurements coupled with a theoretical framework. We applied our method to a panel of both normal and cancerous human colon cells, showing that different kinds of colon adenocarcinoma cells display very distinct extents of fluctuations in their cytoplasm partition, explained by an asymmetric division of their size. To test the accuracy of our population-level protocol, we directly measure the inherited fractions of cellular elements from extensive time-lapses of live-cell laser scanning microscopy, finding excellent agreement across the cell types. Ultimately, our flow cytometry-based method promises to be accurate and easily applicable to a wide range of biological systems where the quantification of partition fluctuations would help accounting for the observed phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19469","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.005938","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicsbio-ph","preprints","q-biocb","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Domenico Caudo, Chiara Giannattasio, Simone Scalise, Valeria de Turris, Fabio Giavazzi, Giancarlo Ruocco, Giorgio Gosti, Giovanna Peruzzi, Mattia Miotto","raw_content_length":1406,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1405,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Robust assessment","asymmetric division","colon cancer cells","arXiv240919469v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Asymmetric partition","fate determinants","cell division","a hallmark","cell differentiation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a hallmark"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Robust assessment":2.0,"asymmetric division":2.0,"colon cancer cells":2.0,"arXiv240919469v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Asymmetric partition":1.0,"fate determinants":1.0,"cell division":1.0,"a hallmark":1.0,"cell differentiation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7772851366666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.9379999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6124,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8974,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0484,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0141,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0137},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":true,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on understanding asymmetric cell division in colon cancer cells.

Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.007993","language":"en","tags":["q-biope","nlinao","research","physics","physicsbio-ph","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Matthew Asker, Mohamed Swailem, Uwe C.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_dd3ddc04df39","title":"Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan","content":"arXiv:2509.08360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.008839","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","physicsbio-ph","preprints","cond-matsoft","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun","raw_content_length":1476,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IRI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1475,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adsorption Barrier Limits","the Ice Inhibition Activity","Glycan","replace-cross Abstract","Antifreeze glycoproteins","AFGPs","the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition","IRI agents","the molecular basis","their counterintuitive decline"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adsorption Barrier Limits":2.0,"the Ice Inhibition Activity":2.0,"Glycan":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Antifreeze glycoproteins":1.0,"AFGPs":1.0,"the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition":1.0,"IRI agents":1.0,"the molecular basis":1.0,"their counterintuitive decline":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7773885875,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3665000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5267,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.831,"joy":0.0223,"surprise":0.0454,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.0182,"anger":0.0519,"disgust":0.0189},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents molecular dynamics simulations to understand the ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of antifreeze glycoproteins.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_e9f0773c0f56","title":"Entanglement dynamics of light's orbital angular momentum under a Lorentz boost","content":"arXiv:2509.22385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The idea behind entanglement is counterintuitive to any classical viewpoint of physical realism. An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of realities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has been done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this notion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz boost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement. First, we consider co-moving observers, i.e., with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we introduce a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) between them. In the second case, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude probability, i.e., from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero RM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered in all cases. We observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved maximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest (source) frame and asymptotically approaches a minimum at very large velocities close to the light cone (LC). However, from the viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not survive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important observation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be nonlocal, and therefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated through the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show that OAM entanglement is observer dependent, hence, local. Ironically, even entanglement is influenced by motion. Finally, based on this study, one can predict that within photon's frame of reference, there is no OAM relevance, and this property is only emergent at the light-matter interaction limit.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22385","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.009675","language":"en","tags":["research","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","quant-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":292,"author":"Moslem Mahdavifar","raw_content_length":1972,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.46,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Non-Ze","OAM","Non-Zero RM","Lorentz","Bell"],"persons":["Lorentz","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1971,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Entanglement dynamics","lights orbital angular momentum","a Lorentz boost","replace-cross Abstract","The idea","entanglement","any classical viewpoint","physical realism","An entangled state","a nonlocal superposition"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Entanglement dynamics":2.0,"lights orbital angular momentum":2.0,"a Lorentz boost":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The idea":1.0,"entanglement":1.0,"any classical viewpoint":1.0,"physical realism":1.0,"An entangled state":1.0,"a nonlocal superposition":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7774196013888885,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6137,"joy":0.0066,"surprise":0.1955,"sadness":0.0185,"fear":0.0529,"anger":0.0597,"disgust":0.053},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is theoretical research on the behavior of quantum entanglement under relativistic conditions.

The approach draws inspiration from the frequency selectivity and temporal encoding of the cochlea, and uses neuromorphic spike generation to replace conventional signal processing blocks. The goal is to establish a compact, energy-efficient front-end architecture suitable for future implantable systems. Methods: An auditory sensing unit was implemented, consisting of a piezoelectric MEMS cantilever mechanically coupled to a single VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator. This configuration enables FFT-free, frequency-selective sensing and direct spike generation, forming a biomimetic auditory front end. The concept was experimentally examined using controlled mechanical excitation. Results: The sensing unit exhibited frequency-selective detection of mechanical vibrations in the nanometer to tens-of-nanometers displacement range and generated biomimetic spiking waveforms. Spike rate-encoding of the input amplitude was demonstrated, with output spiking frequencies tunable between approximately 100 Hz and 1 kHz depending on the excitation level. The waveform was finally converted to a biphasic shape suitable for cochlear implant stimulation. Significance: Temporal encoding is fundamental to natural auditory signal processing in the nervous system. By implementing this principle through neuromorphic spike encoding, the proposed approach can provide significant benefits for cochlear implants. In addition, the circuit has the potential to reduce footprint, energy consumption, and latencies compared with current commercial solutions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26582","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.010653","language":"en","tags":["research","cond-matmes-hall","physics","physicsbio-ph","preprints","physicsmed-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"T\\'imea N\\'ora T\\\"or\\\"ok, Roland K\\\"ovecs, Ferenc Braun, Zsigmond Pollner, Tam\\'as Zeffer, Nguyen Quoc Kh\\'anh, L\\'aszl\\'o P\\'osa, P\\'eter R\\'ev\\'esz, Heungsoo Kim, Alberto Piqu\\'e, Andr\\'as Halbritter, J\\'anos Volk","raw_content_length":1750,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mott"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1749,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Memristor","replace-cross Abstract","Objective","This work","a low-power"," biomimetic auditory sensing concept","fully implantable cochlear implants","The approach","inspiration","the frequency selectivity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Memristor":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Objective":1.0,"This work":1.0,"a low-power":1.0," biomimetic auditory sensing concept":1.0,"fully implantable cochlear implants":1.0,"The approach":1.0,"inspiration":1.0,"the frequency selectivity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7774490280555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8746,"joy":0.0447,"surprise":0.0479,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.0059,"anger":0.0125,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a prototype auditory sensing unit using a memristor-based oscillator.

{"id":"science_arxiv_eess_1d990d28a3f5","title":"Pinching","content":"arXiv:2510.09137v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The fundamental sensing limit of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is studied from a Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) perspective. Compared to conventional CRB, BCRB is independent of the exact values of sensing parameters and is not restricted by the unbiasedness of the estimator, thus offering a practical and comprehensive lower bound for evaluating sensing performance. A system where multiple targets transmit uplink pilots to a single-waveguide PASS under a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme is analyzed. For the single-target scenario, our analysis reveals a unique mismatch between the sensing centroid (i.e., the optimal PA position) and the distribution centroid (i.e., the center of the target's prior distribution), underscoring the necessity of dynamic PA repositioning. For the multi-target scenario, two target scheduling protocols are proposed: 1) pinch switching (PS), which performs separate pinching beamforming for each time slot, and 2) pinch multiplexing (PM), which applies a single beamforming configuration across all slots. Based on these protocols, both the total power minimization problem under a BCRB threshold and the min-max BCRB problem under a total power constraint are formulated. By leveraging Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, these problems are equivalently converted into a search over PA positions and solved using an element-wise algorithm. Numerical results show that i)~PASS, endowed with large-scale reconfigurability, can significantly enhance the sensing performance compared with conventional fixed-position arrays, and ii)~PS provides more robust performances than PM at the cost of higher computational complexity.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09137","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:14.965948","language":"en","tags":["systems","eesssp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":237,"author":"Hao Jiang, Chongjun Ouyang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan, Zhiguo Ding","raw_content_length":1727,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.185,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TDMA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1726,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251009137v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The fundamental sensing limit","pinching-antenna systems","PASS","Rao","conventional CRB","BCRB","the exact values","parameters"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251009137v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The fundamental sensing limit":1.0,"pinching-antenna systems":1.0,"PASS":1.0,"Rao":1.0,"conventional CRB":1.0,"BCRB":1.0,"the exact values":1.0,"parameters":1.0}},"age_hours":2.777735642777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.847999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5696,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8722,"joy":0.0273,"surprise":0.0686,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0123,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical analysis of pinching-antenna systems (PASS) for improved sensing performance.

Capturing the intra- and cross-layer interactions among different domains for analysis and processing calls for topological algebraic descriptors capable of localizing the homologies of different domains, at different scales, according to the learning task. Our first contribution in this paper is to introduce the Cell MultiComplexes (CMCs), which are novel topological spaces that enable the representation of higher-order interactions among interconnected cell complexes. We introduce cross-Laplacian operators as powerful algebraic descriptors of CMC spaces able to capture different topological invariants, whether global or local, at different resolutions. Using the eigenvectors of these operators as bases for the signal representation, we develop topological signal processing tools for signals defined over CMCs. Then, we focus on the signal spectral representation and on the filtering of noisy flows observed over the cross-edges between different layers of CMCs. We show that a local signal representation based on cross-Laplacians yields a better sparsity/accuracy trade-off compared to monocomplex representations, which provide overcomplete representation of local signals. Finally, we illustrate a topology learning strategy designed to infer second-order cross-cells between layers, with applications to brain networks for encoding inter-module connectivity patterns.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09139","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:14.966787","language":"en","tags":["systems","eesssp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Stefania Sardellitti, Breno C.

{"id":"science_arxiv_eess_49a6f6f77ca6","title":"Impact of HRTF individualisation and head movements in a real/virtual localisation task","content":"arXiv:2510.09161v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The objective of Audio Augmented Reality (AAR) applications are to seamlessly integrate virtual sound sources within a real environment. It is critical for these applications that virtual sources are localised precisely at the intended position, and that the acoustic environments are accurately matched. One effective method for spatialising sound on headphones is through Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). These characterise how the physical features of a listener modify sound waves before they reach the eardrum. This study examines the influence of using individualised HRTFs on the localisation and the perceived realism of virtual sound sources associated with a real visual object. Participants were tasked with localising virtual and real speech sources presented via headphones and through a spherical loudspeaker array, respectively. The assessment focussed on perceived realism and sources location. All sources were associated with one of thirty real visual sources (loudspeakers) arranged in a semi-anechoic room. Various sound source renderings were compared, including single loudspeaker rendering and binaural rendering with individualised or non-individualised HRTFs.

Furthermore, most M-MIMO studies assume narrow-band transmission, neglecting subcarrier intermodulations at the non-linear PA for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, this work investigates the energy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO downlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we model wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a closed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR) under Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the Energy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and a distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding algorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results demonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over $100\\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss. Our findings reveal how the optimal operating point depends on the antenna count, the PA model, and the propagation conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09232","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:14.969881","language":"en","tags":["systems","eesssp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Siddarth Marwaha, Pawel Kryszkiewicz, Eduard A.

Radiologists often begin assessment with rotational Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs) from PET, confirming findings with volumetric slices. This workflow is time-consuming, especially in metastatic cases. Despite their clinical utility, MIPs are underutilized in automated tumor segmentation, where 3D volumetric data remains the norm. We propose an alternative approach that trains segmentation models directly on MIPs, bypassing the need to segment 3D volumes and then project. This better aligns the model with its target domain and yields substantial gains in computational efficiency and training time. We also introduce a novel occlusion correction method that restores MIP annotations occluded by high-intensity structures, improving segmentation. Using the autoPET 2022 Grand Challenge dataset, we evaluate our method against standard 3D pipelines in terms of performance and training/computation efficiency for segmentation and classification, and analyze how MIP count affects segmentation. Our MIP-based approach achieves segmentation performance on par with 3D (<=1% Dice difference, 26.7% better Hausdorff Distance), while reducing training time (convergence time) by 55.8-75.8%, energy per epoch by 71.7-76%, and TFLOPs by two orders of magnitude, highlighting its scalability for clinical use. For classification, using 16 MIPs only as input, we surpass 3D performance while reducing training time by over 10x and energy consumption per epoch by 93.35%.

In contrast to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), CAPAs emit electromagnetic (EM) probing signals through continuous source currents for target sensing, thereby exploiting the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for estimating target locations in the near-field region is developed. To evaluate the NISE performance with CAPAs, the CRB for estimating target locations is derived based on continuous transmit and receive array responses of CAPAs. Subsequently, a CRB minimization problem is formulated to optimize the continuous source current of CAPAs. This results in a non-convex, integral-based functional optimization problem. To address this challenge, the optimal structure of the source current is derived and proven to be spanned by a series of basis functions determined by the system geometry. To solve the CRB minimization problem, a low-complexity subspace manifold gradient descent (SMGD) method is proposed, leveraging the derived optimal structure of the source current. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMGD method and further demonstrate that i)~the proposed SMGD method can effectively solve the CRB minimization problem with reduced computational complexity, and ii)~CAPA achieves a tenfold improvement in sensing performance compared to its SPDA counterpart, due to full exploitation of spatial DoFs.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15007","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:14.995175","language":"en","tags":["systems","eesssp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Hao Jiang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan","raw_content_length":1603,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cram\\'er-Rao Bound Optimization for Near arXiv:2412.15007v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract","MLE"],"persons":["DoFs"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1602,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cramer-Rao Bound Optimization","CAPAs","arXiv241215007v2 Announce Type","Abstract","A Cramer-Rao bound CRB optimization framework","near-field sensing","NISE","continuous-aperture arrays","contrast","conventional spatially discrete arrays"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cramer-Rao Bound Optimization":2.0,"CAPAs":2.0,"arXiv241215007v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"A Cramer-Rao bound CRB optimization framework":1.0,"near-field sensing":1.0,"NISE":1.0,"continuous-aperture arrays":1.0,"contrast":1.0,"conventional spatially discrete arrays":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778720093888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8862,"joy":0.0193,"surprise":0.0569,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0106,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical framework for improving near-field sensing using continuous-aperture arrays.

PnP strategies have demonstrated outstanding performance in various image restoration tasks by exploiting the powerful priors underlying Gaussian denoisers. However, existing PnP methods often lack theoretical convergence guarantees under realistic assumptions due to their ad-hoc nature, resulting in inconsistent behavior. Moreover, even when convergence guarantees are provided, they are typically designed for specific settings or require a considerable computational cost in handling non-quadratic data-fidelity terms and additional constraints, which are key components in many image restoration scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we integrate the PnP paradigm with primal-dual splitting (PDS), an efficient proximal splitting methodology for solving a wide range of convex optimization problems, and develop a general convergent PnP framework. Specifically, we establish theoretical conditions for the convergence of the proposed PnP algorithm under a reasonable assumption. Furthermore, we show that the problem solved by the proposed PnP algorithm is not a standard convex optimization problem but a more general monotone inclusion problem, where we provide a mathematical representation of the solution set. Our approach efficiently handles a broad class of image restoration problems with guaranteed theoretical convergence.

{"id":"science_arxiv_eess_ea02d6f7c3ef","title":"Limited","content":"arXiv:2503.12517v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: While fully-digital precoding achieves superior performance in massive MIMO systems, it comes with significant drawbacks in terms of computational complexity and power consumption, particularly when operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and beyond. Hybrid analog-digital architectures address this by reducing radio frequency (RF) chains while maintaining performance in sparse multipath environments. However, most hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase shifters, which cannot be implemented in real systems. Another practical constraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and array, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a finite set of quantization labels. This paper proposes novel designs for the limited-resolution analog and digital precoders by exploiting two well-known MIMO symbol detection algorithms, namely sphere decoding (SD) and expectation propagation (EP). Unlike prior works that rely on heuristic or sub-optimal designs for the low-resolution hybrid precoder, the proposed transformative MIMO detection-inspired designs are able to achieve optimal and near-optimal solutions. The main objective is to minimize the Euclidean distance between the optimal fully-digital precoder and the hybrid precoder to minimize the degradation caused by the finite resolution of the analog and digital precoders. Taking an alternating optimization approach, we first apply the SD method to find the precoders in each iteration optimally. Then, we apply the lower-complexity EP method which finds a near-optimal solution at a reduced computational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated through extensive numerical simulations, which demonstrate that both SD-based and EP-based hybrid precoding schemes significantly outperform widely-used sub-optimal approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12517","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:14.996900","language":"en","tags":["systems","eesssp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Parisa Ramezani, Alva Kosasih, Emil Bj\\\"ornson","raw_content_length":1946,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.29,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["MIMO"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1945,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv250312517v2 Announce Type","Abstract","fully-digital precoding","superior performance","massive MIMO systems","significant drawbacks","terms","computational complexity and power consumption","millimeter-wave mmWave frequencies","Hybrid analog-digital architectures"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv250312517v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"fully-digital precoding":1.0,"superior performance":1.0,"massive MIMO systems":1.0,"significant drawbacks":1.0,"terms":1.0,"computational complexity and power consumption":1.0,"millimeter-wave mmWave frequencies":1.0,"Hybrid analog-digital architectures":1.0}},"age_hours":2.778781648611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9095,"joy":0.0058,"surprise":0.0278,"sadness":0.0292,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0087,"disgust":0.014},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes novel designs for limited-resolution analog and digital precoders in massive MIMO systems, aiming to reduce power consumption and computational complexity.

As an alternative, a pretrained probabilistic time series model that utilizes transformers with a Prob-Sparse self-attention mechanism is considered. The considered solution is investigated under different time granularities with varying sequence and prediction lengths.

This study was to explore changes in the brain’s nervous system of insomnia patients after TMS treatment and construct a prognostic prediction model.MethodThis study involved collecting EEG data of 15 patients before and after treatment, extracting features (approximate entropy, sample entropy, alignment entropy, power spectral density, median, mean, kurtosis, and skewness), and building an SVR model.ResultsFifteen subjects (8 females, 7 males, mean age 42 years) received 7 days of TMS on the right prefrontal lobe. Five eigenvalues were used to analyze EEG data in 5 frequency bands. Statistically significant indicator eigenvalues (p < 0.05). Paired t-test showed significant differences in PSQI and ISI total scores before and after TMS treatment, indicating its therapeutic effect.

The impact of timeout on momentum in basketball game","content":"IntroductionTimeouts are often viewed by coaches as an important means of intervening in a game, but their impact on the game’s momentum still lacks empirical research. This study aims to evaluate the impact of timeouts on momentum, defined as excellent offensive and defensive performance over a short period in basketball games, and to analyze the moderating role of contextual factors.MethodsA total of 4,051 timeouts from 1,235 elite professional basketball games were analyzed. Momentum was measured at short (48 s), medium (96 s), and long (144 s) intervals before and after each timeout. T-test (or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used to examine the difference in momentum before and after timeouts, and linear mixed models were employed to assess the impact of contextual factors.ResultsTimeouts significantly increased team momentum, particularly when the team was in a disadvantaged status. Conversely, when the team was in an advantageous status, timeouts tended to reduce momentum. Contextual factors significantly moderated the effects of timeouts: better effects were observed during regular game periods, whereas timeouts were less effective in the last 5 min or against high-level opponents. Moreover, the medium- and long-term effects of timeout are more susceptible to contextual modulation, whereas short-term effects remained relatively stable.DiscussionTimeouts are an important intervention to influence momentum in basketball, and their effectiveness depends on game context and team status. These findings provide practical insights for coaches, suggesting that timeout strategies should be tailored to game conditions and situational dynamics to enhance their effectiveness.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1673186","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:20.870395","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Mingxin Zhang","raw_content_length":1700,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["IntroductionTimeouts","linear","ResultsTimeouts"],"persons":["Wilcoxon"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1700,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["momentum","The impact","timeout","basketball game","IntroductionTimeouts","coaches","an important means","a game","their impact","the games momentum"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"momentum":3.0,"The impact":2.0,"timeout":2.0,"basketball game":2.0,"IntroductionTimeouts":1.0,"coaches":1.0,"an important means":1.0,"a game":1.0,"their impact":1.0,"the games momentum":1.0}},"age_hours":6.779666221388888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8624,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0401,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0185,"anger":0.0347,"disgust":0.0317},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article analyzes the impact of timeouts on momentum in basketball games using data from 1,235 elite professional basketball games and 4,051 timeouts.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_e5e8f711ca39","title":"The influence of affective touch on interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory integration in infants: evidence from heartbeat","content":"IntroductionThe daily accumulation of multimodal interactions with a primary caregiver is thought to integrate interoceptive and exteroceptive information in the infant brain, which may contribute to the development of social cognition. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this integration in infancy remain largely unexplored. Focusing on affective touch as a sensory stimulus affecting infants' interoception during caregiver-infant interactions, this study examined how the perception of affective touch (i.e., stroking) affects the neural processing of interoceptive-exteroceptive integration in infants' brains.MethodsDuring the exposure phase, infants' legs were stroked while viewing a stranger's face (Affective Touch, AT), while another face was presented without touch as a control (No-Affective Touch, No-AT). In the test phase, infants viewed the same faces in isolation. Electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) were simultaneously measured to compare two neural indices between conditions in the test phase: heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs), reflecting interoceptive-exteroceptive integration, and event-related potentials (ERPs) to faces, indicating exteroceptive processing.ResultsResults showed that affective touch enhanced HEPs in frontal-central regions and modulated ERPs to faces, with stronger P400 amplitudes in parietal regions. In addition, a positive correlation between HEP responses and ERPs to faces emerged, with individual differences in resting HEP, reflecting baseline interoceptive-exteroceptive sensitivity, being associated with HEP modulation during the test phase.DiscussionThese findings suggest the role of multisensory experiences, particularly those involving touch, in enhancing interoceptive-exteroceptive integration, with individual variations. Our findings support the hypothesis that affective caregiver-infant interactions facilitate interoceptive-exteroceptive integration, a fundamental process underlying the development of social cognition, and emotional regulation.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1603183","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:20.870783","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Masako Myowa","raw_content_length":2044,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2044,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["affective touch","The influence","interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory integration","infants","evidence","heartbeat","IntroductionThe daily accumulation","multimodal interactions","a primary caregiver","interoceptive and exteroceptive information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["IntroductionThe daily accumulation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"affective touch":3.0,"The influence":2.0,"interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory integration":2.0,"infants":2.0,"evidence":2.0,"heartbeat":2.0,"IntroductionThe daily accumulation":1.0,"multimodal interactions":1.0,"a primary caregiver":1.0,"interoceptive and exteroceptive information":1.0}},"age_hours":6.779681181666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4946,"joy":0.0171,"surprise":0.0887,"sadness":0.0229,"fear":0.2595,"anger":0.0251,"disgust":0.092},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the neurological effects of affective touch on infants.

Data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, the Recurrence Risk Perception Scale for Stroke Patients (RRPS-SP), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), and the Health behavior Scale of Stroke Patient (HBS-SP) were included in this study.ResultThere were 266 valid questionnaires (95% effective recovery rate). In correlation analysis, high recurrence risk perception and high self-efficacy were significantly associated with better levels of health behavior (P < 0.05). In the multiple linear regression model, after controlling for sociodemographic variables and clinical characteristics information in the t/F test (P < 0.05), it was found that recurrence risk perception and self-efficacy were significant predictors of health behavior, and that exercise status, Course of Disease, and family history of stroke in the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information in the present study had a significant effect on health behavior (P < 0.05). Self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between recurrence risk perception and health behavior (95% CI 0.102 to 0.334), with the mediating effect accounting for 37.3% (0.202/0.541)of the total effect.ConclusionRecurrence risk perception and self-efficacy were influential factors in promoting health behavior.

{"id":"science_frontiers_psychology_90b46cd9d8a1","title":"Abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors under generational differences: a chain mediation model between perception of organizational politics and defensive silence","content":"Abusive supervision leads to employees' counterproductive work behaviors, which undermines an organization's sustainable development and survival. This study posits that the relationship between abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors varies across different age groups. Therefore, from the perspective of generational differences (Post-80s, Post-90s, Post-00s), we explored the mediating role of perceptions of organizational politics and defensive silence on abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors among 441 Chinese manufacturing employees by generation. The empirical analysis was conducted using Amos and SPSS statistical software. The results showed that abusive supervision significantly positively affected counterproductive work behaviors. Additionally, it finds that perceptions of organizational politics and defensive silence each serve as mediators in the relationship between abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors, forming a chained mediation effect. The study showed that the results differed among the Post-80s, Post-90s, and Post-00s groups. This suggests that generational differences have different perspectives on abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors. These results reveal the existence of a generational gap. The main contribution of this study lies in its identification of the chain mediating effects of perceptions of organizational politics and defensive silence between abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors from the perspective of generational differences for the first time. This enriches the research on generational differences, abusive supervision, and counterproductive work behaviors, providing new perspectives for future research endeavors.","source":"science_frontiers_psychology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1657730","published_date":"2025-10-13T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:20.872366","language":"en","tags":["original_research","open-access","psychology","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers in Psychology | New and Recent Articles","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Hann Earl Kim","raw_content_length":1767,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SPSS"],"persons":["Amos"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1767,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["generational differences","organizational politics","defensive silence","Abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors","a chain mediation model","perception","abusive supervision","Abusive supervision","employees counterproductive work behaviors","which"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a chain mediation model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"generational differences":3.0,"organizational politics":3.0,"defensive silence":3.0,"Abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors":2.0,"a chain mediation model":2.0,"perception":2.0,"abusive supervision":2.0,"Abusive supervision":1.0,"employees counterproductive work behaviors":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7797392725,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.28849999999999987,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9423,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1119,"joy":0.002,"surprise":0.0018,"sadness":0.0338,"fear":0.0146,"anger":0.251,"disgust":0.585},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study explores the relationship between abusive supervision and counterproductive work behaviors, which can indirectly impact an organization's sustainable development.
