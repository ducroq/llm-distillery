{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1ca225286d19","title":"Networks Multiscale Entropy Analysis","content":"arXiv:2510.11524v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding the structural complexity and predictability of complex networks is a central challenge in network science. Although recent studies have revealed a relationship between compression-based entropy and link prediction performance, existing methods focus on single-scale representations. This approach often overlooks the rich hierarchical patterns that can exist in real-world networks. In this study, we introduce a multiscale entropy framework that extends previous entropy-based approaches by applying spectral graph reduction. This allows us to quantify how structural entropy evolves as the network is gradually coarsened, capturing complexity across multiple scales. We apply our framework to real-world networks across biological, economic, social, technological, and transportation domains. The results uncover consistent entropy profiles across network families, revealing three structural regimes$\\unicode{x2013}$stable, increasing, and hybrid$\\unicode{x2013}$that align with domain-specific behaviors. Compared to single-scale models, multiscale entropy significantly improves our ability to determine network predictability. This shows that considering structural information across scales provides a more complete characterization of network complexity. Together, these results position multiscale entropy as a powerful and scalable tool for characterizing, classifying, and assessing the structure of complex networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11524","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.989974","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","cssi","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Sebasti\\'an Brzovic, Crist\\'obal Rojas, Andr\\'es Abeliuk","raw_content_length":1492,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Networks Multiscale Entropy Analysis arXiv:2510.11524v1 Announce Type: new Abstract"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1491,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Networks Multiscale Entropy Analysis","Announce Type","new Abstract","the structural complexity","predictability","complex networks","a central challenge","network science","recent studies","a relationship"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["network science"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Networks Multiscale Entropy Analysis":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the structural complexity":1.0,"predictability":1.0,"complex networks":1.0,"a central challenge":1.0,"network science":1.0,"recent studies":1.0,"a relationship":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7596241058333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7012,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0199,"sadness":0.0115,"fear":0.1135,"anger":0.0734,"disgust":0.0755},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel method for analyzing complex networks, showing improved predictability compared to single-scale models.

This paper develops a fourth-order AF method for one- and two-dimensional parabolic problems, employing the explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) method for time integration. The proposed method is built on a degenerate first-order system with auxiliary variables representing the derivatives of the primal variable, similar to local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods, which avoids introducing pseudo-time or performing iterations within a physical time step in the existing hyperbolic formulations. The evolution of cell averages follows the standard finite volume method, ensuring conservation, while the point values of both the primal and auxiliary variables are updated using fourth-order central finite difference operators. A discrete Fourier analysis confirms the fourth-order accuracy in 1D. With the third-order SSP-RK method, the maximum CFL number for stability is $0.27$ in 1D, as obtained by von Neumann analysis, larger than that of LDG methods. The proposed method is further applied to the porous medium equation, and positivity-preserving limitings are incorporated to guarantee the non-negativity of the numerical solutions. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and efficacy of the method.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11527","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.990777","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","csna","mathna","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Junming Duan","raw_content_length":1528,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Runge-Kutta","LDG"],"persons":["Galerkin","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":["fourth-order cent"]},"char_count":1527,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251011527v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The active flux","AF method","a compact high-order finite volume method","hyperbolic conservation laws","which","point values","cell interfaces","This paper"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251011527v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The active flux":1.0,"AF method":1.0,"a compact high-order finite volume method":1.0,"hyperbolic conservation laws":1.0,"which":1.0,"point values":1.0,"cell interfaces":1.0,"This paper":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7596533019444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6249,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8012,"joy":0.084,"surprise":0.0934,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0035,"anger":0.0097,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new numerical method for solving parabolic problems, including the porous medium equation, which could be relevant for modeling subsurface CO2 storage or groundwater flow.

This schism creates a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable, fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines.

It addresses a key gap by asking how AI reshapes cognitive processes and organizational norms, and how cultural values and institutional contexts shape AI adoption, trust, and use over time. We employ a three-wave longitudinal design that tracks AI knowledge, perceived competence, trust trajectories, and cultural responses. Participants span academic institutions and diverse firms, enabling contextual comparison. A dynamic sample continuous, intermittent, and wave-specific respondents mirrors real organizational variability and strengthens ecological validity. Methodologically, the study integrates quantitative longitudinal modeling with qualitative thematic analysis to capture temporal, structural, and cultural patterns in AI uptake. We trace AI acculturation through phases of initial resistance, exploratory adoption, and cultural embedding, revealing distinctive trust curves and problem-solving strategies by context: academic environments tend to collaborative, deliberative integration; business environments prioritize performance, speed, and measurable outcomes. Framing adoption as bidirectional challenges deterministic views: AI both reflects and reconfigures norms, decision-making, and cognitive engagement. As the first comparative longitudinal study of its kind, this work advances methodological rigor and offers actionable foundations for human-centred, culturally responsive AI strategies-supporting evidence-based policies, training, and governance that align cognitive performance, organizational goals, and ethical commitments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11530","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.991604","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscy","preprints","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Matthias Huemmer, Theophile Shyiramunda, Michelle J.

However, existing data-driven simulators face two key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset (CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions, particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets, enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling heterogeneous interactions.

However, most existing network control solutions target only average delay performance, falling short of providing strict End-to-End (E2E) peak latency guarantees. This paper addresses the challenge of reliably delivering packets within application-imposed deadlines by leveraging recent advancements in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL). After introducing the Delay-Constrained Maximum-Throughput (DCMT) dynamic network control problem, and highlighting the limitations of current solutions, we present a novel MA-DRL network control framework that leverages a centralized routing and distributed scheduling architecture. The proposed framework leverages critical networking domain knowledge for the design of effective MA-DRL strategies based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) technique, where centralized routing and distributed scheduling agents dynamically assign paths and schedule packet transmissions according to packet lifetimes, thereby maximizing on-time packet delivery. The generality of the proposed framework allows integrating both data-driven \\blue{Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)} agents and traditional rule-based policies in order to strike the right balance between performance and learning complexity. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed framework with respect to traditional stochastic optimization-based approaches and provide key insights into the role and interplay between data-driven DRL agents and new rule-based policies for both efficient and high-performance control of latency-critical services.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11535","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.992425","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csni","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Vincenzo Norman Vitale, Antonia Maria Tulino, Andreas F.

The proposed model constructs a fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19 domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for token-level classification models.

Recent observations reveal \\emph{Massive Activations} (MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is modulated by the input timestep embeddings.

However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the improvement can reach 33.8\\%.

Yet, it can be difficult to tune desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics, offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations. In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11542","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.994818","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Neil C.

Algorithmically, one can compute a single-linkage $k$-clustering (a partition into $k$ clusters) by computing a minimum spanning tree and dropping the $k-1$ most costly edges. This clustering minimizes the sum of spanning tree weights of the clusters. This motivates us to define the cost of a single-linkage $k$-clustering as the weight of the corresponding spanning forest, denoted by $\\mathrm{cost}_k$. Besides, if we consider single-linkage clustering as computing a hierarchy of clusterings, the total cost of the hierarchy is defined as the sum of the individual clusterings, denoted by $\\mathrm{cost}(G) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\mathrm{cost}_k$. In this paper, we assume that the distances between data points are given as a graph $G$ with average degree $d$ and edge weights from $\\{1,\\dots, W\\}$. Given query access to the adjacency list of $G$, we present a sampling-based algorithm that computes a succinct representation of estimates $\\widehat{\\mathrm{cost}}_k$ for all $k$. The running time is $\\tilde O(d\\sqrt{W}/\\varepsilon^3)$, and the estimates satisfy $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} |\\widehat{\\mathrm{cost}}_k - \\mathrm{cost}_k| \\le \\varepsilon\\cdot \\mathrm{cost}(G)$, for any $0<\\varepsilon <1$. Thus we can approximate the cost of every $k$-clustering upto $(1+\\varepsilon)$ factor \\emph{on average}. In particular, our result ensures that we can estimate $\\cost(G)$ upto a factor of $1\\pm \\varepsilon$ in the same running time. We also extend our results to the setting where edges represent similarities. In this case, the clusterings are defined by a maximum spanning tree, and our algorithms run in $\\tilde{O}(dW/\\varepsilon^3)$ time. We futher prove nearly matching lower bounds for estimating the total clustering cost and we extend our algorithms to metric space settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11547","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.995652","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":267,"author":"Pan Peng, Christian Sohler, Yi Xu","raw_content_length":1899,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.335,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Sublinear Algorithms","\\mathrm{cost}_k$.

To this end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11549","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.996041","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Liu Yang, Huiyu Duan, Ran Tao, Juntao Cheng, Sijing Wu, Yunhao Li, Jing Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Guangtao Zhai","raw_content_length":1389,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ODI","ODI arXiv:2510.11549v1 Announce Type","ODI-Bench"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1388,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ODI","ODIs","arXiv251011549v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Omnidirectional images","full 360x180 view","which","intelligence applications","multi-modal large language models","MLLMs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["multi-modal large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ODI":2.0,"ODIs":2.0,"arXiv251011549v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Omnidirectional images":1.0,"full 360x180 view":1.0,"which":1.0,"intelligence applications":1.0,"multi-modal large language models":1.0,"MLLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7598458527777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.531,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9062,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8381,"joy":0.0191,"surprise":0.1211,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0062,"anger":0.008,"disgust":0.0036},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a new benchmark and method for omnidirectional image understanding using MLLMs. While the technology could potentially improve applications in areas like embodied intelligence, its direct impact on climate change or sustainability is currently theoretical and unquantified.

One fundamental aspect of effective learning is relevant, immediate, and constructive feedback to students. Providing constructive feedback to large cohorts in academia is an ongoing challenge. Therefore, academics are moving towards automated assessment to provide immediate feedback. However, current approaches are often limited in scope, offering simplistic responses that do not provide students with personalized feedback to guide them toward improvements. This paper addresses this limitation by investigating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing students assessments with predefined rubrics and marking criteria to generate personalized feedback for in-depth learning. We aim to leverage the power of existing LLMs for Marking Assessments, Tracking, and Evaluation (LLM-MATE) with personalized feedback to enhance students learning. To evaluate the performance of LLM-MATE, we consider the Software Architecture (SA) module as a case study. The LLM-MATE approach can help module leaders overcome assessment challenges with large cohorts. Also, it helps students improve their learning by obtaining personalized feedback in a timely manner. Additionally, the proposed approach will facilitate the establishment of ground truth for automating the generation of students assessment feedback using the ChatGPT API, thereby reducing the overhead associated with large cohort assessments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11556","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.997756","language":"en","tags":["cscy","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Javed Ali Khan, Muhammad Yaqoob, Mamoona Tasadduq, Hafsa Shareef Dar, Aitezaz Ahsan","raw_content_length":1544,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models","Marking Assess"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1543,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Personalized and Constructive Feedback","Computer Science Students","the Large Language Model","LLM","arXiv251011556v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The evolving pedagogy paradigms","educational transformations","One fundamental aspect","effective learning"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Computer Science Students"],"ai_ml":["the Large Language Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Personalized and Constructive Feedback":2.0,"Computer Science Students":2.0,"the Large Language Model":2.0,"LLM":2.0,"arXiv251011556v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The evolving pedagogy paradigms":1.0,"educational transformations":1.0,"One fundamental aspect":1.0,"effective learning":1.0}},"age_hours":2.759904728888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8886,"joy":0.0403,"surprise":0.0238,"sadness":0.0037,"fear":0.0078,"anger":0.0245,"disgust":0.0114},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the use of LLMs for personalized feedback in computer science education.

We propose a critical framework connecting empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength) and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality), Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices (36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development, constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge. We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and democratizing access to AI benefits.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11557","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.998155","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Saurabh Khanna, Xinxu Li","raw_content_length":1450,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Invisible Giants","Digital Echoes"],"persons":["Strongholds"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1449,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Invisible Languages","the LLM Universe","arXiv251011557v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","massive multilingual corpora","this abundance masks","a profound crisis","the worlds 7613 living languages"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the LLM Universe","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Invisible Languages":2.0,"the LLM Universe":2.0,"arXiv251011557v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"massive multilingual corpora":1.0,"this abundance masks":1.0,"a profound crisis":1.0,"the worlds 7613 living languages":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7599201430555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5914,"joy":0.0156,"surprise":0.167,"sadness":0.0296,"fear":0.1468,"anger":0.0329,"disgust":0.0167},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies a significant problem of linguistic inequality in AI systems, which has implications for equitable access to AI benefits and perpetuates existing power structures.

This output modality stands in stark contrast to traditional web search, where results are returned as a ranked list of independent web pages. In this paper, we ask: Along what dimensions do generative search outputs differ from traditional web search? We compare Google, a traditional web search engine, with four generative search engines from two providers (Google and OpenAI) across queries from four domains. Our analysis reveals intriguing differences. Most generative search engines cover a wider range of sources compared to web search. Generative search engines vary in the degree to which they rely on internal knowledge contained within the model parameters v.s. external knowledge retrieved from the web. Generative search engines surface varying sets of concepts, creating new opportunities for enhancing search diversity and serendipity.

However, current approaches are typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts). Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer, resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these limitations, we present \\textbf{SNAP} (\\textbf{S}egment a\\textbf{N}ything in \\textbf{A}ny \\textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries, enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_67f23281c912","title":"SCOOP'D: Learning Mixed","content":"arXiv:2510.11566v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life, ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions. Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input.

This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance. Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6a297acef6e7","title":"Bag of Tricks for Subverting Reasoning","content":"arXiv:2510.11570v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent reasoning-based safety guardrails for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as deliberative alignment, have shown strong defense against jailbreak attacks. By leveraging LRMs' reasoning ability, these guardrails help the models to assess the safety of user inputs before generating final responses. The powerful reasoning ability can analyze the intention of the input query and will refuse to assist once it detects the harmful intent hidden by the jailbreak methods. Such guardrails have shown a significant boost in defense, such as the near-perfect refusal rates on the open-source gpt-oss series. Unfortunately, we find that these powerful reasoning-based guardrails can be extremely vulnerable to subtle manipulation of the input prompts, and once hijacked, can lead to even more harmful results. Specifically, we first uncover a surprisingly fragile aspect of these guardrails: simply adding a few template tokens to the input prompt can successfully bypass the seemingly powerful guardrails and lead to explicit and harmful responses. To explore further, we introduce a bag of jailbreak methods that subvert the reasoning-based guardrails. Our attacks span white-, gray-, and black-box settings and range from effortless template manipulations to fully automated optimization. Along with the potential for scalable implementation, these methods also achieve alarmingly high attack success rates (e.g., exceeding 90% across 5 different benchmarks on gpt-oss series on both local host models and online API services). Evaluations across various leading open-source LRMs confirm that these vulnerabilities are systemic, underscoring the urgent need for stronger alignment techniques for open-sourced LRMs to prevent malicious misuse.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_07c67402c0f8","title":"(Dis)Proving Spectre Security with Speculation","content":"arXiv:2510.11573v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Constant-time (CT) verification tools are commonly used for detecting potential side-channel vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries. Recently, a new class of tools, called speculative constant-time (SCT) tools, has also been used for detecting potential Spectre vulnerabilities. In many cases, these SCT tools have emerged as liftings of CT tools. However, these liftings are seldom defined precisely and are almost never analyzed formally. The goal of this paper is to address this gap, by developing formal foundations for these liftings, and to demonstrate that these foundations can yield practical benefits. Concretely, we introduce a program transformation, coined Speculation-Passing Style (SPS), for reducing SCT verification to CT verification. Essentially, the transformation instruments the program with a new input that corresponds to attacker-controlled predictions and modifies the program to follow them. This approach is sound and complete, in the sense that a program is SCT if and only if its SPS transform is CT. Thus, we can leverage existing CT verification tools to prove SCT; we illustrate this by combining SPS with three standard methodologies for CT verification, namely reducing it to non-interference, assertion safety and dynamic taint analysis. We realize these combinations with three existing tools, EasyCrypt, BINSEC, and ctgrind, and we evaluate them on Kocher's benchmarks for Spectre-v1. Our results focus on Spectre-v1 in the standard CT leakage model; however, we also discuss applications of our method to other variants of Spectre and other leakage models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11573","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.001805","language":"en","tags":["research","cspl","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":239,"author":"Santiago Arranz-Olmos, Gilles Barthe, Lionel Blatter, Xingyu Xie, Zhiyuan Zhang","raw_content_length":1651,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.195,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SCT","Speculation-Passing Style","SPS"],"persons":["Spectre"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1648,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Spectre Security","Speculation","new Abstract","Constant-time CT verification tools","potential side-channel vulnerabilities","cryptographic libraries","a new class","tools","speculative constant-time SCT tools","potential Spectre vulnerabilities"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Spectre Security":2.0,"Speculation":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Constant-time CT verification tools":1.0,"potential side-channel vulnerabilities":1.0,"cryptographic libraries":1.0,"a new class":1.0,"tools":1.0,"speculative constant-time SCT tools":1.0,"potential Spectre vulnerabilities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760051585277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7279,"joy":0.0141,"surprise":0.0507,"sadness":0.0096,"fear":0.1753,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a program transformation to improve the detection of Spectre vulnerabilities.

To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy, retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability, requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms of different type and weight classes.

A recent black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters, which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies further validate its capability to generate explanations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11584","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.003797","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Ting Li, Yang Yang, Yipeng Yu, Liang Yao, Guoqing Chao, Ruifeng Xu","raw_content_length":1697,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KGE","LLM"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1696,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Large Language Models","Explainable Attackers","Knowledge Graph Embeddings","arXiv251011584v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Adversarial attacks","knowledge graph embeddings","KGE","the models ability","link prediction"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Large Language Models":2.0,"Explainable Attackers":2.0,"Knowledge Graph Embeddings":2.0,"arXiv251011584v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Adversarial attacks":1.0,"knowledge graph embeddings":1.0,"KGE":1.0,"the models ability":1.0,"link prediction":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7601256738888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.40700000000000014,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9186,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2366,"joy":0.0026,"surprise":0.0096,"sadness":0.0365,"fear":0.2322,"anger":0.3669,"disgust":0.1156},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel LLM-based framework (LLMAtKGE) to improve the robustness of knowledge graph embeddings against adversarial attacks.

As requirements grow, these documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11588","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.004599","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":226,"author":"Jiateng Liu, Zhenhailong Wang, Xiaojiang Huang, Yingjie Li, Xing Fan, Xiang Li, Chenlei Guo, Ruhi Sarikaya, Heng Ji","raw_content_length":1797,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.13,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Controllable Complexity","Analyzing and Internalizing Complex Policy Documents for LLM Agents arXiv:2510.11588v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","CC-Gen"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1796,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Complex Policy Documents","LLM Agents","arXiv251011588v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Model","LLM-based agentic systems","context","diverse business rules","requirements","these documents"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Agents","Large Language Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Complex Policy Documents":2.0,"LLM Agents":2.0,"arXiv251011588v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Model":1.0,"LLM-based agentic systems":1.0,"context":1.0,"diverse business rules":1.0,"requirements":1.0,"these documents":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7601544927777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8275,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1655,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9297,"joy":0.0079,"surprise":0.0337,"sadness":0.0089,"fear":0.0038,"anger":0.0099,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method (CAP-CPT) to improve the ability of LLMs to internalize complex policy documents, reducing prompt length by 97.3% on CC-Gen and improving performance on Qwen-3-32B by up to 41% and 22%.

QDER's key innovation lies in its modeling of query-document relationships: rather than computing similarity scores on aggregated embeddings, we maintain individual token and entity representations throughout the ranking process, performing aggregation only at the final scoring stage - an approach we call \"late aggregation.\" We first transform these fine-grained representations through learned attention patterns, then apply carefully chosen mathematical operations for precise matches. Experiments across five standard benchmarks show that QDER achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of 36% in nDCG@20 over the strongest baseline on TREC Robust 2004 and similar improvements on other datasets.

The fundamental issue is not computational--it is intelligent content selection: identifying what matters in lengthy, multi-faceted texts. While humans naturally anchor their understanding around key entities and concepts, neural models process text within rigid token windows, treating all interactions as equally important and missing critical semantic signals. We introduce REGENT, a neural re-ranking model that mimics human-like understanding by using entities as a \"semantic skeleton\" to guide attention. REGENT integrates relevance guidance directly into the attention mechanism, combining fine-grained lexical matching with high-level semantic reasoning. This relevance-guided attention enables the model to focus on conceptually important content while maintaining sensitivity to precise term matches. REGENT achieves new state-of-the-art performance in three challenging datasets, providing up to 108% improvement over BM25 and consistently outperforming strong baselines including ColBERT and RankVicuna.

However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

While highly effective in single-task settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset, enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage, the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly less task-specific data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11598","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.006951","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Bo Cheng, Xu Wang, Jinda Liu, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu","raw_content_length":1206,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LoRA","MeTA-LoRA"],"persons":["arXiv:2510.11598v1 Announce"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1205,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MeTA-LoRA","Data-Efficient Multi","arXiv251011598v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Low-Rank Adaptation","LoRA","large language models","LLMs","tasks","single-task settings"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MeTA-LoRA":2.0,"Data-Efficient Multi":2.0,"arXiv251011598v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Low-Rank Adaptation":1.0,"LoRA":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"single-task settings":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7602443083333337,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.9205,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7841,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8197,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0411,"sadness":0.0523,"fear":0.0239,"anger":0.032,"disgust":0.0265},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel machine learning technique (MeTA-LoRA) that improves data efficiency in multi-task adaptation for large language models.

These embeddings capture distinct, individually specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space. We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability in user-centric settings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11599","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.007332","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","preprints","research","cscl","csir","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"Marc Brinner, Sina Zarrie{\\ss}","raw_content_length":1204,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.76,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1203,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251011599v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","SemCSE-Multi","a novel unsupervised framework","multifaceted embeddings","scientific abstracts","the domains","invasion biology","medicine","These embeddings"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the domains"],"healthcare_tech":["medicine"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251011599v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"SemCSE-Multi":1.0,"a novel unsupervised framework":1.0,"multifaceted embeddings":1.0,"scientific abstracts":1.0,"the domains":1.0,"invasion biology":1.0,"medicine":1.0,"These embeddings":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7602581263888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8304,"joy":0.0597,"surprise":0.0718,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.01,"anger":0.0174,"disgust":0.0056},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework for generating multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts.

However, the necessity of each of these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11602","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.007740","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Huiyin Xue, Nafise Sadat Moosavi, Nikolaos Aletras","raw_content_length":1480,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1479,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Attention","Design Principles","Effective Language Modeling","arXiv251011602v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The success","Transformer language models","their dot-product attention mechanism","which","a set"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Attention":2.0,"Design Principles":2.0,"Effective Language Modeling":2.0,"arXiv251011602v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The success":1.0,"Transformer language models":1.0,"their dot-product attention mechanism":1.0,"which":1.0,"a set":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760273284722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.259500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8519,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7928,"joy":0.0468,"surprise":0.0301,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0652,"anger":0.0448,"disgust":0.015},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the design principles of attention mechanisms in language models, aiming to simplify them without sacrificing performance.

After mere minutes of scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness while keeping the computational footprint attractive.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11605","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.008515","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Leonard Bruns, Axel Barroso-Laguna, Tommaso Cavallari, \\'Aron Monszpart, Sowmya Munukutla, Victor Adrian Prisacariu, Eric Brachmann","raw_content_length":1328,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ACE arXiv:2510.11605v1 Announce Type","SCR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1327,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ACE","query images","arXiv251011605v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Scene coordinate regression","SCR","itself","a promising learning-based approach","visual relocalization","mere minutes"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["ACE"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ACE":2.0,"query images":2.0,"arXiv251011605v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Scene coordinate regression":1.0,"SCR":1.0,"itself":1.0,"a promising learning-based approach":1.0,"visual relocalization":1.0,"mere minutes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7603026155555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8985,"joy":0.0103,"surprise":0.0587,"sadness":0.0116,"fear":0.0059,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a new method for visual relocalization (ACE-G) that improves robustness compared to previous methods.

However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning.

Our Attention Factors are conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S. equities over a 24-year period.

Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency, addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11618","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.011252","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csma","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Zehao Chen, Rong Pan, Haoran Li","raw_content_length":1273,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1272,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["StoryBox","Collaborative Multi-Agent Simulation","Hybrid Bottom","arXiv251011618v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Human writers","their stories","an overarching mental scene","the interactions","characters"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"StoryBox":2.0,"Collaborative Multi-Agent Simulation":2.0,"Hybrid Bottom":2.0,"arXiv251011618v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Human writers":1.0,"their stories":1.0,"an overarching mental scene":1.0,"the interactions":1.0,"characters":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760402676388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.375,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.875,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8985,"joy":0.0391,"surprise":0.0368,"sadness":0.0027,"fear":0.0065,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel approach to story generation using multi-agent simulations.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_06e7eef22b4a","title":"Enhancing Long Chain-of","content":"arXiv:2510.11620v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model (LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11620","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.011692","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":263,"author":"Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Faramarz Fekri","raw_content_length":1862,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.315,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CoT","Multi-Path Plan Aggregation"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1861,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Long Chain","Announce Type","new Abstract","Inference-time scaling","the reasoning ability","a language model","thought","existing approaches","the entire reasoning chain","a single forward pass"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Long Chain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Long Chain":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Inference-time scaling":1.0,"the reasoning ability":1.0,"a language model":1.0,"thought":1.0,"existing approaches":1.0,"the entire reasoning chain":1.0,"a single forward pass":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760418038888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.0420000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7916,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3129,"joy":0.0028,"surprise":0.0207,"sadness":0.291,"fear":0.0605,"anger":0.2029,"disgust":0.1092},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (MPPA) for improving the reasoning ability of language models, which could potentially be applied to optimize various sustainability-related processes.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_34ac2706c010","title":"NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector","content":"arXiv:2510.11632v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1c5d21d6f797","title":"LRQ-Solver: A Transformer","content":"arXiv:2510.11636v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Solving large-scale Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on complex three-dimensional geometries represents a central challenge in scientific and engineering computing, often impeded by expensive pre-processing stages and substantial computational overhead. We introduce Low-Rank Query-based PDE Solver (LRQ-Solver), a physics-integrated framework engineered for rapid, accurate, and highly scalable simulations of industrial-grade models. This framework is built upon two primary technical innovations. First, our Parameter Conditioned Lagrangian Modeling (PCLM) approach explicitly couples local physical states with global design parameters, enabling robust predictions across varied simulation configurations. By embedding physical consistency directly into the learning architecture, PCLM ensures that predictions remain physically meaningful even under unseen design conditions, significantly enhancing generalization and reliability. Second, the Low-Rank Query Attention (LR-QA) module leverages the second-order statistics of physical fields to construct a global coherence kernel, reducing the computational complexity of attention from O(N2) to O(NC2 + C3). By replacing point-wise clustering with covariance decomposition, LRQ-Solver achieves exceptional scalability efficiently processing up to 2 million points on a single GPU. Validated on standard benchmarks, LRQ-Solver achieves a 38.9% error reduction on the DrivAer++ dataset and 28.76% on the 3D Beam dataset, alongside a training speedup of up to 50 times. Our results establish that LRQ-Solver offers a powerful paradigm for multi-configuration physics simulations, delivering a SOTA combination of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.

Our main result is the first continual release DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP algorithms and the space complexity of the best non-private streaming algorithms, up to constants. The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that simultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection not previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the static setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\\log n)$ additive error and $O(n\\log n)$ space, improving both accuracy and space complexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce graph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier subsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space incurred by prior work [ELMZ25]. We believe this simple idea may be of independent interest.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11640","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:39.014616","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csds","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Felix Zhou","raw_content_length":1137,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DSG"],"persons":["O(\\log","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1136,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Continual Release","Densest Subgraphs","Privacy Amplification","Sublinear Space","Subsampling","new Abstract","the sublinear space continual release model","a focus","the densest subgraph problem","DSG"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Continual Release":2.0,"Densest Subgraphs":2.0,"Privacy Amplification":2.0,"Sublinear Space":2.0,"Subsampling":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the sublinear space continual release model":1.0,"a focus":1.0,"the densest subgraph problem":1.0,"DSG":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760525383888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.062000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6124,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8976,"joy":0.0212,"surprise":0.051,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0057,"anger":0.0112,"disgust":0.008},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for privacy-preserving graph analysis, specifically for identifying dense subgraphs.

Despite their success, existing AR-based zero-shot TTS systems face two critical limitations: (i) an inherent speed-quality trade-off, as sequential token generation either reduces frame rates at the cost of expressiveness or enriches tokens at the cost of efficiency, and (ii) a text-oriented supervision mismatch, as cross-entropy loss penalizes token errors uniformly without considering the fine-grained acoustic similarity among adjacent tokens. To address these challenges, we propose BridgeTTS, a novel AR-TTS framework built upon the dual speech representation paradigm BridgeCode. BridgeTTS reduces AR iterations by predicting sparse tokens while reconstructing rich continuous features for high-quality synthesis. Joint optimization of token-level and feature-level objectives further enhances naturalness and intelligibility. Experiments demonstrate that BridgeTTS achieves competitive quality and speaker similarity while significantly accelerating synthesis.
