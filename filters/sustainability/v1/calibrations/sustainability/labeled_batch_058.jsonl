{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_4a89a599073c","title":"Meer dan twintig wereldleiders naar Egypte voor vredestop Gaza","content":"Meer dan twintig wereldleiders zullen morgen samenkomen in Egypte voor een vredestop over Gaza. De top zal worden voorgezeten door de Egyptische president Sisi en de Amerikaanse president Trump. \"De top heeft als doel een einde te maken aan de oorlog in Gaza en moet een nieuw tijdperk van regionale veiligheid en stabiliteit inluiden in het Midden-Oosten\", schreef de Egyptische president. Wie er precies aanschuiven bij de top is nog niet bekend. Onder meer de Franse president Macron, de Britse premier Starmer, en secretaris-generaal van de Verenigde Naties Guterres hebben aangekondigd af te reizen naar de Egyptische badplaats voor de top. Ook de Italiaanse premier Meloni en de Spaanse premier Sanchez hebben hun aanwezigheid bevestigd. Volgens de Amerikaanse nieuwssite Axios zal Israël niet deelnemen aan de top. Hamas zelf heeft ook laten weten niet betrokken te zijn bij de top. Akkoord over eerste fase Donderdagnacht werd bekend dat Israël en Hamas tot een akkoord waren gekomen over de eerste fase van een plan om de oorlog te stoppen. De laatste gijzelaars die worden vastgehouden in de Gazastrook zouden worden vrijgelaten in ruil voor Palestijnen die vastzitten in Israëlische gevangenissen. Ook moet het Israëlische leger beginnen met het terugtrekken uit het gebied. Afgesproken werd dat voor maandag 12.00 uur lokale tijd de twintig gijzelaars die nog in leven zijn moeten zijn vrijgelaten. Volgens het akkoord moet Israël honderden Palestijnen die vastzitten in Israëlische gevangenissen vrijlaten. Dit is het plan dat de Amerikaanse president Trump heeft voorgesteld voor Gaza: Nadat vrijdag het staakt-het-vuren officieel inging, zijn veel Palestijnen weer richting het noorden van de Gazastrook getrokken. De kustweg was deze week afgesloten door het Israëlische leger. Ook naar andere gebieden waar het Israëlische leger zich weer uit heeft teruggetrokken keren de Palestijnen terug naar hun huizen. Vaak is daar inmiddels weinig van over. \"Alles is plat. Uitgewist. Ze hebben het helemaal uitgewist\", zegt een vrouw die terugkeerde. In de video hieronder vertellen Palestijnen over wat ze aantroffen bij hun terugkeer:","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586146","published_date":"2025-10-11T23:23:12","collected_date":"2025-10-12T01:51:32.367255","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":328,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2497,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.64,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Axios","Egypte voor vredestop Gaza Meer","Midden-Oosten"],"persons":["Trump","Starmer"],"locations":["Meloni","Israël","Verenigde Naties Guterres","Gaza"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2144,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["wereldleiders","vredestop","De top","de Egyptische president","een vredestop","Gaza","de Amerikaanse president","doel","een einde","de oorlog"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"wereldleiders":3.0,"vredestop":2.0,"De top":2.0,"de Egyptische president":2.0,"een vredestop":1.0,"Gaza":1.0,"de Amerikaanse president":1.0,"doel":1.0,"een einde":1.0,"de oorlog":1.0}},"age_hours":2.572391013888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7272,"joy":0.0144,"surprise":0.0972,"sadness":0.0367,"fear":0.047,"anger":0.0384,"disgust":0.0392},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":4,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a peace summit and an agreement between Israel and Hamas involving the release of hostages and prisoners.

Door aanhoudende regen waren er op verschillende plekken aardverschuivingen en overstromingen. In de deelstaat Hidalgo, boven Mexico-Stad, kwamen 22 mensen om het leven. In delen van de stad viel de stroom uit. In de deelstaat Puebla kwamen negen mensen om het leven en raakten meer dan 16.000 huizen beschadigd of verwoest. Een dierentuin in Xicotepec liep ernstige schade op door het noodweer. Dieren moesten uit hun verblijf worden gehaald en daarbij ontsnapte een witte Bengaalse tijger. De tijger werd een dag later dood gevonden onder een omgevallen boom, meldde de burgemeester op Facebook. In het oosten van Mexico dreven voertuigen door de straten: In de centrale deelstaat Querétaro werd een zesjarig kind bedolven onder rotsen en modder bij een aardverschuiving. In het oosten van het land, in de deelstaat Veracruz, trad de rivier Cazones buiten haar oevers. In die staat vielen ook zeker vijf doden.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_81404dc607bf","title":"Trump start met ontslagen tijdens shutdown: opnieuw duizenden ambtenaren op straat","content":"Op dag 10 van de shutdown doet de Trump-regering waar het de afgelopen weken al veelvuldig mee dreigde. \"De ontslagen zijn begonnen\", schreef directeur Russel Vought van het Budget Office kort voor het weekend in een korte boodschap op X. Opnieuw worden duizenden Amerikaanse ambtenaren op straat gezet. Niemand weet meer waar die aan toe is. \"In april ben ik al eens ontslagen, na een maand werd ik toch weer teruggehaald\", zegt Travis Kinder, die voor het ministerie van Gezondheidszorg werkt. De ambtenaar doet onderzoek naar auto-immuunziekten. \"Nu staat mijn carrière weer op het spel. Terwijl de overheid op slot zit, staan de aandoeningen van onze patiënten niet stil\", zegt hij. Anderen werden al eerder op straat gezet. \"Ik ben in juli ontslagen\", zegt Michael Duffin. Hij werkte voor het Amerikaanse Bureau of Counterterrorism, dat zich bezighield met internationale samenwerking om terrorisme te bestrijden, ook samen met Nederland. \"Ze geloofden niet dat het paste in het America First-buitenlandbeleid van de Trump-regering.\" 'Ambtenaren als gijzelaars' Trump wil het ambtenarenbestand dit jaar met 300.000 mensen terugdringen. De ontslagen van vrijdagavond komen daar bovenop. Bij onder meer het ministerie van Financiën en het Gezondheidsministerie verdwijnen meer dan 4000 banen. \"Een bullebak die zich bezighoudt met chantage\", noemt de Democratische senator Elizabeth Warren de Amerikaanse president, die eerder zelf al zei de shutdown te gebruiken om meer ambtenaren te ontslaan. \"De president van de Verenigde Staten die om politieke redenen zoveel mogelijk pijn wil toebrengen aan duizenden mensen, wiens enige 'zonde' is dat ze hun werk doen\", zegt Warren, bij de trappen van de Senaat. \"De rechtbanken hebben al geconcludeerd dat meerdere ontslagen illegaal zijn\", valt collega-senator Chris Van Hollen haar bij. \"Ontslagen tijdens de shutdown zijn dat ook\", stelt hij. Van Hollen vertegenwoordigt het nabijgelegen Maryland, waar zo'n 225.000 federale ambtenaren wonen. Ook hij vindt dat Trump de ontslagen gebruikt als pressiemiddel. \"Alsof ze ambtenaren gebruiken als gijzelaars. Het is hypocriet: hij wil de overheid openhouden om diensten te kunnen verlenen. Maar de mensen die die diensten leveren, wil hij ontslaan.\" Militairen wel betaald Democraten en Republikeinen zijn verwikkeld in een impasse over de begroting van het nieuwe boekjaar, dat 1 oktober is ingegaan. Zonder akkoord in het Congres mag de overheid alleen geld uitgeven aan 'essentiële overheidsdiensten'. Of ze nou doorwerken, of thuiszitten: betaald krijgen de ambtenaren voorlopig niet. Wel zegt Trump inmiddels geld te hebben gevonden om militairen hun salaris te kunnen betalen. Ondanks hun meerderheid hebben de Republikeinen in de Senaat nog een handvol Democraten nodig om hun begroting door te drukken. De Democraten zetten hun hakken in het zand en eisen dat subsidies voor zorgverzekeringen worden voortgezet. \"Wij zullen blijven vechten\", zegt Warren, gevraagd of zij buigt voor de druk van Trump. \"Het is een strijd voor de tientallen miljoenen Amerikanen, zodat zij op 1 november niet wakker worden en zien dat hun zorgpremie is verdubbeld.\" \"We werken er hard aan de overheid weer te heropenen, en te zorgen dat jullie betaald krijgen\", roept de Republikeinse senator Susan Collins nog, in de gangen van het Capitool tegen een groep ambtenaren. Meer wil ze niet zeggen, ook niet over de ontslagen. \"We verdienen zoveel beter dan dit, maar ze loopt gewoon door\", zegt ambtenaar Stephi. \"Het is laf, ze laten ons in de steek.\" Vliegverkeer vertraagd Inmiddels beginnen de effecten van de shutdown door te sijpelen tot ver buiten de muren van het Capitool. Op meerdere plekken hebben luchtverkeersleiders, die niet betaald krijgen tijdens de shutdown, zich ziekgemeld. Daardoor kampt het vliegverkeer met meer vertragingen. Vanaf zondag sluiten de 'Smithsonians', de nationale musea in de hoofdstad, hun deuren tot nader order. Ondertussen is de blame game in volle gang: Trump noemt de shutdown steevast de 'Schumer Shutdown', naar de leider van de Democraten in de Senaat. De Democraten op hun beurt wijzen naar Trump, en de Republikeinse Partij. Amerikanen zijn verdeeld over de schuldvraag. De vraag is wie als eerste met de ogen knippert in deze staredown: Trump en zijn Republikeinen, of toch de Democraten? \"Er is niks om over te onderhandelen\", zei leider John Thune van de Republikeinse Partij eerder op een persconferentie. Toch blijft dat waar de Democraten op mikken. \"De Republikeinen zullen moeten gaan onderhandelen, de president moet praten\", zegt senator Van Hollen vastberaden.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586133","published_date":"2025-10-11T20:16:48","collected_date":"2025-10-12T01:51:32.369379","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":707,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4939,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.535,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Trump","Travis Kinder","Counterterrorism","Niemand","Michael Duffin"],"locations":["Russel"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4602,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["straat","shutdown","ambtenaren","die","dag","de shutdown","de Trump-regering","het","de afgelopen weken","directeur"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"straat":3.0,"shutdown":2.0,"ambtenaren":2.0,"die":2.0,"dag":1.0,"de shutdown":1.0,"de Trump-regering":1.0,"het":1.0,"de afgelopen weken":1.0,"directeur":1.0}},"age_hours":5.679088138888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7169,"joy":0.0103,"surprise":0.1252,"sadness":0.0473,"fear":0.0505,"anger":0.0278,"disgust":0.022},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":4,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a government shutdown leading to the potential loss of jobs for 300,000 government employees, including those working in health and counterterrorism.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_0b1eb77c5fe4","title":"60 jaar 3FM: eigenwijs, dj's als vrienden en kansen voor talenten","content":"Precies zestig jaar geleden was de eerste uitzending op, toen nog, Hilversum 3. De eerste plaat was Fanfare Rock van de Duitse trompettist Horst Fischer. Cultuurminister Vrolijk gaf het startschot met de woorden: \"Ik wens u toe dat u er veel genoegen aan zult beleven\". Ooit Hilversum 3 en Radio 3, maar tegenwoordig bekend als 3FM. De zender groeide uit tot een van de populairste Nederlandse radiostations. De luistercijfers zijn al een hele tijd niet meer zo hoog als vroeger, maar dat weerhoudt het radiostation er niet van om dit weekend het jubileum uitgebreid te vieren. Beeld en Geluid in Hilversum is de feestlocatie en is gratis te bezoeken. 3FM maakt daar vandaag en morgen live radio. Ook is er een speciale tentoonstelling over de afgelopen zestig jaar en allerlei activiteiten, zoals een eigen radio bouwen of jingle maken. Eigenwijs Presentator Nellie Benner omschrijft 3FM als \"eigenwijs\" en \"een warm bad\". Met Barend van Deelen presenteert ze de 3FM-middagshow Barend & Benner. Voor haar betekent 3FM plezier, warmte en muziek. \"En vooral ook veel lachen.\" Ze vindt het een gemoedelijke en samenhorige zender. \"Er zijn veel luisteraars die al tientallen jaren luisteren, maar ook heel veel jonge luisteraars. We richten ons wel vooral op jongeren, maar eigenlijk op iedereen die nieuwsgierig is en die het leuk vindt om lol te trappen.\" 'Het zijn mijn vrienden' 3FM-fans Peter (43), Daan (22) en Mans (33) prijzen de \"lekkere muziek\". Mans luistert graag naar dj's Ivo van Breukelen en Van Deelen. \"Ze zijn een soort vrienden\", zegt Mans. \"Ik zet de radio aan en ik ben niet alleen meer. Ze fleuren de huiskamer op.\" Daar is Peter het mee eens. \"Met 3FM ga ik positief de dag in en ontdek ik mooie nieuwe talenten.\" Daan vindt Barend & Benner \"de allerleukste middagshow ooit\". Hij houdt van de chemie tussen de presentatoren en hun baldadigheid. 'Hobby en passie' Ter ere van het jubileum staan in het Beeld en Geluid allerlei oude mengtafels. Zo staat er een dj-tafel uit de jaren 70. Radio-iconen als Lex Harding maakten daar programma's toen ze bij de zender werkten. Vanmiddag nam bezoeker Marjolein (26) er plaats. Ze start platen en jingles in alsof ze het al jaren doet. \"Deze tafel is een stuk overzichtelijker dan die van nu\", zegt Marjolein. \"Radio is mijn hobby en passie.\" Het lijkt haar heel leuk om er ooit haar werk van te maken. \"Het leuke is dat alles het nog doet\", legt vrijwilliger Melchior uit. \"En alles is nog origineel.\" Hij kan het niet laten om zelf ook even achter de dj-tafel te gaan zitten. \"Ik zit echt te genieten.\" Zijn vader was vroeger geluidstechnicus en hijzelf ook. Van vader en zoon staat een zwart-wit foto bij een oude eindregietafel. \"We zitten allebei op het puntje van onze stoel\", constateert Melchior: De rol van 3FM is na al die jaren nog steeds dezelfde, zegt zendermanager Menno de Boer. \"We bieden talent kansen en zijn een gids in nieuwe muziek en popcultuur.\" Waar andere radiozenders zich meer richten op een brede doelgroep, doet 3FM dat niet. \"We blijven trouw aan onszelf.\" De zender wil zich meer focussen op jongeren. \"We willen weer mensen onder de 35 jaar aan ons binden. Dat gaat nu goed.\" Het gaat niet heel snel, erkent De Boer, \"maar we bouwen gestaag door\". Dit weekend zijn ook oud-dj's van de partij. Zo vertellen dj's Gerard Ekdom, Felix Meurders en Edvard Niessing over hun tijd bij de zender. Vandaag kwam bijvoorbeeld Jan Douwe Kroeske aan het woord, onder meer bekend van het programma 2 Meter Sessies. Kroeske ontvangt daarin al bijna 40 jaar artiesten voor een intiem akoestisch optreden en een interview. Kroeske vertelt dat hij nieuwe muziek vroeger ook al heel belangrijk vond. \"Ik was meer bezig met muziek dan met radio maken\", zegt hij. \"Ik wilde luisteraars kennis laten maken met nieuwe muziek, want ik was zelf ook nieuwsgierig naar dingen die ik niet kende.\" Nieuwe muziek speelt natuurlijk ook een rol in het jubileumweekend. Vanmiddag stond 3FM Talent Luna op het podium in het museum. Het publiek zong en danste vrolijk mee. Morgen wordt er nog volop feestgevierd in het Beeld en Geluid. Dan treedt een ander talent op: Lenny Monsou. In die 60 jaar was er ook altijd nieuws te horen op 3FM. Sinds het begin van deze eeuw met speciale bulletins van de NOS.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_b068ae52c24f","title":"Rechter stelt voorwaarden aan staking sjorders Rotterdamse haven","content":"De staking bij twee sjordersbedrijven in de Rotterdamse haven mag nog doorgaan tot maandagochtend 07.00 uur. Daarna moeten de sjorders het werk hervatten tot aanstaande vrijdag 07.00 uur. Als de partijen in het cao-conflict er dan nog niet uit zijn, mag de staking worden hervat. Dat is de voorlopige uitkomst van een kort geding dat was aangespannen door een groep ondernemers, waaronder het Havenbedrijf Rotterdam. Deltalinqs, de vertegenwoordiger van Rotterdamse havenbedrijven sprak gisteren over grote maatschappelijke schade als het werk nog langer werd stilgelegd. Vakbond FNV spreekt van een prima tussenvonnis. De havenbedrijven en vertegenwoordigers vinden het geen ideale oplossing, maar zeggen dat op deze manier de achterstanden min of meer kunnen worden weggewerkt. \"Wij blijven van mening dat de actie op dit moment onevenredige schade veroorzaakt en de leveringszekerheid ernstig onder druk zet.\" De sjorders die de containers in de haven vastzetten en losmaken, staken sinds woensdag. Vakbond FNV, die de staking organiseert, eiste een loonsverhoging van 7 procent. Vrijdag werd dat bijgesteld naar 6,5 procent. De werkgevers International Lashing Service en Matrans Marine Services, de enige twee sjordersbedrijven in de Rotterdamse haven, wilden daar niet mee akkoord gaan. Daarop besloten de actievoerders voor onbepaalde tijd verder te staken. Veel schepen kunnen daardoor niet lossen of laden. Volgens het Havenbedrijf Rotterdam liggen op dit moment 22 containerschepen in de haven en per dag komen er vier tot vijf bij. In de containers zit voor ongeveer een kwart aan voedsel waaronder veel bederfelijke producten, maar ook halffabricaten, medische en huishoudelijke producten, machineonderdelen en grondstoffen. Calamiteitenteam Op de zitting zei een van de advocaten van vakbond FNV dat er geen levens gevaar lopen door de staking. \"Als er sprake zou zijn van bijvoorbeeld medicijntekorten dan is er een calamiteitenteam van sjorders die de werkzaamheden zou kunnen voortzetten.\" Het komt voor dat schepen bij dit soort stakingen uitwijken naar andere havens zoals die van Hamburg of Antwerpen. Maar volgens de advocaten van de groep ondernemers is dat logistiek nu niet haalbaar. Ook in de haven van Antwerpen wordt nog gestaakt.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586130","published_date":"2025-10-11T19:28:18","collected_date":"2025-10-12T01:51:32.372604","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":338,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2497,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.69,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FNV"],"persons":[],"locations":["Havenbedrijf Rotterdam","Deltalinqs"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2256,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Rechter","voorwaarden","staking","sjorders","Rotterdamse haven","uur","De staking","sjordersbedrijven","de Rotterdamse haven","maandagochtend"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Rechter":2.0,"voorwaarden":2.0,"staking":2.0,"sjorders":2.0,"Rotterdamse haven":2.0,"uur":2.0,"De staking":1.0,"sjordersbedrijven":1.0,"de Rotterdamse haven":1.0,"maandagochtend":1.0}},"age_hours":6.487465736944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6594,"joy":0.0175,"surprise":0.1275,"sadness":0.055,"fear":0.0509,"anger":0.0433,"disgust":0.0465},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"market_signal","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":2,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a strike at the Rotterdam port, impacting the flow of goods, including food.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_2ebee7a2292d","title":"Amerikaanse actrice Diane Keaton (79) overleden","content":"De Amerikaanse actrice Diane Keaton is op 79-jarige leeftijd overleden, meldt het Amerikaanse medium People. Ze speelde onder andere in het filmepos The Godfather van regisseur Francis Ford Coppola. Ook speelde ze met de regisseur en acteur Woody Allen. Keaton werd in 1946 geboren in Los Angeles als Diane Halle. Keaton gebruikte de achternaam van haar moeder om verwarring te voorkomen met een andere actrice met dezelfde naam. The Godfather Ze werd in 1972 bekend bij het grote publiek toen ze de rol speelde van Kay Adams-Corleone, de vrouw van maffiabaas Michael Corleone in The Godfather. De film is gebaseerd op het gelijknamige boek van Mario Puzo. Keaton zei tegen People in 2022 dat ze de bestseller niet had gelezen voor ze voor de rol werd gecast. \"Ik wist er helemaal niets van. Ik deed gewoon auditie. Dat was geweldig voor me. En toen moest ik het boek wel lezen,\" zei Keaton. In 1977 won ze een Oscar voor haar rol in de film Annie Hall van Woody Allen. Het verhaal draait om de moeizame relatie tussen Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) en Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). \"Het was een geïdealiseerde versie van mezelf\", zei ze over haar rol in een interview. Dankzij onder meer haar rol als Annie belandde ze op de cover van Time Magazine in september 1977. Het Amerikaanse blad Rolling Stone omschreef haar in hetzelfde jaar als \"de nieuwe Katherine Hepburn\". Ze werkte veel samen met regisseur Allen met wie ze enige tijd een relatie had. Hij castte haar voor meerdere films waaronder Play it again, Sam (1972) en Manhattan (1979). In totaal hebben ze in acht films samengewerkt. Haar vriendschap met Allen bleef heel sterk. Ze bleef altijd achter hem staan, ook na de beschuldigingen van seksueel misbruik dat hij zou hebben gepleegd bij zijn geadopteerde dochter Dylan Farrow. Mannen niet belangrijk Behalve met Allen had ze ook relaties met acteurs Al Pacino en Warren Beatty, die volgens haar op verschillende \"decennia\" in haar leven kwamen. \"Woody was mijn twintiger jaren, Warren mijn dertiger en Al eind dertig begin veertig,\" zei ze in 2003 tegen de Britse The Telegraph. Hoewel ze een relatie had met meerdere grote namen in de filmindustrie is ze nooit getrouwd. Daarover zei ze op latere leeftijd dat ze realiseerde dat mannen niet belangrijk waren in haar leven. \"Ik weet nog dat toen ik jong was dat ik op een belachelijke manier geloofde dat je iemand zou vinden met wie je samen oud wordt. Dat ik niet getrouwd ben betekent niet dat het mijn leven minder maakt. Die oude vrijstermythe is onzin\". Op haar vijftigste, in 1996, adopteerde ze dochter Dexter, vijf jaar later zoon Duke. Het moederschap had haar naar eigen zeggen compleet veranderd.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586128","published_date":"2025-10-11T19:11:57","collected_date":"2025-10-12T01:51:32.373720","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":453,"author":null,"raw_content_length":3011,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":2.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Godfather van regisseur Francis Ford Coppola","Annie"],"persons":["Kay Adams-Corleone","Keaton","Oscar","Michael Corleone","People","Mario Puzo"],"locations":["Los Angeles","Halle","Keaton","Hall","Diane","Allen"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2665,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Amerikaanse actrice","De Amerikaanse actrice","79-jarige leeftijd","het Amerikaanse medium","het filmepos","regisseur","de regisseur","acteur","de achternaam","haar moeder"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Amerikaanse actrice":2.0,"De Amerikaanse actrice":1.0,"79-jarige leeftijd":1.0,"het Amerikaanse medium":1.0,"het filmepos":1.0,"regisseur":1.0,"de regisseur":1.0,"acteur":1.0,"de achternaam":1.0,"haar moeder":1.0}},"age_hours":6.759980916666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6915,"joy":0.043,"surprise":0.1592,"sadness":0.0486,"fear":0.0251,"anger":0.0143,"disgust":0.0182},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"scaling","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":0,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":0,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is an obituary.
