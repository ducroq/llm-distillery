Understanding this legacy requires identifying racially restrictive language and geolocating affected properties. The Mapping Prejudice project addresses this by engaging volunteers on the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform to transcribe covenants from scanned deeds and link them to modern parcel maps using transcribed legal descriptions. While the project has explored automation, it values crowdsourcing for its social impact and technical advantages. Historically, Mapping Prejudice relied on lexicon-based searching and, more recently, fuzzy matching to flag suspected covenants. However, fuzzy matching has increased false positives, burdening volunteers and raising scalability concerns. Additionally, while many properties can be mapped automatically, others still require time-intensive manual geolocation. We present a human-centered computing approach with two plug-and-play NLP pipelines: (1) a context-aware text labeling model that flags racially restrictive language with high precision and (2) a georeferencing module that extracts geographic descriptions from deeds and resolves them to real-world locations. Evaluated on historical deed documents from six counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin, our system reduces false positives in racial term detection by 25.96% while maintaining 91.73% recall and achieves 85.58% georeferencing accuracy within 1x1 square-mile ranges. These tools enhance document filtering and enrich spatial annotations, accelerating volunteer participation and reducing manual cleanup while strengthening public engagement.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05829","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.915381","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cshc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Jiyoon Pyo, Yuankun Jiao, Yao-Yi Chiang, Michael Corey","raw_content_length":1766,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["The Mapping Prejudice","Plug arXiv:2509.05829v2 Announce Type:","Mapping Prejudice"],"persons":["Zooniverse"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1763,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Human-Centered Racial Covenant Detection","Georeferencing","Plug","arXiv250905829v2 Announce Type","Abstract","racial covenants","twentieth-century property deeds","spatial and socioeconomic inequalities","this legacy","racially restrictive language"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Human-Centered Racial Covenant Detection":2.0,"Georeferencing":2.0,"Plug":2.0,"arXiv250905829v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"racial covenants":1.0,"twentieth-century property deeds":1.0,"spatial and socioeconomic inequalities":1.0,"this legacy":1.0,"racially restrictive language":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7731555033333337,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.9405000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6119,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.949,"joy":0.0086,"surprise":0.011,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.008,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":6,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents an NLP pipeline to improve the detection and georeferencing of racially restrictive covenants.

Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains.

Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass. This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data. For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head reconstruction.

We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying our framework.

If the number of time steps gets large, the computational cost of this reconstruction may get prohibitive. Given a representation of the intermediate solution, the time intervals over which the characteristic curves need to be solved backwards in time can be reduced by restarting the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) after certain time intervals. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs a low-rank representation of the solution at the restart times using a randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm with lazy evaluation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational complexity compared to the pure Numerical Flow Iteration from quadratic to linear in the number of times step while still keeping its memory complexity.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_47f19f9b4f74","title":"Unified Multimodal Model as Auto","content":"arXiv:2509.09666v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The pursuit of unified multimodal models (UMMs) has long been hindered by a fundamental schism between multimodal understanding and generation. Current approaches typically disentangle the two and treat them as separate endeavors with disjoint objectives, missing the mutual benefits. We argue that true unification requires more than just merging two tasks. It requires a unified, foundational objective that intrinsically links them. In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens, i.e., regarding understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. To implement this, we propose UAE, where we begin by pre-training the decoder with the proposed 700k long-context image-caption pairs to direct it to \"understand\" the fine-grained and complex semantics from the text. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL) to unify the two, which covers two complementary stages: (1) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual perception; (2) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. Our empirical results suggest that understanding can largely enhance generation (verified on GenEval), while generation, in turn, notably strengthens fine-grained visual perception like small object and color recognition (verified on MMT-Bench). This bidirectional improvement reveals a deep synergy: under the unified reconstruction objective, generation and understanding can mutually benefit each other, moving closer to truly unified multimodal intelligence.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.917862","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Zhiyuan Yan, Kaiqing Lin, Zongjian Li, Junyan Ye, Hui Han, Zhendong Wang, Hao Liu, Bin Lin, Hao Li, Xue Xu, Xinyan Xiao, Jingdong Wang, Haifeng Wang, Li Yuan","raw_content_length":1924,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["UAE"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1923,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Unified Multimodal Model","Auto","them","arXiv250909666v3 Announce Type","Abstract","The pursuit","unified multimodal models","UMMs","a fundamental schism","multimodal understanding"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Auto"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Unified Multimodal Model":2.0,"Auto":2.0,"them":2.0,"arXiv250909666v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The pursuit":1.0,"unified multimodal models":1.0,"UMMs":1.0,"a fundamental schism":1.0,"multimodal understanding":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773247180555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.417,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8834,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.885,"joy":0.0089,"surprise":0.0214,"sadness":0.0308,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.0255,"disgust":0.0184},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI model (UAE) for multimodal understanding and generation.

We study two public instruction-tuned models, Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-IT, using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) trained on residual-stream activations. Given a harmful prompt, we search the SAE latent space for feature sets whose ablation flips the model from refusal to compliance, demonstrating causal influence and creating a jailbreak. Our search proceeds in three stages: (1) Refusal Direction: find a refusal-mediating direction and collect SAE features near that direction; (2) Greedy Filtering: prune to a minimal set; and (3) Interaction Discovery: fit a factorization machine (FM) that captures nonlinear interactions among the remaining active features and the minimal set. This pipeline yields a broad set of jailbreak-critical features, offering insight into the mechanistic basis of refusal. Moreover, we find evidence of redundant features that remain dormant unless earlier features are suppressed.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce LaV-CoT, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash.

In this work, inspired by MultiMAE [2], we develop a masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm for multi-modal, multi-task learning in 3D medical imaging with brain MRIs. Our method treats each MRI sequence as a separate input modality, leveraging a late-fusion-style transformer encoder to integrate multi-sequence information (multi-modal) and individual decoder streams for each modality for multi-task reconstruction. This pretraining strategy guides the model to learn rich representations per modality while also equipping it to handle missing inputs through cross-sequence reasoning. The result is a flexible and generalizable encoder for brain MRIs that infers missing sequences from available inputs and can be adapted to various downstream applications. We demonstrate the performance and robustness of our method against an MAE-ViT baseline in downstream segmentation and classification tasks, showing absolute improvement of $10.1$ overall Dice score and $0.46$ MCC over the baselines with missing input sequences.

Given a directed graph $G$ and integers $d$ and $k$, the standard problem asks whether $G$ contains a packing of vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length $\\leq d$, covering at least $k$ vertices in total. In the multi-agent setting we consider, the vertex set is partitioned over several agents who reject a cycle packing as solution if it can be modified into an alternative packing that covers more of their own vertices. A cycle packing is called rejection-proof if no agent rejects it and the problem asks whether such a packing exists that covers at least $k$ vertices. We exploit the sunflower lemma on a set packing formulation of the problem to give a kernel for this $\\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem that is polynomial in $k$ for all constant values of $d$. We also provide a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)} + n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm based on it and show that this FPT algorithm is asymptotically optimal under the ETH. Further, we generalize the problem by including an additional positive integer $c$ in the input that naturally captures how much agents can modify a given cycle packing to reject it. For every constant $c$, the resulting problem simplifies from being $\\Sigma_2^P$-complete to NP-complete. The super-exponential lower bound already holds for $c=2$, though. We present an ad-hoc single-exponential algorithm for $c = 1$.

A key obstacle to improving their reliability is the severe scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for error attribution, as existing resources rely on costly and unscalable manual annotation. To address this bottleneck, we introduce Aegis, a novel framework for Automated error generation and attribution for multi-agent systems. Aegis constructs a large dataset of 9,533 trajectories with annotated faulty agents and error modes, covering diverse MAS architectures and task domains. This is achieved using a LLM-based manipulator that can adaptively inject context-aware errors into successful execution trajectories. Leveraging fine-grained labels and the structured arrangement of positive-negative sample pairs, Aegis supports three different learning paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_5086751149ba","title":"Enhancing Feature Fusion of U","content":"arXiv:2509.14610v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.921982","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Yue Cao, Quansong He, Kaishen Wang, Jianlong Xiong, Tao He","raw_content_length":1703,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DSC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1702,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Feature Fusion","arXiv250914610v2 Announce Type","Abstract","U-like networks","fundamental frameworks","medical image segmentation","skip connections","high-level semantics","low-level spatial details","their success"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["low-level spatial details"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Feature Fusion":2.0,"arXiv250914610v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"U-like networks":1.0,"fundamental frameworks":1.0,"medical image segmentation":1.0,"skip connections":1.0,"high-level semantics":1.0,"low-level spatial details":1.0,"their success":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773401208611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.7075,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4585,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8811,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.0341,"sadness":0.0143,"fear":0.0173,"anger":0.0234,"disgust":0.0205},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block to enhance feature fusion in U-like networks for medical image segmentation.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but faces challenges with computational constraints when applied to LLMs. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, though a single LoRA module often struggles with heterogeneous data across diverse domains. This paper addresses two critical challenges in federated LoRA fine-tuning: 1. determining the optimal number and allocation of LoRA experts across heterogeneous clients, and 2. enabling clients to selectively utilize these experts based on their specific data characteristics. We propose FedLEASE (Federated adaptive LoRA Expert Allocation and SElection), a novel framework that adaptively clusters clients based on representation similarity to allocate and train domain-specific LoRA experts. It also introduces an adaptive top-$M$ Mixture-of-Experts mechanism that allows each client to select the optimal number of utilized experts. Our extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedLEASE significantly outperforms existing federated fine-tuning approaches in heterogeneous client settings while maintaining communication efficiency.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15087","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.922772","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Lei Wang, Jieming Bian, Letian Zhang, Jie Xu","raw_content_length":1480,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Federated Learning","LoRA","Federated"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1479,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Adaptive LoRA Experts Allocation","Selection","Federated Fine","LLMs","arXiv250915087v2 Announce Type","Large Language Models","impressive capabilities","various tasks","them","domain-specific applications"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Adaptive LoRA Experts Allocation":2.0,"Selection":2.0,"Federated Fine":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv250915087v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"impressive capabilities":1.0,"various tasks":1.0,"them":1.0,"domain-specific applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7734313805555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.995999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7992,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9273,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0152,"sadness":0.0137,"fear":0.0255,"anger":0.0075,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel federated learning framework (FedLEASE) for fine-tuning LLMs, focusing on improved efficiency and performance in heterogeneous client settings.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15886","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.923202","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Paul Julius K\\\"uhn, Duc Anh Nguyen, Arjan Kuijper, Holger Graf, Dieter Fellner, Saptarshi Neil Sinha","raw_content_length":1973,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VFM","Visual Foundation Models"],"persons":["SAM2"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1972,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Visual Foundation Models","Range","arXiv250915886v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Point cloud segmentation","autonomous driving","3D scene understanding","voxel- and point-based methods","recent research","their compatibility"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["recent research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Visual Foundation Models":2.0,"Range":2.0,"arXiv250915886v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Point cloud segmentation":1.0,"autonomous driving":1.0,"3D scene understanding":1.0,"voxel- and point-based methods":1.0,"recent research":1.0,"their compatibility":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7734468825,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9139,"joy":0.0087,"surprise":0.0274,"sadness":0.0121,"fear":0.0066,"anger":0.0181,"disgust":0.0131},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel framework (RangeSAM) for LiDAR point cloud segmentation using Visual Foundation Models, which could improve the efficiency of autonomous driving and 3D scene understanding.

This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16198","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.924031","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","csse","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Jane Luo, Xin Zhang, Steven Liu, Jie Wu, Yiming Huang, Yangyu Huang, Chengyu Yin, Ying Xin, Jianfeng Liu, Yuefeng Zhan, Hao Sun, Qi Chen, Scarlett Li, Mao Yang","raw_content_length":1891,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Repository Planning Graph","RPG"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1890,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["RPG","A Repository Planning Graph","Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation","Announce Type","Abstract","Large language models","individual functions","single files","code","complete repositories"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"RPG":2.0,"A Repository Planning Graph":2.0,"Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"individual functions":1.0,"single files":1.0,"code":1.0,"complete repositories":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773477216944445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.548,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7096,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8746,"joy":0.0313,"surprise":0.0353,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0374,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0042},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research presents a novel approach to automated code generation, potentially reducing the energy and resource consumption associated with software development.

Although robust evaluation frameworks are essential for the safe development of medical LLMs, resources in Japanese are scarce and often consist of translated multiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this issue in two ways. First, we establish a performance baseline by applying a machine-translated version of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate two models: a high-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source model (LLM-jp-3.1). Secondly, we use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to systematically classify the benchmark's scenarios and rubric criteria. This allows us to identify 'contextual gaps' where the content is misaligned with Japan's clinical guidelines, healthcare systems or cultural norms.

Yet it remains unclear whether such twins truly mirror the people they emulate. We conducted 19 preregistered studies with a representative U.S. panel and their digital twins, each constructed from rich individual-level data, enabling direct comparisons between human and twin behavior across a wide range of domains and stimuli (including never-seen-before ones). Twins reproduced individual responses with 75% accuracy and seemingly low correlation with human answers (approximately 0.2). However, this apparently high accuracy was no higher than that achieved by generic personas based on demographics only. In contrast, correlation improved when twins incorporated detailed personal information, even outperforming traditional machine learning benchmarks that require additional data. Twins exhibited systematic strengths and weaknesses - performing better in social and personality domains, but worse in political ones - and were more accurate for participants with higher education, higher income, and moderate political views and religious attendance. Together, these findings delineate both the promise and the current limits of digital twins: they capture some relative differences among individuals but not yet the unique judgments of specific people. All data and code are publicly available to support the further development and evaluation of digital twin pipelines.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19088","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.925678","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","statap","cshc","cscy","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Tiany Peng, George Gui, Daniel J.

However, LiDAR's high cost continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD) systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723).

Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure.

MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.

This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior.

We propose a medical sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable, exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses, with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence first answers.

While visual information provides complementary semantic guidance, existing methods often underexploit its potential by relying on static visual representations. In this paper, we propose CSFNet, a Coarse-to-Separate-Fine Network that introduces a recursive semantic enhancement paradigm for more effective separation. CSFNet operates in two stages: (1) Coarse Separation, where a first-pass estimation reconstructs a coarse audio waveform from the mixture and visual input; and (2) Fine Separation, where the coarse audio is fed back into an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) model together with the visual stream. This recursive process produces more discriminative semantic representations, which are then used to extract refined audio. To further exploit these semantics, we design a speaker-aware perceptual fusion block to encode speaker identity across modalities, and a multi-range spectro-temporal separation network to capture both local and global time-frequency patterns. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two noisy datasets show that CSFNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with substantial coarse-to-fine improvements, validating the necessity and effectiveness of our recursive semantic enhancement framework.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22425","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.928473","language":"en","tags":["cssd","computer-science","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Ke Xue, Rongfei Fan,  Lixin, Dawei Zhao, Chao Zhu, Han Hu","raw_content_length":1472,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["fed","AVSR"],"persons":["Coarse Separation","Coarse"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1471,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Coarse","Fine","arXiv250922425v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Audio-visual speech separation","each speakers clean voice","mixtures","visual cues","lip movements","facial features"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Coarse":2.0,"Fine":2.0,"arXiv250922425v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Audio-visual speech separation":1.0,"each speakers clean voice":1.0,"mixtures":1.0,"visual cues":1.0,"lip movements":1.0,"facial features":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7736404158333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9178,"joy":0.0119,"surprise":0.028,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0141},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach to audio-visual speech separation (CSFNet).

Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax) formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward RL.

The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems. Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing several existing results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient. The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods, such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24665","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.930075","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","eesssy","cssy","computer-science","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":261,"author":"Shirantha Welikala, Hai Lin, Panos J.

Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24840","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.930490","language":"en","tags":["research","csce","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":181,"author":"Oussama Kharouiche, Aris Markogiannakis, Xiao Fei, Michail Chatzianastasis, Michalis Vazirgiannis","raw_content_length":1515,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.905,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Generating Single arXiv:2509.24840v2 Announce Type","RNA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1514,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cell2Text","Multimodal LLM","Generating Single","Announce Type","Abstract","Single-cell RNA","biology","the measurement","gene expression","cellular resolution"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Multimodal LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cell2Text":2.0,"Multimodal LLM":2.0,"Generating Single":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Single-cell RNA":1.0,"biology":1.0,"the measurement":1.0,"gene expression":1.0,"cellular resolution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7737175019444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8405,"joy":0.0224,"surprise":0.0305,"sadness":0.0044,"fear":0.0568,"anger":0.0229,"disgust":0.0225},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"Cell2Text is a novel multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into natural language descriptions.

However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values.

To enable supervised learning in this context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000 synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model.

Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches (e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust).

Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_afc3e508d838","title":"Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium","content":"arXiv:2509.26234v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.932711","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","eesssy","cssy","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Ayush Patnaik, Jackson Fogelquist, Adam B Zufall, Stephen K Robinson, Xinfan Lin","raw_content_length":1651,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1650,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Lithium","Machine Learning Detection","Lithium Plating","arXiv250926234v3 Announce Type","Abstract","fast charging","a critical degradation mechanism","capacity fade","catastrophic safety failures","Recent work"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Machine Learning Detection"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Lithium":3.0,"Machine Learning Detection":2.0,"Lithium Plating":2.0,"arXiv250926234v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"fast charging":1.0,"a critical degradation mechanism":1.0,"capacity fade":1.0,"catastrophic safety failures":1.0,"Recent work":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7737945655555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":0.7045000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8591,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4167,"joy":0.0033,"surprise":0.0207,"sadness":0.0204,"fear":0.4174,"anger":0.0686,"disgust":0.0529},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a machine learning method for detecting lithium plating in Li-ion batteries, a key factor in battery degradation.

The model has been obtained via homogenization and dimension reduction by B\\\"onlein at al. (2023). Its energy functional is the $\\Gamma$-limit of a three-dimensional nonlinear microstructured elasticity functional. In the derived effective model, the microstructure is incorporated as a local corrector problem, a system of linear elliptic partial differential equations posed on a three-dimensional representative volume element. The discretization uses Discrete Kirchhoff Triangle elements for the macroscopic bending-plate problem on a mesh of scale $H$, and first-order Lagrange elements for the microscopic corrector problem on an axis-aligned mesh of scale $h$. We show that the discretized model $\\Gamma$-converges to the continuous one as $(h,H)\\to 0$,provided that there exists a microstructure mesh such that the elasticity tensor is Lipschitz continuous on each mesh element. This extends earlier results by Rumpf et al. (2024) to prestrained composites. Our argument does not require any rate of convergence for the microscopic discretization error.

Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., \"Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities\"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.934315","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Jiayi Zhang, Simon Yu, Derek Chong, Anthony Sicilia, Michael R.

This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01521","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.934739","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Diptyaroop Maji, Kang Yang, Prashant Shenoy, Ramesh K Sitaraman, Mani Srivastava","raw_content_length":1792,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Time Series Foundation Models"],"persons":["CarbonX"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1789,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CarbonX An Open","arXiv251001521v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Computational decarbonization","carbon emissions","computing and societal systems","data centers","transportation","built environments","accurate fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["accurate fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CarbonX An Open":2.0,"arXiv251001521v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Computational decarbonization":1.0,"carbon emissions":1.0,"computing and societal systems":1.0,"data centers":1.0,"transportation":1.0,"built environments":1.0,"accurate fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773871455277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.091,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3818,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9233,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0404,"sadness":0.0114,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.007,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"CarbonX is a tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for decarbonization tasks, specifically carbon intensity forecasting and imputation.

Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO (G$^2$RPO) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our G$^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01982","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.935932","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Yujie Zhou, Pengyang Ling, Jiazi Bu, Yibin Wang, Yuhang Zang, Jiaqi Wang, Li Niu, Guangtao Zhai","raw_content_length":1558,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Singular Stochastic Sampling","Stochastic Differential Equations","G$^2$RPO","Flow Models arXiv:2510.01982v2"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1557,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["G2RPO Granular GRPO","Precise Reward","Flow Models","arXiv251001982v2","Announce Type","Abstract","The integration","online reinforcement learning","diffusion and flow models","a promising approach"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["online reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"G2RPO Granular GRPO":2.0,"Precise Reward":2.0,"Flow Models":2.0,"arXiv251001982v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The integration":1.0,"online reinforcement learning":1.0,"diffusion and flow models":1.0,"a promising approach":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7739173505555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.403500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8807,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8574,"joy":0.0494,"surprise":0.0455,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0132,"anger":0.0209,"disgust":0.0089},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm (G$^2$RPO) for improving the efficiency of reinforcement learning in generative models, which could potentially be used to optimize the design of materials or processes relevant to sustainability.

Examples include charities handling different needs (e.g., protecting animals vs. providing healthcare), charitable donations to different individuals, or municipal units handling different issues (e.g., security vs. transportation). We model these complementarities by assuming Leontief preferences; that is, each donor seeks to maximize an individually weighted minimum of all contributions across the charities. Decentralized funding may be inefficient due to a lack of coordination among the donors; centralized funding may be undesirable as it ignores the preferences of individual donors. We present a mechanism that combines the advantages of both methods. The mechanism efficiently distributes each donor's contribution so that no subset of donors has an incentive to redistribute their donations. Moreover, it is group-strategyproof, satisfies desirable monotonicity properties, maximizes Nash welfare, returns a unique Lindahl equilibrium, and can be implemented via natural best-response spending dynamics.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10286","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.965071","language":"en","tags":["research","csgt","preprints","econth","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Felix Brandt, Matthias Greger, Erel Segal-Halevi, Warut Suksompong","raw_content_length":1158,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["healthcare"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1157,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Charitable Donations","Leontief Preferences","replace-cross Abstract","the problem","public goods","nature","Examples","charities","different needs","animals"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Charitable Donations":2.0,"Leontief Preferences":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"public goods":1.0,"nature":1.0,"Examples":1.0,"charities":1.0,"different needs":1.0,"animals":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7750388477777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9337,"joy":0.0063,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0043,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a mechanism for coordinating charitable donations to complementary public goods using Leontief preferences.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_930f8d51c892","title":"On open","content":"arXiv:2402.03015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Using dominating sets to separate vertices of graphs is a well-studied problem in the larger domain of identification problems. In such problems, the objective is to choose a suitable dominating set $C$ of a graph $G$ which is also separating in the sense that the neighbourhoods of any two distinct vertices of $G$ have distinct intersections with $C$. Such a dominating and separating set $C$ of a graph is often referred to as a code in the literature. Depending on the types of dominating and separating sets used, various problems arise under various names in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the same realm of identification problems whereby the code, called open-separating dominating code, or OD-code for short, is a dominating set and uses open neighbourhoods for separating vertices. The paper studies the fundamental properties concerning the existence, hardness and minimality of OD-codes. Due to the emergence of a close and yet difficult to establish relation of the OD-code with another well-studied code in the literature called open (neighborhood)-locating dominating code (referred to as the open-separating total-dominating code and abbreviated as OTD-code in this paper), we compare the two codes on various graph families. Finally, we also provide an equivalent reformulation of the problem of finding OD-codes of a graph as a covering problem in a suitable hypergraph and discuss the polyhedra associated with OD-codes, again in relation to OTD-codes of some graph families already studied in this context.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03015","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.965679","language":"en","tags":["research","csdm","preprints","mathco","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Dipayan Chakraborty, Annegret K.

One drawback of these models is that they require a lot of high-quality data to perform well. This is often infeasible in practice, due to poor measurement infrastructure in legacy systems and the rapid build-up of new solar systems across the world. This paper proposes SolNet: a novel, general-purpose, multivariate solar power forecaster, which addresses these challenges by using a two-step forecasting pipeline which incorporates transfer learning from abundant synthetic data generated from PVGIS, before fine-tuning on observational data. Using actual production data from hundreds of sites in the Netherlands, Australia and Belgium, we show that SolNet improves forecasting performance over data-scarce settings as well as baseline models. We find transfer learning benefits to be the strongest when only limited observational data is available. At the same time we provide several guidelines and considerations for transfer learning practitioners, as our results show that weather data, seasonal patterns, amount of synthetic data and possible mis-specification in source location, can have a major impact on the results. The SolNet models created in this way are applicable for any land-based solar photovoltaic system across the planet where simulated and observed data can be combined to obtain improved forecasting capabilities.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14472","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.966467","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","eesssp","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Joris Depoortere, Johan Driesen, Johan Suykens, Hussain Syed Kazmi","raw_content_length":1525,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SolNet","PVGIS"],"persons":[],"locations":["Australia","Netherlands","Belgium"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1524,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SolNet","arXiv240514472v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Deep learning models","increasing prominence","recent years","the field","solar pho-tovoltaic PV forecasting","One drawback","these models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep learning models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SolNet":3.0,"arXiv240514472v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Deep learning models":1.0,"increasing prominence":1.0,"recent years":1.0,"the field":1.0,"solar pho-tovoltaic PV forecasting":1.0,"One drawback":1.0,"these models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7750850466666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8944,"joy":0.0193,"surprise":0.0505,"sadness":0.0132,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.0118,"disgust":0.0072},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel solar power forecasting model (SolNet) that uses transfer learning to improve accuracy, particularly in data-scarce environments.

However, a well-defined quantum complexity theory for these bosonic computations over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is missing. In this work, we lay foundations for such a research program. We introduce natural complexity classes and problems based on bosonic generalizations of BQP, the local Hamiltonian problem, and QMA. We uncover several relationships and subtle differences between standard Boolean classical and discrete variable quantum complexity classes and identify outstanding open problems. In particular: 1. We show that the power of quadratic (Gaussian) quantum dynamics is equivalent to the class BQL. More generally, we define classes of continuous-variable quantum polynomial time computations with a bounded probability of error based on higher-degree gates. Due to the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, it is not a priori clear whether a decidable upper bound can be obtained for these classes. We identify complete problems for these classes and demonstrate a BQP lower and EXPSPACE upper bound. We further show that the problem of computing expectation values of polynomial bosonic observables is in PSPACE. 2. We prove that the problem of deciding the boundedness of the spectrum of a bosonic Hamiltonian is co-NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that the problem of finding the minimum energy of a bosonic Hamiltonian critically depends on the non-Gaussian stellar rank of the family of energy-constrained states one optimizes over: for constant stellar rank, it is NP-complete; for polynomially-bounded rank, it is in QMA; for unbounded rank, it is undecidable.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04274","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.967300","language":"en","tags":["research","cscc","preprints","quant-ph","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":262,"author":"Ulysse Chabaud, Michael Joseph, Saeed Mehraban, Arsalan Motamedi","raw_content_length":1814,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.31,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum","Bosonic Quantum Computational Complexity arXiv:2410.04274v2","BQP","BQL"],"persons":[],"locations":["QMA"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1809,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bosonic Quantum Computational Complexity","arXiv241004274v2","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Quantum computing","physical systems","continuous degrees","freedom","the quantum states","light"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bosonic Quantum Computational Complexity":2.0,"arXiv241004274v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Quantum computing":1.0,"physical systems":1.0,"continuous degrees":1.0,"freedom":1.0,"the quantum states":1.0,"light":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775116349722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.2775,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8555,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7932,"joy":0.0218,"surprise":0.0204,"sadness":0.0108,"fear":0.0918,"anger":0.04,"disgust":0.0219},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on bosonic quantum computing complexity.

When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.967712","language":"en","tags":["eessiv","statml","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Darshan Thaker, Abhishek Goyal, Ren\\'e Vidal","raw_content_length":1410,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Frequency"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1409,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Frequency","replace-cross Abstract","Image restoration","high-quality images","degraded observations","the degradation process","the recovery problem","an inverse problem","a Bayesian context","the goal"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Frequency":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Image restoration":1.0,"high-quality images":1.0,"degraded observations":1.0,"the degradation process":1.0,"the recovery problem":1.0,"an inverse problem":1.0,"a Bayesian context":1.0,"the goal":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775131303611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.33150000000000013,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9337,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9236,"joy":0.0109,"surprise":0.0294,"sadness":0.0072,"fear":0.0041,"anger":0.0124,"disgust":0.0124},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for image restoration using diffusion models and frequency domain filtering.
