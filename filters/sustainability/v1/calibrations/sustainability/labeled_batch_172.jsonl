While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research investigates whether Pad\\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\\'eNets) can outperform conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in the diagnosis of electrical and mechanical faults from vibration and acoustic data. Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\\'eNets. These models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and acoustic sensor data. The Pad\\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as LeakyReLU. Results and Conclusion: Pad\\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33% for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced nonlinearity of Pad\\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in induction motor condition monitoring.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02599","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.614110","language":"en","tags":["preprints","eesssy","computer-science","cslg","research","cssy","cssd","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Sertac Kilickaya, Levent Eren","raw_content_length":1573,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PAON","Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks","Convolutional Neural Networks","the University of Ottaw","Pad\\'e Approximant Neural Networks for Enhanced Electric Motor Fault Diagnosis Using Vibration and Acoustic Data arXiv:2507.02599v2","Pad\\'e Approximant Neural Networks"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1568,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Pade Approximant Neural Networks","Enhanced Electric Motor Fault Diagnosis","Vibration","Acoustic Data","Announce Type","Abstract","Purpose","The primary aim","this study","fault diagnosis"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Pade Approximant Neural Networks"],"research_academic":["this study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Pade Approximant Neural Networks":3.0,"Enhanced Electric Motor Fault Diagnosis":2.0,"Vibration":2.0,"Acoustic Data":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Purpose":1.0,"The primary aim":1.0,"this study":1.0,"fault diagnosis":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7477575302777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8853,"joy":0.013,"surprise":0.0429,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.027,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.0092},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel neural network architecture for improved fault diagnosis in electric motors, potentially leading to increased efficiency and reduced downtime.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d694ba7dd447","title":"Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity","content":"arXiv:2508.18719v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18719","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.646319","language":"en","tags":["preprints","eesssy","computer-science","research","cssy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":294,"author":"Alessio Moreschini, Wei He, Romeo Ortega, Yiheng Lu, Tao Li","raw_content_length":1974,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.47,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PID","PID Passivity","Control (PID-PBC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1973,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity","PID-PBC","PIDs","Announce Type","Abstract","The key idea","PID Passivity-based Control","the passivity property","all positive gains","the PID controller"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["all positive gains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity":2.0,"PID-PBC":2.0,"PIDs":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The key idea":1.0,"PID Passivity-based Control":1.0,"the passivity property":1.0,"all positive gains":1.0,"the PID controller":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7483272519444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9044,"joy":0.0071,"surprise":0.0219,"sadness":0.019,"fear":0.0101,"anger":0.017,"disgust":0.0205},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel discretization method for PID controllers in power converters, aiming to improve stability and efficiency.

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8f66215f7a79","title":"Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding","content":"arXiv:2508.19982v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator. Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00648","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.653674","language":"en","tags":["preprints","statml","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Kushagra Chandak, Vincent Liu, Haanvid Lee","raw_content_length":1079,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Inverse Propensity Score","Context-Action Embedding Learning","MIPS","OPE","CAEL-MIPS","IPS"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1078,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Context","OPE","Announce Type","-policy","contextual bandits","finite action space","Inverse Propensity Score","IPS","weighting","a widely used method"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Context":2.0,"OPE":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"-policy":1.0,"contextual bandits":1.0,"finite action space":1.0,"Inverse Propensity Score":1.0,"IPS":1.0,"weighting":1.0,"a widely used method":1.0}},"age_hours":2.748401271666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.706,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4588,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9446,"joy":0.003,"surprise":0.016,"sadness":0.0136,"fear":0.0067,"anger":0.0077,"disgust":0.0085},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new algorithm (CAEL-MIPS) to improve off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, which could potentially lead to more efficient decision-making in various applications.

Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE). By assuming a continuous-time linear time-invariant system with simultaneously-diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a closed-form solution of the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently propagate uncertainties through the dynamics from keys to queries. A generalization of attention naturally arises as the maximum likelihood solution for filtering the trajectory of this linear SDE, with attention weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated query-key precisions. We further constrain the system dynamics and noise in order to obtain a simplified variant with the same computational and memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of zero decay and process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover a complex-valued generalization of ordinary dot-product attention with rotary positional encodings.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04154","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.654878","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Peter Racioppo","raw_content_length":1277,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Adaptive Filter Attention"],"persons":["Announce Type","Lyapunov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1276,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Attention","an Adaptive Filter","Announce Type","Adaptive Filter Attention","AFA","a novel attention mechanism","a learnable dynamics model","the computation","attention weights","queries"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Attention":2.0,"an Adaptive Filter":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Adaptive Filter Attention":1.0,"AFA":1.0,"a novel attention mechanism":1.0,"a learnable dynamics model":1.0,"the computation":1.0,"attention weights":1.0,"queries":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7484442408333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8803,"joy":0.0135,"surprise":0.0671,"sadness":0.0053,"fear":0.0086,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.0076},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism (AFA) for sequence modeling.

However, most existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning, multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges, we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction) operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and agentic baselines.

They are the most widespread information across populations and diseases, and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often treated as auxiliaries in model design, with limited attention being paid to learning their representations. This study explored the development of a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational model tailored to demographic attributes, focusing on age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and populations compositions from different geographic regions. The composition of GDP architecture was explored through examining combinations of ordering approaches and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into effective latent embeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GDP to generalize across task, diseases, and populations. In detailed composition, the sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models.

Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_94ed08ca602b","title":"Qubit","content":"arXiv:2509.08080v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising alternative for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The standard approach for encoding optimization problems on quantum processing units (QPUs) involves transforming them into their Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation. However, encoding constraints of optimization problems, particularly inequality constraints, into QUBO requires additional variables, which results in more qubits. Considering the limited availability of qubits in NISQ machines, existing encoding methods fail to scale due to their reliance on large numbers of qubits. We propose a generalized exponential penalty framework for QUBO inequality constraints inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. This paper presents an encoding strategy for inequality constraints in combinatorial optimization problems, inspired by a class of exponential functions, which we call exponential penalization. The initial idea of using exponential penalties for QUBO formulation was introduced by Montanez-Barrera et al. by applying a specific exponential function to reduce qubit requirements. In this work, we extend that approach by conducting a comprehensive study on a broader class of exponential functions, analyzing their theoretical properties and empirical performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that an exponential penalization achieves 57%, 83% qubit number reduction for Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), respectively. And we demonstrate comparable solution quality to classical with a probability of 6% and 21% accuracy for BPP with 8 and TSP with 12 qubits, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08080","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.656531","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cset","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":235,"author":"Meerzhan Kanatbekova, Vincenzo De Maio, Ivona Brandic","raw_content_length":1759,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.175,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Qubit arXiv:2509.08080v2 Announce Type:","Quantum","QUBO","Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization","NISQ"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1758,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Qubit","optimization problems","QUBO","arXiv250908080v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Quantum computing","a promising alternative","combinatorial optimization problems","The standard approach","quantum processing units"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Qubit":2.0,"optimization problems":2.0,"QUBO":2.0,"arXiv250908080v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Quantum computing":1.0,"a promising alternative":1.0,"combinatorial optimization problems":1.0,"The standard approach":1.0,"quantum processing units":1.0}},"age_hours":2.748501687222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.753,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7506,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8447,"joy":0.0315,"surprise":0.0997,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.0089,"disgust":0.003},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach to encoding optimization problems for quantum computing, specifically reducing qubit requirements.

Unlike traditional statistical agents such as Bayesian models, which may excel under well-specified conditions, large language models (LLMs) can generalize across diverse, real-world scenarios, raising new questions about how their strategies and behaviors compare to those of humans and other agent types. In this work, we compare outcomes and behavioral dynamics across humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting under identical conditions. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks. By establishing foundational behavioral baselines under matched conditions, this work provides a baseline for future studies in more applied, variable-rich environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.656959","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cshc","csai","csgt","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":213,"author":"Crystal Qian, Kehang Zhu, John Horton, Benjamin S.

Individuals, organizations, and LLMs respond to TOC through counterspeech or counternarrative initiatives. There is a wide variation in their goals, terminology, response strategies, and methods of evaluating impact. This paper identifies a taxonomy of online response strategies, which we call Online Discourse Engagement (ODE), to include any type of online speech to build healthier online public discourse. The literature on ODE makes contradictory assumptions about ODE goals and rarely distinguishes between them or rigorously evaluates their effectiveness. This paper categorizes 25 distinct ODE strategies, from humor and distraction to empathy, solidarity, and fact-based rebuttals, and groups these into a taxonomy of five response categories: defusing and distracting, engaging the speaker's perspective, identifying shared values, upstanding for victims, and information and fact-building. The paper then systematically reviews the evidence base for each of these categories. By clarifying definitions, cataloging response strategies, and providing a meta-analysis of research papers on these strategies, this article aims to bring coherence to the study of ODE and to strengthen evidence-informed approaches for fostering constructive ODE.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09921","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.663059","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Lisa Schirch, Kristina Radivojevic, Cathy Buerger","raw_content_length":1444,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ODE","TOC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1443,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Toxic Online Content","A Taxonomy","Response Strategies","the Evidence","TOC","arXiv250909921v2 Announce Type","Abstract","messages","digital platforms","public discourse"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Toxic Online Content":3.0,"A Taxonomy":2.0,"Response Strategies":2.0,"the Evidence":2.0,"TOC":2.0,"arXiv250909921v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"messages":1.0,"digital platforms":1.0,"public discourse":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7485444027777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.452,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7096,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0927,"joy":0.0019,"surprise":0.0034,"sadness":0.0098,"fear":0.0215,"anger":0.4785,"disgust":0.3923},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a taxonomy of online discourse engagement strategies to combat toxic online content.

To address these challenges, we present DeepDive to advance deep search agents. First, we propose a strategy to automatically synthesize complex, difficult, and hard-to-find questions from open knowledge graphs. Second, we apply end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning with deep search. To encourage diversity and reduce redundancy, we design a redundancy penalty that discourages repeated similar queries. Experiments show that DeepDive-32B achieves a new open-source competitive result on BrowseComp, outperforming WebSailor, DeepSeek-R1-Browse, and Search-o1.

We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts.

Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory.

Specifically, we focus on a class of games characterized by playerwise concave utilities and playerwise concave constraints. Prior results on the existence of Nash equilibria are not applicable to this class, as they rely on strong assumptions such as joint convexity of the feasible set. By leveraging topological fixed point theory and novel structural insights into the contractibility of feasible sets under playerwise concave constraints, we give an existence proof for Nash equilibria under weaker conditions. Having established existence, we then focus on the computation of Nash equilibria via independent gradient methods under the additional assumption that the utilities admit a potential function. To account for the possibly nonconvex feasible region, we employ a log barrier regularized gradient ascent with adaptive stepsizes.

However, developing PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g., 1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a 39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines, including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable, cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16548","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.666526","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cslg","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Yuyang Ding, Xinyu Shi, Juntao Li, Xiaobo Liang, Zhaopeng Tu, Min Zhang","raw_content_length":1732,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.19,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1731,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SCAN","Announce Type","Abstract","Process reward models","PRMs","fine-grained step-level evaluations","deeper reasoning processes","large language models","LLMs","complex tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["fine-grained step-level evaluations","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SCAN":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Process reward models":1.0,"PRMs":1.0,"fine-grained step-level evaluations":1.0,"deeper reasoning processes":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"complex tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7486628722222224,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9186,"joy":0.0067,"surprise":0.0325,"sadness":0.0155,"fear":0.0104,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method (SCAN) for improving the efficiency of training large language models, specifically for process reward models.

Hyper-parallel scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE).

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_91b782be8b2d","title":"Similarity Field Theory: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence","content":"arXiv:2509.18218v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \\times U \\to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p=(X_p,S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\\alpha}(K)={E\\in U \\mid S(E,K)\\ge \\alpha}$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E):=S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. At a high level, this framework reframes intelligence and interpretability as geometric problems on similarity fields -- preserving and composing level-set fibers -- rather than purely statistical ones. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in a framework that not only interprets large language models but also introduces a novel way of using them as experimental probes of societal cognition, supported by preliminary evidence across diverse consumer categories.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18218","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.673904","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":278,"author":"Kei-Sing Ng","raw_content_length":1971,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.39,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["S^{(p)})$","Similarity Field Theory"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["S_K(E):=S(E","a sequence $Z_p=(X_p"]},"char_count":1970,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Similarity Field Theory","A Mathematical Framework","Intelligence","entities","Announce Type","similarity relations","the structural basis","any comprehensible dynamic system","This paper","a mathematical framework"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Similarity Field Theory":3.0,"A Mathematical Framework":2.0,"Intelligence":2.0,"entities":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"similarity relations":1.0,"the structural basis":1.0,"any comprehensible dynamic system":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a mathematical framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7487349727777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.063,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8126,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8094,"joy":0.0789,"surprise":0.073,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0084,"anger":0.0196,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding intelligence and its application to societal cognition using large language models.

Concerns that companion chatbots may harm or replace real human relationships have been raised, but whether and how these social consequences occur remains unclear. In the present longitudinal study ($N = 183$), participants were randomly assigned to a chatbot condition (text chat with a companion chatbot) or to a control condition (text-based word games) for 10 minutes a day for 21 days. Participants also completed four surveys during the 21 days and engaged in audio recorded interviews on day 1 and 21. Overall, social health and relationships were not significantly impacted by companion chatbot interactions across 21 days of use. However, a detailed analysis showed a different story. People who had a higher desire to socially connect also tended to anthropomorphize the chatbot more, attributing humanlike properties to it; and those who anthropomorphized the chatbot more also reported that talking to the chatbot had a greater impact on their social interactions and relationships with family and friends. Via a mediation analysis, our results suggest a key mechanism at work: the impact of human-AI interaction on human-human social outcomes is mediated by the extent to which people anthropomorphize the AI agent, which is in turn motivated by a desire to socially connect. In a world where the desire to socially connect is on the rise, this finding may be cause for concern.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19515","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.675107","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cshc","csai","computer-science","research","cscy","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Rose E.

Yet, RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning, limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals: external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both effectiveness and practicality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21875","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.677477","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Samuel Yeh, Sharon Li, Tanwi Mallick","raw_content_length":1380,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.885,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Context arXiv:2509.21875v2 Announce Type","RAG","Retrieval-Augmented Generation"],"persons":["RAG"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1379,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LUMINA","Hallucinations","RAG System","Context","arXiv250921875v2 Announce Type","Retrieval-Augmented Generation","RAG","hallucinations","large language models","LLMs"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["RAG"],"renewable_energy":["RAG"],"ai_ml":["large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LUMINA":2.0,"Hallucinations":2.0,"RAG System":2.0,"Context":2.0,"arXiv250921875v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation":1.0,"RAG":1.0,"hallucinations":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7488644180555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8214,"joy":0.0023,"surprise":0.0297,"sadness":0.0252,"fear":0.0281,"anger":0.0317,"disgust":0.0616},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel framework (LUMINA) for detecting hallucinations in RAG systems, which could indirectly improve the reliability of LLMs used in climate modeling or sustainability analysis.

Software-based approaches, e.g., Address Sanitizer (ASAN), can detect such bugs with high precision, but with prohibitively high overhead. ARM's Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) offers a promising alternative to detect these bugs in hardware with a much lower overhead. However, in this paper, we perform a thorough investigation of Google Pixel 8, the first production implementation of ARM MTE, and show that MTE can only achieve coarse precision in bug detection compared with software-based approaches such as ASAN, mainly due to its 16-byte tag granularity. To address this issue, we present NanoTag, a system to detect memory safety bugs in unmodified binaries at byte granularity with ARM MTE. NanoTag detects intra-granule buffer overflows by setting up a tripwire for tag granules that may require intra-granule overflow detection. The memory access to the tripwire causes additional overflow detection in the software while using MTE's hardware to detect bugs for the rest of the accesses. We implement NanoTag based on the Scudo Hardened Allocator, the default memory allocator on Android since Android 11. Our evaluation results across popular benchmarks and real-world case studies show that NanoTag detects nearly as many memory safety bugs as ASAN while incurring similar run-time overhead to Scudo Hardened Allocator in MTE SYNC mode.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22027","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.683127","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Mingkai Li, Hang Ye, Joseph Devietti, Suman Jana, Tanvir Ahmed Khan","raw_content_length":1531,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NanoTag","byte"],"persons":["Address Sanitizer"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1530,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["NanoTag","Systems Support","Efficient Byte","arXiv250922027v2 Announce Type","Memory safety bugs","buffer","use","frees","the leading causes","software safety issues"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"NanoTag":2.0,"Systems Support":2.0,"Efficient Byte":2.0,"arXiv250922027v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Memory safety bugs":1.0,"buffer":1.0,"use":1.0,"frees":1.0,"the leading causes":1.0,"software safety issues":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7488805177777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7491,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0092,"sadness":0.0236,"fear":0.1055,"anger":0.0516,"disgust":0.0573},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents NanoTag, a system for detecting memory safety bugs with byte granularity using ARM MTE.

Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier should adapt to downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of pretrained models while preserving the input graph.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_acbd2579c617","title":"LongLive: Real","content":"arXiv:2509.22622v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.

Medication management is a complex task that requires synthesis of drug formulation and complete order instructions for safe use. Here, the performance of GPT 4o, an LLM available with ChatGPT, was tested for three medication management tasks. Methods: GPT-4o performance was tested using three medication tasks: identifying available formulations for a given generic drug name, identifying drug-drug interactions (DDI) for a given medication regimen, and preparing a medication order for a given generic drug name. For each experiment, the models raw text response was captured exactly as returned and evaluated using clinician evaluation in addition to standard LLM metrics, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF IDF) vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE 1/ROUGE L F1) between each response and its reference string. Results: For the first task of drug-formulation matching, GPT-4o had 49% accuracy for generic medications being matched to all available formulations, with an average of 1.23 omissions per medication and 1.14 hallucinations per medication. For the second task of drug-drug interaction identification, the accuracy was 54.7% for identifying the DDI pair. For the third task, GPT-4o generated order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors in 65.8% of cases. Conclusions: Model performance for basic medication tasks was consistently poor. This evaluation highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22926","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.684955","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Kelli Henry, Steven Xu, Kaitlin Blotske, Moriah Cargile, Erin F.

Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior.

However, its performance is often limited by the scarcity of labeled EMG data, significant cross-user variability, and poor generalization to unseen gestures. To address these challenges, we propose SeqEMG-GAN, a conditional, sequence-driven generative framework that synthesizes high-fidelity EMG signals from hand joint angle sequences. Our method introduces a context-aware architecture composed of an angle encoder, a dual-layer context encoder featuring the novel Ang2Gist unit, a deep convolutional EMG generator, and a discriminator, all jointly optimized via adversarial learning. By conditioning on joint kinematic trajectories, SeqEMG-GAN is capable of generating semantically consistent EMG sequences, even for previously unseen gestures, thereby enhancing data diversity and physiological plausibility. Experimental results show that classifiers trained solely on synthetic data experience only a slight accuracy drop (from 57.77% to 55.71%). In contrast, training with a combination of real and synthetic data significantly improves accuracy to 60.53%, outperforming real-only training by 2.76%.

Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23441","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.686201","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Xuanming Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Samuel Yeh, Sharon Li","raw_content_length":1257,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CooT"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1256,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cognition","LLMs","arXiv250923441v2 Announce Type","Large language models","complex reasoning","harmful behaviors","Current alignment strategies","safety","model weights","these controls"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cognition":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"arXiv250923441v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"complex reasoning":1.0,"harmful behaviors":1.0,"Current alignment strategies":1.0,"safety":1.0,"model weights":1.0,"these controls":1.0}},"age_hours":2.748985237222222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6983,"joy":0.0121,"surprise":0.0191,"sadness":0.0371,"fear":0.072,"anger":0.0706,"disgust":0.0908},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a novel decoding-time framework (CooT) for LLMs that aims to improve safety and social reasoning.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8825b2f63a50","title":"SIG","content":"arXiv:2509.23852v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing (WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game and animation production.

DualFlow conditions 3D motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.

Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \\emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26041","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.693737","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Arash Marioriyad, Shaygan Adim, Nima Alighardashi, Mahdieh Soleymani Banghshah, Mohammad Hossein Rohban","raw_content_length":1921,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AIME","CoT","GSM-Hard"],"persons":["UniADILR","Accuracy Without Acknowledgement","Unspoken Hints"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1920,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Unspoken Hints","Accuracy","Acknowledgement","LLM Reasoning","arXiv250926041v2","Announce Type","Large language models","LLMs","thought","mathematical and logical reasoning tasks"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Reasoning","Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Unspoken Hints":2.0,"Accuracy":2.0,"Acknowledgement":2.0,"LLM Reasoning":2.0,"arXiv250926041v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"thought":1.0,"mathematical and logical reasoning tasks":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7491165883333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9421,"joy":0.003,"surprise":0.0174,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0116,"anger":0.0103,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the faithfulness of LLM reasoning, specifically in the context of chain-of-thought prompting.

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities.

Learning Better Reward Model with Latent Space Synthesis","content":"arXiv:2509.26074v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data. Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.

However, its practical utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a \\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts. Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \\textit{ReLU} activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding of adversarial robustness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26327","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.695449","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csit","computer-science","cslg","research","mathit","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Charles Westphal, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi","raw_content_length":1446,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory of","The Information Bottleneck"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1445,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory","Deep Learning","arXiv250926327v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The Information Bottleneck","IB principle","a compelling theoretical framework","neural networks","NNs","its practical utility"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Deep Learning","neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Generalized Information Bottleneck Theory":2.0,"Deep Learning":2.0,"arXiv250926327v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The Information Bottleneck":1.0,"IB principle":1.0,"a compelling theoretical framework":1.0,"neural networks":1.0,"NNs":1.0,"its practical utility":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7491743008333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8973,"joy":0.0185,"surprise":0.0345,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0134,"anger":0.0185,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework (Generalized Information Bottleneck) to improve the efficiency and generalization of deep learning models.

Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00507","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.696666","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Yurun Chen, Xavier Hu, Yuhan Liu, Ziqi Wang, Zeyi Liao, Lin Chen, Feng Wei, Yuxi Qian, Bo Zheng, Keting Yin, Shengyu Zhang","raw_content_length":1962,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM"],"persons":["Knowledge Graphs arXiv:2510.00507v2 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1961,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Graph2Eval","Automatic Multimodal Task Generation","Agents","Knowledge Graphs","evaluation","arXiv251000507v2 Announce Type","Abstract","multimodal LLM-driven agents","autonomy","generalization"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["Graph2Eval"],"ai_ml":["multimodal LLM-driven agents"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Graph2Eval":2.0,"Automatic Multimodal Task Generation":2.0,"Agents":2.0,"Knowledge Graphs":2.0,"evaluation":2.0,"arXiv251000507v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"multimodal LLM-driven agents":1.0,"autonomy":1.0,"generalization":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7492028824999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4939,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8914,"joy":0.0076,"surprise":0.0524,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.0147,"anger":0.0143,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a framework (Graph2Eval) for automatically generating tasks to evaluate AI agents.

This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks.

These biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators, encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization. Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1 without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to the real world.

However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c95d14153af9","title":"Engineering Emergence","content":"arXiv:2510.02649v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A defining property of complex systems is that they have multiscale structure. How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue that within systems there emerges a hierarchy of scales that contribute to a system's causal workings. An intuitive example is how a computer can be described at the level of its hardware circuitry (its microscale) but also its machine code (a mesoscale) and all the way up at its operating system (its macroscale). Here we show that even simple systems possess this kind of emergent hierarchy, which usually forms over only a small subset of the super-exponentially many possible scales of description. To capture this formally, we extend the theory of causal emergence (version 2.0) so as to analyze how causal contributions span the full multiscale structure of a system. Our analysis reveals that systems can be classified along a taxonomy of emergence, such as being either top-heavy or bottom-heavy in their causal workings. From this new taxonomy of emergence, we derive a measure of complexity based on a literal notion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the scales of a system) and compare this to the standard network science definition of scale-freeness based on degree distribution, showing the two are closely related. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to engineer not just the degree of emergence in a system, but to control it with pinpoint precision.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02649","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.698872","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csit","computer-science","research","mathit","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":235,"author":"Abel Jansma, Erik Hoel","raw_content_length":1486,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.175,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1485,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Engineering Emergence","Announce Type","A defining property","complex systems","multiscale structure","this multiscale structure","systems","a hierarchy","scales","a systems causal workings"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Engineering Emergence":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"A defining property":1.0,"complex systems":1.0,"multiscale structure":1.0,"this multiscale structure":1.0,"systems":1.0,"a hierarchy":1.0,"scales":1.0,"a systems causal workings":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749275803333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.1105,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8238,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.1252,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0101,"anger":0.016,"disgust":0.0121},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for understanding and engineering emergence in complex systems.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_39c94a61b917","title":"Model-Based Ranking of Source Languages for Zero","content":"arXiv:2510.03202v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on 56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all available target data for ranking.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03202","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.699273","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Abteen Ebrahimi, Adam Wiemerslage, Katharina von der Wense","raw_content_length":1142,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.83,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NN-Rank","NER","Model-Based Ranking of Source Languages for Zero arXiv:2510.03202v2"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1141,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Model-Based Ranking","Source Languages","POS","NER","arXiv251003202v2 Announce Type","Abstract","NN-Rank","an algorithm","source languages","cross-lingual transfer"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["NER"],"renewable_energy":["NER"],"ai_ml":["an algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Model-Based Ranking":2.0,"Source Languages":2.0,"POS":2.0,"NER":2.0,"arXiv251003202v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"NN-Rank":1.0,"an algorithm":1.0,"source languages":1.0,"cross-lingual transfer":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7492917616666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9,"joy":0.0146,"surprise":0.05,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0158,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents an algorithm (NN-Rank) for ranking source languages for cross-lingual transfer learning, improving the efficiency of training AI models.
