This implies, in particular, for quantum groups of finite type, the structure constants for multiplication and for action on tensor product with respect to canonical basis are governed by positive coefficients. A key ingredient is the thickening construction, an algebraic technique that embeds a suitable approximation of the tensor of a lowest weight module and a highest weight module of $\\dot{\\mathbf{U}}$ into the negative part $\\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}^-$ of a larger quantum group. This allows us to inherit the desired positivity for the tensor product from the well-established positivity of the canonical basis of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{U}}^-$.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12154","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.018760","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathqa","mathematics","research","mathrt","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Jiepeng Fang, Xuhua He","raw_content_length":1209,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["\\mathbb{N}[v"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1206,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Positivity properties","canonical bases","dotmathbfU","the canonical basis elements","new Abstract","that the canonical basis","a modified quantum group","strong positivity properties","spherical parabolic subalgebras","Our main result"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Our main result"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Positivity properties":2.0,"canonical bases":2.0,"dotmathbfU":2.0,"the canonical basis elements":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"that the canonical basis":1.0,"a modified quantum group":1.0,"strong positivity properties":1.0,"spherical parabolic subalgebras":1.0,"Our main result":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7585626255555553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.36,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.872,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8079,"joy":0.1079,"surprise":0.0427,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0054,"anger":0.0179,"disgust":0.0125},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical research.

In this paper, we endow the space of decorated planar rooted forests with a two-parameters family of coproducts, making it into a weighted infinitesimal bialgebra. A combinatorial characterization of the coproducts is given via the notion of forest biideals. Furthermore, by constructing a bilinear symmetric form and introducing a new grafting operation on rooted forests, we describe the associated dual products. We also introduce the notion of the pair-weight 1-cocycle condition and investigate the universal properties of decorated planar rooted forests satisfying this condition. This leads to the definition of a weighted $\\Omega$-cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebra. As applications, we identify the initial object in the category of free cocycle infinitesimal unitary bialgebras on undecorated planar rooted forests, corresponding to the well-known noncommutative Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra. In addition, we establish isomorphisms between different coproduct structures and construct a pre-Lie algebra structure on decorated planar rooted forests.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12239","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.023784","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathematics","research","mathco","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Lo\\\"ic Foissy (LMPA), Yunzhou Xie (NJUST), Dawei Zhang (NJUST), Yi Zhang (NJUST)","raw_content_length":1264,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Yang-Baxter"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\Omega$-cocycle"]},"char_count":1263,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Cocycle","infinitesimal bialgebras","Announce Type","new Abstract","The concept","weighted infinitesimal bialgebras","an algebraic framework","the non-homogeneous associative Yang-Baxter equation","this paper","the space"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["an algebraic framework"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Cocycle":2.0,"infinitesimal bialgebras":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The concept":1.0,"weighted infinitesimal bialgebras":1.0,"an algebraic framework":1.0,"the non-homogeneous associative Yang-Baxter equation":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"the space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7587374319444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8946,"joy":0.036,"surprise":0.0361,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0052,"anger":0.0139,"disgust":0.0094},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is a theoretical mathematics paper.

We define the joint facial subspace $T$ as the span of the face of $C - D$ generated by $0$, with its affine translation $T_a$ containing $C \\cap D$. The intersections $C \\cap T_a$ and $D \\cap T_a$ are faces of the original sets, establishing $T_a$ as a bilateral facial reduction with parallels to Borwein-Wolkowicz facial reduction in conic programming. When reducing the domains of two convex functions to their joint facial subspace $T_a$, their relative interiors then always intersect, enabling unqualified application of classical theorems via localization. Key generalizations include subdifferential additivity, normal cones of intersections, a subdifferential chain rule, attained infimal convolution for $(f+g)^*,$ and an exact Fenchel-Rockafellar dual. We characterize $T$ via generated faces and computationally through an iterative process converging in at most $n$ steps in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.

We then review the lamination techniques (limit-leaf stability, local removable singularity, and singular structure theorems), the dynamics theorem, bounds on topology and index for complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite total curvature, and the resolution of the embedded Calabi-Yau problem for finite genus and countably many ends. Throughout we emphasize the interaction between topology, flux, curvature estimates, and the structure of related moduli spaces.

In this paper, we show that, surprisingly, the category of groups is a tangent category whose tangent bundle functor is induced by abelianization and whose differential bundles correspond to abelian groups. We generalize this construction by introducing the concept of linear assignments, which are endofunctors assigning to every object a commutative monoid in a natural and idempotent manner.

We show that any finitely cocomplete regular unital category is a tangent category whose tangent bundle functor is induced by the canonical abelianization functor, which is a monadic linear assignment.

Controlling glycosylation remains difficult due to intrinsic pathway complexity, limited online measurements, and a lack of tailored control strategies. This work applies an adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (ANMPC) framework to a fed-batch mAb production process, using a multiscale model that links extracellular conditions to intracellular Golgi reactions to predict glycan profiles. Model parameters are updated online as new measurements arrive, after which a shrinking-horizon optimization computes the control inputs; only the first control move is implemented each cycle. Case studies show that, with a minimal day-1 galactose excitation, ANMPC mitigates model-plant mismatch and achieves up to 130% and 96% higher performance than open-loop optimization and state NMPC, respectively. Under more realistic conditions (partial measurement availability and longer preparation time), ANMPC maintains comparable performance, indicating robustness to practical limitations. Overall, the results demonstrate that ANMPC can actively shape glycan distributions in silico and offers a viable path toward closed-loop control of mAb glycosylation.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12333","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.028070","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathoc","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Yingjie Ma, Jing Guo, Alexis B.

When there exists an epimorphism $G^\\mathrm{orb}(L)\\to G^\\mathrm{orb}(L')$, we denote this by $L\\succeq L'$ and explore the relationships between the two links. Specifically, we prove that if $L\\succeq L'$ and $L$ is a Montesinos link with $r$ rational tangles $(r\\geq 3)$, then $L'$ is either a Montesinos link with at most $r+1$ rational tangles or a certain connected sum. We further show that if $L$ is a small link, then there are only finitely many links $L'$ satisfying $L\\succeq L'$.

This paper investigates the application of the polyhedral bundle method to standard SDPs. The basic idea of this method is to approximate semidefinite constraints using linear constraints, and thereby transform the SDP problem into a series of quadratic programming subproblems. However, the number of linear constraints often increases continuously during the iteration process, leading to a significant reduction in the solution efficiency. Therefore, based on the idea of limiting the upper bound on the number of bundles, we heuristically select the upper bound through numerical experiments according to the rank of the primal optimal solution and propose a modified subproblem. In this way, under the premise of ensuring the approximation ability of the lower approximation model, we minimize the number of bundles as much as possible to improve the solution efficiency of the subproblems. The algorithm performs well in both Max-Cut problems and random SDP problems. In particular, for random sparse SDP problems with low condition numbers, under the condition of a relative accuracy of \\(10^{-4}\\), it shows a significant improvement compared with algorithms such as interior-point methods.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12374","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.030804","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathoc","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Zilong Cui, Ran Gu","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SDP","linear","Heuristic Bundle Upper"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bundle Upper Bound","Semidefinite Programming","Announce Type","new Abstract","Semidefinite programming","SDP","a fundamental class","convex optimization problems","diverse applications","mathematics"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Semidefinite Programming","Semidefinite programming"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bundle Upper Bound":2.0,"Semidefinite Programming":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Semidefinite programming":1.0,"SDP":1.0,"a fundamental class":1.0,"convex optimization problems":1.0,"diverse applications":1.0,"mathematics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.758993659166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.8709999999999996,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0258,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.897,"joy":0.0326,"surprise":0.0349,"sadness":0.0047,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.0144,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a modified algorithm for semidefinite programming, which is used in various applications including optimization problems related to energy systems and resource allocation.

Solving instances of the benchmark library PESPlib to optimality continues to pose a challenge. As a further approach towards this goal, we remodel the problem by a time discretization of the underlying graph and consider arc-based as well as path-based integer programming formulations. For the path-based case, we use cycles on the graph expansion of the operational lines as variables and, therefore, include more of the problem inherent structure into the model. A consequence is the validity of several known inequalities and a lower bound on the LP-relaxation, that is the best known to date. As an extension we integrate passenger routing into the new model. The proposed models have an advantage in the linear programming relaxation, on the one hand, but have an increased problem size, on the other hand. We define the corresponding pricing problems for the use of column generation to handle the size.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_23c12c99ee52","title":"Liouville results for $(p,q)$","content":"arXiv:2510.12486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we present a series of Liouville-type theorems for a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations featuring reactions that depend on the solution and its gradient. Specifically, we investigate equations of the form $-\\Delta_p u - \\Delta_q u = f(u,\\nabla u)$ with $p > q > 1$, where the nonlinearity $f$ takes forms such as $u^s|\\nabla u|^m$ or $u^s + M|\\nabla u|^m$ ($s, m\\geq 0$). Our approach is twofold. For cases where the reaction term satisfies $|f(u,\\nabla u)|\\leq g(u)|\\nabla u|^m$ with $m>q$ and $g$ is continuous, we prove that every bounded solution (without sign restriction) in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ is constant by means of an Ishii-Lions type technique. In the remaining scenarios, we turn to the Bernstein method. The application of this method to the nonhomogeneous operator requires a nontrivial adaptation, as, roughly speaking, constant coefficients are replaced by functions that may not be bounded from above, which enables us to establish a crucial a priori estimate for the gradient of solutions in any domain $\\Omega$. This estimate, in turn, implies the desired Liouville properties on the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^N$. As a consequence, we have fully extended Lions Liouville-type result for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to the $(p,q)$-Laplacian setting, while for the $(p,q)$ generalized Lane-Emden equation, we provide an initial contribution in the direction of the classical result by Gidas and Spruck for $p=q=2$, as well as that of Serrin and Zou for $p=q$.

This yields a representation of the vector process in terms of independent non-homogeneous Skellam processes. In the general case, the decomposition involves independent Poisson processes. The second model is a birth-death-migration vector process. In the case of the linear death-migration we show that, for a fixed time instant, the vector is equal in distribution to the sum of two independent Multinomial random variables. As a byproduct we derive the distribution of a pure migration process. Finally, we study the described vector processes time-changed with the inverse of Bernstein subordinator, establishing a general result concerning the relatioship between fractional difference-differential equations and the probability mass function of a wider class of point processes.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12531","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.043986","language":"en","tags":["mathpr","preprints","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":150,"author":"Fabrizio Cinque, Enzo Orsingher","raw_content_length":1059,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.75,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Skellam"],"persons":["Multinomial"],"locations":["Bernstein"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1058,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251012531v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","two different types","vector point processes","interacting components","a migration-type effect","The first case","two groups","which","their states"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251012531v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"two different types":1.0,"vector point processes":1.0,"interacting components":1.0,"a migration-type effect":1.0,"The first case":1.0,"two groups":1.0,"which":1.0,"their states":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7594426569444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9113,"joy":0.006,"surprise":0.0149,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0162,"anger":0.0206,"disgust":0.0268},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical mathematical models of interacting point processes.

Among the most well-known results in this area are Korovkin-type approximation theorems, which provide simple and elegant criteria for convergence by testing only on a small set of functions. Motivated by these classical results and their extensions, we focus on versions that preserve exponential functions and incorporate modern summability techniques. In this paper, we establish Korovkin-type theorems that preserve exponential functions by employing power series convergence and a special case thereof. By considering approximation through Borel-type power series convergence via integral summability, we provide an alternative framework that applies in cases where classical convergence or ordinary Borel convergence fails, and we offer a comparative analysis of the corresponding theorems. We also present illustrative examples in which the classical results fail, while the proposed approach remains applicable. In addition, the rate of convergence is analyzed through the modulus of continuity.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12568","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.048398","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathfa","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":163,"author":"Dilek S\\\"oylemez, Mehmet \\\"Unver","raw_content_length":1198,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.815,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Borel"],"persons":["Korovkin arXiv:2510.12568v1 Announce Type","Korovkin"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1197,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Korovkin","functions","arXiv251012568v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Approximation theory","the development","positive linear operators","classes","the most well-known results","this area"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["the development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Korovkin":2.0,"functions":2.0,"arXiv251012568v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Approximation theory":1.0,"the development":1.0,"positive linear operators":1.0,"classes":1.0,"the most well-known results":1.0,"this area":1.0}},"age_hours":2.759594085,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.559,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9118,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.893,"joy":0.0343,"surprise":0.0475,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0128,"disgust":0.0038},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical advancements in approximation theory, specifically Korovkin-type theorems.

We raise this bound to $4g - 3$ in the setting of surfaces of genus $g \\ge 7$. A new ingredient is a finer study of the commutation relations in $\\operatorname{PMod}(\\Sigma)$. We use the relations arising from a certain pants decomposition of $\\Sigma_g$ to show that any representation of dimension $\\le 4g - 4$ is forced to kill a natural subgroup of the Torelli group. We also establish lower bounds for the dimension of faithful representations of related groups: the Johnson group of a closed surface, arbitrarily low terms of the Johnson filtration of a compact surface with one boundary component, and pure braid groups. These lower bounds grow linearly on the genus of the surfaces and the number of strands of the braids. Finally, we also provide some evidence that greater lower bounds for the low-genus cases should lead to improved lower bounds for $g \\gg 0$.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12591","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.051114","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathematics","mathgr","research","mathgt","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Thiago Brevidelli","raw_content_length":1098,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.92,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Torelli","Korkmaz"],"persons":["Johnson"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\operatorname{PMod}(\\Sigma)$."]},"char_count":1095,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the mapping class group","Lower bounds","faithful linear representations","subgroups","genus","arXiv251012591v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Korkmaz","the lower bound","the dimension"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["faithful linear representations"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the mapping class group":3.0,"Lower bounds":2.0,"faithful linear representations":2.0,"subgroups":2.0,"genus":2.0,"arXiv251012591v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Korkmaz":1.0,"the lower bound":1.0,"the dimension":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7596978713888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8783,"joy":0.0248,"surprise":0.0233,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0156,"anger":0.0297,"disgust":0.0228},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_aaae45b5f2e9","title":"On dynamical invariants of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume","content":"arXiv:2510.12606v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the density of coadjoint orbits, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12606","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.052258","language":"en","tags":["mathds","preprints","mathmp","mathematics","mathdg","research","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Robert Cardona, Julian Chaidez, Francisco Torres de Lizaur","raw_content_length":1085,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["non-Anosov","Announce Type","Arnold"],"locations":["Khesin","Ruelle"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1084,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["dynamical invariants","coadjoint orbits","3D volume","Announce Type","new Abstract","The helicity","asymptotic linking number","exact volume-preserving vector fields","3-manifolds","volume-preserving transformations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"dynamical invariants":2.0,"coadjoint orbits":2.0,"3D volume":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The helicity":1.0,"asymptotic linking number":1.0,"exact volume-preserving vector fields":1.0,"3-manifolds":1.0,"volume-preserving transformations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7597461455555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.1405000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5719,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.482,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.0349,"sadness":0.0991,"fear":0.2037,"anger":0.0961,"disgust":0.0795},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical mathematics research.

The cone length is the minimum number of cofibations necessary to get a space in the homotopy type of $X$, starting from a suspension and attaching suspensions. The LS-category of a space is always less than or equal to its cone length. Moreover, these two invariants differ by at most one. In 1981, J.-M. Lemaire and F.

Several examples showcasing the properties of these eigenvalues and the zero sets of rational inner functions in the Schur--Agler class are also presented. We further generalize this result to a large class of non-commuting (NC) holomorphic functions whose ambient domain is given by the unit ball of a matrix of linear polynomials. This includes the NC counterparts of the unit polydisk and the Euclidean unit ball. We also show for functions in the Schur--Agler class over NC matrix unit balls that their zeros along the topological boundary are contained in an appropriately defined `approximate point spectrum' of the associated realization operator, and so are points along the Shilov boundary where the boundary values are not isometric/coisometric.

In this paper, we prove identities involving polysymmetric functions through bijections and sign-reversing involutions. In their paper titled \"Polysymmetric functions and motivic measures of configuration spaces\", Asvin G and Andrew O'Desky introduced the algebra of polysymmetric functions (PSym) which can be defined as the tensor product of copies of the symmetric functions algebra (Sym) where the $i$th tensor factor is scaled by $i$. On one hand, we can obtain bases of this algebra by taking tensor products of the bases of Sym.

A key tool in the proof of this result was an arithmetic regularity lemma for the Gowers $U^3$-norm by Green and Tao, which resulted in tower-type bounds (in terms of $\\mu^{-1}$) on both $\\ell$ and $q$.

Quantizing ultrarelativistic interior modes on a regular spacelike slice with a Robin boundary at a stretched horizon leads to a self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami problem with Heun-type quantization. A maximum-entropy area ensemble introduces an intensive areal temperature $T_A$, and Weyl/heat-kernel asymptotics control the resulting statistical mechanics. The leading equations of state follow universally from the spatial Weyl volume coefficient: in a canonical ensemble of $N$ ultrarelativistic bosons one finds $A = 3 N k_B T_A$ up to a boundary-dependent constant, while in the massless grand-canonical sector $A \\propto T_A^{4}$ with a generalized Planck spectrum and a Wien displacement relation. These scaling exponents are insensitive to Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin data and to the foliation; only numerical prefactors vary. Embedding the construction into a static four-dimensional background via Matsubara factorization reproduces the 4D Weyl law and yields a finite matter entropy $S_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\propto A^{3/4}$, parametrically subleading to the Bekenstein-Hawking term after standard renormalization.

In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a variable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function (PDF), $p(\\xi)$, after random waiting times $\\theta$. This model is relevant across many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum dots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a general analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by averaging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for stationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and jump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key results emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function quickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting times with $\\mu>2$, , \\emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically reduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time points}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the system's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible. Furthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes independent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring only modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory lengths. Building upon earlier work that established the universality of the two-point correlation function (i.e., a unique formal expression depending solely on the variance of $\\xi$ and on the waiting-time PDF), the present study extends that universality to the full statistical description of a broad class of renewal-type stochastic processes.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11747","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.066635","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","mathematics","research","statth","cond-matstat-mech","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Marco Bianucci, Mauro Bologna, Daniele Lagomarsino-Oneto, Riccardo Mannella","raw_content_length":1944,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Probability Density Function","PDF"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["p(\\xi)$"]},"char_count":1943,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Universal behaviors","the multi","arXiv251011747v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Stochastic processes","renewal properties","powerful tools","modeling systems","memory effects"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Universal behaviors":2.0,"the multi":2.0,"arXiv251011747v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Stochastic processes":1.0,"renewal properties":1.0,"powerful tools":1.0,"modeling systems":1.0,"memory effects":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760231473333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8462,"joy":0.0165,"surprise":0.0304,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0382,"anger":0.0331,"disgust":0.0306},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on stochastic processes and their correlation functions.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_d46198f3a41a","title":"Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases","content":"arXiv:2510.11818v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11818","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.068587","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","math-ph","hep-th","research","quant-ph","cond-matstat-mech","cond-matstr-el","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":229,"author":"Zhiyuan Wang","raw_content_length":1665,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.145,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["R$-parapar","R$-paraparticles","only $R$-paraparticles"]},"char_count":1664,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a hierarchy","Secret communication games","quasiparticle statistics","3 1D topological phases","arXiv251011818v1 Announce Type","cross","a family","secret communication challenge games","emergent quasiparticle statistics","three-dimensional 3D topological phases"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a hierarchy":3.0,"Secret communication games":2.0,"quasiparticle statistics":2.0,"3 1D topological phases":2.0,"arXiv251011818v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"a family":1.0,"secret communication challenge games":1.0,"emergent quasiparticle statistics":1.0,"three-dimensional 3D topological phases":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7602991880555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.9225,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7845,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8405,"joy":0.0806,"surprise":0.0582,"sadness":0.0028,"fear":0.0028,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes theoretical research into quasiparticle statistics and their potential use in secret communication.

We present a complete classification of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the 30 brane tilings whose toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds are given by the 16 reflexive polygons in 2 dimensions. For each dimer integrable system associated to a reflexive polygon, we present the Casimirs, the single Hamiltonian built from 1-loops, the spectral curve, and the Poisson commutation relations. We also identify all birational equivalences between dimer integrable systems in this classification by presenting the birational transformations that match the Casimirs and the Hamiltonians as well as the spectral curves and Poisson structures between equivalent dimer integrable systems. In total, we identify 16 pairs of birationally equivalent dimer integrable systems which combined with Seiberg duality between the corresponding brane tilings form 5 distinct equivalence classes. Echoing phenomena observed for brane brick models realizing a family of 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, we illustrate that deformations of brane tilings, including mass deformations, correspond to the birational transformations we discover in this work, and leave invariant the number of generators of the mesonic moduli space as well as the corresponding U(1)R-refined Hilbert series.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12290","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.074257","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","mathag","hep-th","research","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Minsung Kho, Norton Lee, Rak-Kyeong Seong","raw_content_length":1526,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dimer Integrable Systems for Reflexive Polygons arXiv:2510.12290v1 Announce Type:","Casimirs"],"persons":["Calabi-Yau 3-folds","Brane"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1525,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Classification","Birational Equivalence","Dimer Integrable Systems","Reflexive Polygons","Announce Type","cross","Brane tilings","bipartite periodic graphs","the 2-torus","a large family"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Classification":2.0,"Birational Equivalence":2.0,"Dimer Integrable Systems":2.0,"Reflexive Polygons":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Brane tilings":1.0,"bipartite periodic graphs":1.0,"the 2-torus":1.0,"a large family":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7604969163888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.886,"joy":0.019,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.0206,"anger":0.0296,"disgust":0.0147},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on dimer integrable systems and their relation to supersymmetric gauge theories.

In practice, however, there may be missing covariates that are not necessarily confounders, and it remains uncertain whether these missing covariates should be included for learning optimal ITRs. In this paper, we propose a covariate-balancing doubly robust estimator for constructing optimal ITRs, which is particularly suitable for situations with additional predictive covariates. The proposed method is based on two main steps: First, the propensity scores are estimated by solving the covariate-balancing equation. Second, an objective function is minimized to estimate the outcome model, with the function defined by the asymptotic variance under the correctly specified propensity score. The method has three significant advantages: (i) It is doubly robust, ensuring consistency when either the propensity score or outcome model is correctly specified. (ii) It minimizes variance within the class of augmented inverse probability weighted estimators. (iii) When applied to partially observed covariates related to the outcome, the method may further improve estimation efficiency. We demonstrate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations and two real-world datasets.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12321","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.074686","language":"en","tags":["mathst","preprints","mathematics","research","statme","statth","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":206,"author":"Yue Zhang, Shanshan Luo, Zhi Geng, Yangbo He","raw_content_length":1523,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.03,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Optimal Treatment Rules","ITR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1522,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimal Treatment Rules","Missing Predictive Covariates","A Covariate","Announce Type","precision medicine","the most important problems","the optimal individualized treatment rules","ITR","which","treatment decisions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimal Treatment Rules":2.0,"Missing Predictive Covariates":2.0,"A Covariate":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"precision medicine":1.0,"the most important problems":1.0,"the optimal individualized treatment rules":1.0,"ITR":1.0,"which":1.0,"treatment decisions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760511381666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.024,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4048,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8046,"joy":0.0027,"surprise":0.0139,"sadness":0.0217,"fear":0.0935,"anger":0.0263,"disgust":0.0372},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a method for improving individualized treatment rules in precision medicine, focusing on handling missing covariate data.

Which of the two populations is synchronised depends on the initial conditions. We show that this deterministic model exhibits random switches of their chimera states, alternating between which of the two populations is synchronised and which is not. We show that these random switches are induced by the finite size of the network. We provide numerical evidence that the switches are governed by a Poisson process and that the time between switches grows exponentially with the system size, rendering switches unobservable for all practical purposes in sufficiently large networks. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the synchronised population, based on a central limit theorem controlling the collective effect of the desynchronised population on the synchronised one, and show that this stochastic model well reproduces the statistical behaviour of the full deterministic model. We further determine critical fluctuation sizes capable of inducing switches and provide estimates for the mean switching times from an associated Kramers problem.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12342","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.075095","language":"en","tags":["mathds","preprints","mathematics","nlinao","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":184,"author":"Henry Irvine, Georg A.

Birkhoff and J. von Neumann. This program is generally disregarded due to no-go theorems restricting the existence of the tensor product of elementary quantum logics and, above all, the impossibility of considering entangled states and Bell non-local states within the framework of these composite quantum logics. We revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality.

On the atomic scale, these strong-field processes are described in terms of highly-oscillatory time integrals which are often approximated using saddle-point methods. These methods simultaneously simplify the calculations and let us understand the physical processes in terms of semi-classical electron trajectories, or quantum orbits. However, applying saddle-point methods for HHG driven by polychromatic laser fields without clear dynamical symmetries has remained challenging. Here we introduce Picard-Lefschetz theory as a universal and robust link between the time integrals and the semi-classical trajectories. The continuous deformation of the integration contour towards so-called Lefschetz thimbles allows an exact evaluation of the integral, as well as the identification of relevant quantum orbits, for arbitrary driving fields. The latter is realised via the ``necklace algorithm'', a novel solution to the open problem of determining the relevance of saddle points for a two-dimensional integral, which we introduce here. We demonstrate the versatility and rigour of Picard-Lefschetz methods by studying Stokes transitions and spectral caustics arising in HHG driven by two-colour laser fields. For example, we showcase a quantum-orbit analysis of the colour switchover, which links the regime of perturbative two-colour fields with that of fully bichromatic driving fields. With this work, we set the foundation for a rigorous application of quantum-orbit based approaches in attosecond science that enables the interpretation of state-of-the-art experimental setups, and guides the design of future ones.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12545","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.078358","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","research","quant-ph","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":260,"author":"Anne Weber, Job Feldbrugge, Emilio Pisanty","raw_content_length":1890,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HHG"],"persons":["Picard-Lefschetz"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1889,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A universal approach","arXiv251012545v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Light-matter interactions","the strong-field regime","intense laser fields","a target","tunnelling","rise"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A universal approach":2.0,"arXiv251012545v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Light-matter interactions":1.0,"the strong-field regime":1.0,"intense laser fields":1.0,"a target":1.0,"tunnelling":1.0,"rise":1.0}},"age_hours":2.760642877777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6776,"joy":0.094,"surprise":0.1578,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0266,"anger":0.0272,"disgust":0.0101},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel theoretical method (Picard-Lefschetz theory) for analyzing light-matter interactions in strong laser fields.

By reformulating the problem in terms of the transverse intersection of some submanifolds in the phase space of flat ${\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ connections, we demonstrate that the Hessian is non-degenerate for critical points corresponding to non-degenerate, geometric 4-simplices in de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space. Non-degeneracy of the Hessian is an important necessary condition for the stationary phase method to be applicable. With a non-degenerate Hessian, this method not only confirms the connection of the $\\Lambda$-SF model to semiclassical gravity, but also shows that there are no dominant contributions from exceptional configurations as in the Barrett-Crane model. Given its general nature, we expect our criterion to be applicable to other spinfoam models under mild adjustments.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12755","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.081148","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathmp","mathematics","gr-qc","hep-th","research","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Wojciech Kami\\'nski, Qiaoyin Pan","raw_content_length":1076,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hessian","\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$"],"persons":["arXiv:2510.12755v1 Announce Type"],"locations":["de Sitter"],"monetary":["\\Lambda$-SF"]},"char_count":1075,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the spinfoam models","Hessian","cosmological constant","the Hessian","arXiv251012755v1","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","this paper","a general method"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the spinfoam models":3.0,"Hessian":2.0,"cosmological constant":2.0,"the Hessian":2.0,"arXiv251012755v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"a general method":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7607381308333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.9905000000000004,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4019,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7883,"joy":0.0686,"surprise":0.08,"sadness":0.0091,"fear":0.0083,"anger":0.032,"disgust":0.0137},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical method for proving the non-degeneracy of the Hessian in spinfoam models for quantum gravity.

Medical imaging techniques can generate large point cloud datasets that capture changes in the cellular composition of such tissues with disease progression. However, regions of interest (ROIs) are usually defined by quadrat-based methods that ignore intrinsic structure and risk fragmenting meaningful features. Here, we introduce TopROI, a topology-informed, network-based method for partitioning point clouds into ROIs that preserves both local geometry and higher-order architecture. TopROI integrates geometry-informed networks with persistent homology, combining cell neighbourhoods and multiscale cycles to guide community detection. Applied to synthetic point clouds that mimic glandular structure, TopROI outperforms quadrat-based and purely geometric partitions by maintaining biologically plausible ROI geometry and better preserving ground-truth structures. Applied to cellular point clouds obtained from human colorectal cancer biopsies, TopROI generates ROIs that preserve crypt-like structures and enable persistent homology analysis of individual regions. This study reveals a continuum of architectural changes from healthy mucosa to carcinoma, reflecting progressive disorganisation in tissue structure. TopROI thus provides a principled and flexible framework for defining biologically meaningful ROIs in large point clouds, enabling more accurate quantification of tissue organization and new insights into structural changes associated with disease progression.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12772","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.081567","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathat","mathematics","research","q-bioqm","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Sergio Serrano de Haro Iv\\'a\\~nez, Joshua W.

This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction.

We investigate the energy landscape in dependence of the size of the 'charge', i.e. the weight of the Riesz interaction energy. In the two-dimensional case we first prove that for simply connected sets of small elastic energy, the elastic deficit controls the isoperimetric deficit. Building on this result, we show that for small charge the only minimizers of the full variational model are either balls or centered annuli. We complement these statements by a non-existence result for large charge. In three dimensions, we prove area and diameter bounds for configurations with small Willmore energy and show that balls are the unique minimizers of our variational model for sufficiently small charge.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01418","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.084275","language":"en","tags":["mathap","preprints","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Michael Goldman (LJLL), Matteo Novaga, Matthias R\\\"oger","raw_content_length":1046,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Riesz"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1045,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantitative estimates","energies","applications","non","Announce Type","Abstract","a variational model","a weighted sum","perimeter","bending and Riesz interaction energies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantitative estimates":2.0,"energies":2.0,"applications":2.0,"non":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a variational model":1.0,"a weighted sum":1.0,"perimeter":1.0,"bending and Riesz interaction energies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7608439025,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8788,"joy":0.0186,"surprise":0.0676,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0164,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical mathematical modeling of elastic drops, which could potentially inform the design of materials or structures relevant to sustainability.

Such inequalities are hard to verify purely analytically, and in this work we develop approximation schemes to verify some of the arising frequency inequalities. Besides some general theoretical results, in applications we stick to the case of scalar equations. By means of the Suarez--Schopf delayed oscillator and the Mackey--Glass equations, we demonstrate applications of the theory to reveal regions in the space of parameters where the absence of closed invariant contours can be guaranteed.

Identifiability is represented by the closeness of the posterior to the prior distribution and falsifiability by the power of posterior predictive tests against alternatives. To study these two concepts formally, we develop information-theoretic proxies, which we term the identifiability and falsifiability mutual information. We argue that these are useful indicators, with lower values indicating a risk of poor parameter inference and underpowered model checks, respectively. Our main result establishes that a sufficiently complex expansion of a base statistical model forces a trade-off between these two mutual information quantities -- at least one of the two must decrease relative to the base model.

The well-definedness of their construction depended on their conjecture that this category has finite cohomological dimension. This was disproven by R. Bezrukavnikov and A.

In the same paper, Polishchuk then made an alternative conjecture: though this counterexample shows that the Grothendieck group $K_0(\\mathcal{A})$ is not spanned by objects of finite projective dimension, he noted that a graded version of $K_0(\\mathcal{A})$ can be thought of as a module over Laurent polynomials and conjectured that a certain localization of this module is generated by objects of finite projective dimension, and suggested that this conjecture could lead toward a proof that Kazhdan and Laumon's construction is well-defined. He proved this conjecture in Types $A_1, A_2, A_3$, and $B_2$.

In the classical realm of Riemannian geometry, informally, if two manifolds are close in the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and belong to a class of manifolds with bounded curvature and diameter, then the spectra of their Laplacian or Dirac operators are also close under many scenari. Of particular interest is the case where a sequence of manifolds converge for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance to a manifold of lower dimension, and the question of the continuity, in some sense, of the spectra of geometrically relevant operators. In this paper, we initiate the study of the continuity of spectra and other properties of metric spectral triples under collapse in the noncommutative realm. As a first step in this study, we work with collapse for the spectral propinquity, an analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance for spectral triples introduced by the second author, i.e. a form of metric for differential structures. Inspired by results from collapse in Riemannian geometry, we begin with the study of spectral triples which decompose, in some sense, in a vertical and a horizontal direction, and we collapse these spectral triples along the vertical direction. We obtain convergence results, and by the work of the second author, we conclude continuity results for the spectra of the Dirac operators of these spectral triples. Examples include collapse of product of spectral triples with one Abelian factor, $U(1)$ principal bundles over Riemannian spin manifolds, and noncommutative principal bundles, including C*-crossed-products and other noncommutative bundles.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00240","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.096234","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathoa","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":263,"author":"Carla Farsi, Frederic Latremoliere","raw_content_length":1743,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.315,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Gromov-Hausdorff","Spectral Continuity arXiv:2404.00240v2 Announce Type","Collapse","Noncommutative Geometry"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1742,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Collapse","Noncommutative Geometry","Spectral Continuity","arXiv240400240v2 Announce Type","Abstract","two compact quantum metric spaces","the metric sense","noncommutative spaces","the classical realm","Riemannian geometry"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Collapse":2.0,"Noncommutative Geometry":2.0,"Spectral Continuity":2.0,"arXiv240400240v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"two compact quantum metric spaces":1.0,"the metric sense":1.0,"noncommutative spaces":1.0,"the classical realm":1.0,"Riemannian geometry":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7612442730555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.5305,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7021,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.2298,"sadness":0.0086,"fear":0.0248,"anger":0.019,"disgust":0.0102},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the theoretical continuity of spectra in noncommutative geometry under collapse, inspired by Riemannian geometry.

Suppose the validity of the classical Isaacs' condition and the existence of a (what is termed) quasi-strong solution to the Bellman-Isaacs (BI) equations. If the diffusion coefficient of the state equation is non-degenerate, we are able to show the existence of a saddle point constituted by a couple of feedback controls that achieve the value of the game: moreover, the latter is equal to the (necessarily unique) solution of the BI equations. A suitable generalization is available when the diffusion is possibly degenerate. Similarly we have also improved a well-known verification theorem in stochastic control theory. The techniques of stochastic calculus via regularization we use, in particular specific chain rules, are borrowed from a companion paper of the authors.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06243","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.099264","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathematics","mathoc","research","mathpr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Carlo Ciccarella (OC, ENSTA Paris), Francesco Russo (OC, ENSTA Paris)","raw_content_length":1070,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.795,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Bellman-Isaacs"],"persons":[],"locations":["Nash"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1069,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Verification theorem","a zero sum stochastic differential game","a chain rule","arXiv240706243v3 Announce Type","Abstract","the framework","stochastic zero-sum differential games","a verification theorem","those","stochastic control"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a chain rule"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Verification theorem":2.0,"a zero sum stochastic differential game":2.0,"a chain rule":2.0,"arXiv240706243v3 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the framework":1.0,"stochastic zero-sum differential games":1.0,"a verification theorem":1.0,"those":1.0,"stochastic control":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7613513355555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.4695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4939,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6438,"joy":0.1698,"surprise":0.1582,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0053,"anger":0.0125,"disgust":0.0026},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on theoretical mathematical proofs related to stochastic differential games and control theory.

Previous research has demonstrated that the performance of accelerated first-order methods is more sensitive to gradient errors compared with non-accelerated ones. This paper investigates the nonasymptotic convergence bound of two accelerated methods with inexact gradients to solve deterministic smooth convex problems. Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) is used as the primary tool to analyze the convergence bounds of the underlying algorithms. By finding an analytical solution to PEP, we derive novel convergence bounds of Generalized Optimized Gradient Method (GOGM) and Generalized Fast Gradient Method (GFGM) with inexact gradient oracles following the absolute error bound. The derived bounds allow varying oracle inexactness along the iterations; furthermore, their accumulated error terms are independent of the initial condition and any unknown parameters. Furthermore, we analyze the tradeoff between the vanishing term and the accumulated error in the convergence bound that guides finding the optimal stepsize. Finally, we determine the optimal strategy to set the gradient inexactness along iterations (if possible in a given application), ensuring that the accumulated error remains subordinate to the vanishing term.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00720","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.101294","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathoc","mathematics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Yin Liu, Sam Davanloo Tajbakhsh","raw_content_length":1501,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GOGM","Generalized Fast Gradient Method","Nonasymptotic Analysis of Accelerated Methods With Inexact Oracle","Generalized Optimized Gradient Method","Performance Estimation Problem"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1500,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Nonasymptotic Analysis","Accelerated Methods","Inexact Oracle","Absolute Error Bound","arXiv240800720v2 Announce Type","Abstract","Performance analysis","first-order algorithms","inexact oracles","recent attention"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["first-order algorithms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Nonasymptotic Analysis":2.0,"Accelerated Methods":2.0,"Inexact Oracle":2.0,"Absolute Error Bound":2.0,"arXiv240800720v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Performance analysis":1.0,"first-order algorithms":1.0,"inexact oracles":1.0,"recent attention":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7614167083333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.194,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3612,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8546,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.089,"sadness":0.0076,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0171,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of optimization algorithms, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by reducing computational costs in various applications, including climate modeling or renewable energy optimization.
