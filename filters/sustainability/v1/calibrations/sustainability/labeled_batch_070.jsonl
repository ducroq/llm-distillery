{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_257d4f3e447c","title":"On-Policy RL Meets Off","content":"arXiv:2508.11408v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established response patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for Controllable Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from the expert, which promotes on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning problems and practical tool-use tasks, providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over baselines. We release the implementation at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to inspire further research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11408","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.907315","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Wenhao Zhang, Yuexiang Xie, Yuchang Sun, Yanxi Chen, Guoyin Wang, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou","raw_content_length":1720,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CHORD","Reinforcement Learning","Large Language Models","SFT","Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning"],"persons":["Dynamic Weighting","RL Meets Off"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1719,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["On-Policy RL","SFT","arXiv250811408v2","Announce Type","Abstract","Supervised Fine-Tuning SFT","Reinforcement Learning","two prominent post-training paradigms","the capabilities","the behavior"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"On-Policy RL":2.0,"SFT":2.0,"arXiv250811408v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Supervised Fine-Tuning SFT":1.0,"Reinforcement Learning":1.0,"two prominent post-training paradigms":1.0,"the capabilities":1.0,"the behavior":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7728633666666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6249,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6486,"joy":0.0047,"surprise":0.018,"sadness":0.0166,"fear":0.2771,"anger":0.0253,"disgust":0.0097},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework (CHORD) to improve the training of large language models.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c8eee546dd77","title":"Eerste zeven gijzelaars vrijgelaten door Hamas, 1966 Palestijnse gevangenen onderweg","content":"De eerste Israëlische gijzelaars zijn in het noorden van Gaza vrijgelaten door Hamas. Zeven mensen zijn door het Rode Kruis opgevangen en overgedragen aan Israël, binnenkort worden ze met hun familie herenigd. Ook bijna 2000 Palestijnse gevangenen zijn onderweg naar vrijheid. Bekijk hier de eerste beelden: Het moment van de vrijlating van de gijzelaars vond buiten het zicht van de camera's plaats. Op het 'Gijzelaarsplein' in Tel Aviv klonk gejuich op het moment dat het bericht kwam van de vrijlating. Hoe de gijzelaars eraan toe zijn, is niet bekend. Liveblog Volg de laatste ontwikkelingen over de vrijlating van de Israëlische gijzelaars en de Palestijnse gevangenen ook in ons liveblog. Vanochtend vroeg publiceerde Hamas een lijst met de namen van twintig levende gijzelaars die worden vrijgelaten. Volgens de Israëlische zender Channel12 worden de levende gijzelaars in twee groepen vrijgelaten. De tweede groep, waarvan nog onduidelijk is hoeveel mensen dat precies zijn, zou in principe rond 09.00 uur Nederlandse tijd worden vrijgelaten. Onder de twintig mannen die worden vrijgelaten zijn meerdere bezoekers en bewakers van het Nova-festival, enkele soldaten en bewoners van kibboetsen die door Hamas werden overvallen. Het zijn voornamelijk twintigers en dertigers. Onder hen zijn bijvoorbeeld twee broers en een tweeling, een Servisch-Duitse Israëliër en verschillende gijzelaars die de afgelopen tijd door Hamas werden gefilmd voor propagandavideo's, zoals een gijzelaar die zei zijn eigen graf te hebben gegraven. Vrijlating Palestijnse gevangenen Vanochtend kwamen ook de eerste bussen aan bij Israëlische gevangenissen. Palestijnse gevangenen stappen in de bussen om naar Gaza te worden gebracht. Volgens een bron die persbureau Reuters citeert zijn alle 1966 Palestijnen in bussen gestapt om vandaag vrijgelaten te worden. Nadat de Israëlische gijzelaars in Israël waren aangekomen, zijn de bussen gaan rijden. 250 Palestijnen die een levenslange gevangenisstraf hadden gekregen, worden op de Westelijke Jordaanoever, Jeruzalem en in het buitenland vrijgelaten. De andere 1716 worden naar het Nasser-ziekenhuis in Gaza gebracht. Vorige week bereikten Israël en Hamas een akkoord over een eerste fase van een plan van de Amerikaanse president Trump om de oorlog in Gaza te stoppen. De eerste fase bestaat uit een wapenstilstand, vrijlating van Israëlische gijzelaars en Palestijnse gevangenen en gedeeltelijke terugtrekking van Israël uit Gaza. Later wordt verder gesproken over de ontwapening van Hamas en uiteindelijk de opbouw van een nieuw bestuur in de Gazastrook, zonder Hamas. Nasrah Habiballah, correspondent Israël en Palestijnse gebieden: \"Onder Israëliërs is er veel blijdschap en opluchting. We zien beelden van familieleden die in spanning zitten te wachten. Dit is iets waar ze twee jaar lang op hebben gewacht. Sommigen kunnen niet geloven dat deze dag is aangebroken. De sfeer is heel erg uitgelaten: er wordt gejuicht, geklapt en iedereen is heel erg emotioneel. Toen de deal al rond was, en in de dagen erna, werd ook door bepaalde familieleden van de gijzelaars gezegd: 'We moeten nog geen feest vieren, het is nog niet zover. Er kan nog van alles misgaan op het laatste moment.' De verwachting is wel dat in ieder geval de levende gijzelaars worden vrijgelaten, maar toch blijft het spannend voor de familieleden. Die zijn pas echt opgelucht als ze hun geliefden in hun armen kunnen sluiten. De Amerikaanse president Trump wordt gezien als de held die dit voor elkaar heeft gekregen, omdat het hem is na twee jaar gelukt om de gijzelaars vrij te krijgen. Overal zie je Amerikaanse vlaggen, ook voor bezoek van Trump aan het Israëlische parlement vandaag, die daar een speech gaat geven. Langs de snelwegen staan billboards met foto's van Trump met de tekst eronder: \"Trump, dankjewel.\" Dat is het gevoel dat veel mensen hier hebben. Premier Netanyahu zien mensen hier niet als een held. Israëliërs nemen het hem juist heel erg kwalijk dat hij er twee jaar over heeft gedaan om de gijzelaars vrij te krijgen. Veel mensen hebben het gevoel dat hij andere doelen boven dat doel gesteld heeft.\"","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586282","published_date":"2025-10-13T05:20:58","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:39:33.531645","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":641,"author":null,"raw_content_length":4548,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":3.205,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Hamas","Tel Aviv"],"locations":["Gijzelaarsplein","Gaza","Israël"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4130,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["gijzelaars","De eerste Israëlische gijzelaars","het noorden","mensen","hun familie","vrijheid","de eerste beelden","Het moment","de vrijlating","de gijzelaars"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"gijzelaars":2.0,"De eerste Israëlische gijzelaars":1.0,"het noorden":1.0,"mensen":1.0,"hun familie":1.0,"vrijheid":1.0,"de eerste beelden":1.0,"Het moment":1.0,"de vrijlating":1.0,"de gijzelaars":1.0}},"age_hours":1.4052870194444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3635,"joy":0.017,"surprise":0.0557,"sadness":0.0399,"fear":0.3313,"anger":0.112,"disgust":0.0806},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":8,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a political agreement leading to the release of hostages and prisoners.

Hier vind je het overzicht van wegwerkzaamheden en hier lees je waar werkzaamheden en storingen zijn op het spoor. Wat kun je vandaag verwachten? Wat heb je gemist? Het ministerie van Economische Zaken heeft ingegrepen bij chipfabrikant Nexperia, uit vrees dat cruciale technologische kennis en capaciteiten verdwijnen uit Nederland en Europa. Volgens het demissionaire kabinet waren er \"acute signalen van ernstige bestuurlijke tekortkomingen en handelingen\" bij het chipbedrijf. Het ministerie wil daar verder geen details over geven. De Chinese Nexperia-topman Zhang Xuezheng is door de Ondernemingskamer van het gerechtshof in Amsterdam uit zijn functie gezet, blijkt uit stukken van de Chinese Nexperia-eigenaar Wingtech.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_953a22613fb0","title":"Aantal uitleveringen stijgt: 'Dubai geen veilige haven meer voor criminelen'","content":"De afgelopen anderhalf jaar hebben de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten elf verdachten uitgeleverd aan Nederland, terwijl daarvoor zelden iemand werd overgedragen. Criminelen in Dubai worden nerveus, merkt het Openbaar Ministerie. Jarenlang konden Nederlandse criminelen ongestoord een luxeleven leiden in de emiraten. Vele tientallen verdachten hielden zich schuil in Dubai, buiten het bereik van justitie in Nederland. Terwijl ze vanuit het Midden-Oosten per versleutelde telefoon cocaïnetransporten organiseerden, deelden drugshandelaren met hetzelfde gemak opdrachten uit voor liquidaties in Nederland. Hun geld staken ze in dure auto's, luxe appartementen en uitspattingen in het nachtleven van Dubai. Deze Arabische vrijhaven was Nederland een doorn in het oog. Daarom kwamen er gesprekken over officiële rechtshulp met de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten en werd uiteindelijk in 2023 een uitleveringsverdrag van kracht. Vorig jaar werden de eerste drie verdachten overhandigd, dit jaar tot nu toe acht. \"Dit is geen piek, maar de nieuwe trend\", stelt officier van justitie Ferry van Veghel van het Landelijk Parket, dat regelmatig om uitlevering vraagt van verdachten in de emiraten. Drugshandel Eerder moest de overheid nog lang onderhandelen om Nederlands meest gezochte verdachte Ridouan Taghi hierheen te krijgen. Maar inmiddels zijn de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten criminelen liever kwijt dan rijk en vliegen ze er achter elkaar uit. Onder de nu uitgeleverde elf zijn verdachten van zware georganiseerde criminaliteit, zoals drugshandel en witwassen. Voorbeelden zijn een zoon van Taghi, voetballer Quincy Promes, de Delftse rapper Fatah en een ondergrondse bankier die miljoenen zou hebben verplaatst voor criminelen. \"Maar ook verdachten in zaken die misschien van minder gewicht lijken, zoals cybercrime of fraude met cryptovaluta\", zegt Van Veghel. \"Omdat heel duidelijk moet zijn dat wat je ook gepleegd hebt, naar Dubai gaan betekent niet meer dat je buiten schot blijft.\" Verdachten die nog op het lijstje van het OM staan om uitgeleverd te worden zijn onder andere de Bredase drugsbaron Edin G., een gewelddadige Eritrese mensenhandelaar en een man die naar Dubai is gevlucht na het veroorzaken van een dodelijk verkeersongeval in Lelystad. Geduld Eerder was de procedure ondoorzichtig en onvoorspelbaar. Inmiddels weet het Openbaar Ministerie beter hoe een uitleveringsverzoek onderbouwd moet worden. Sinds dit jaar zit er een Nederlandse officier van justitie in de emiraten om de samenwerking te bevorderen. Toch blijft uitleveren een oefening in geduld. De procedure kan zomaar een jaar tot anderhalf jaar duren, zoals blijkt uit de zaak rond Promes. Lang bleef onduidelijk of hij hier zijn straf zou gaan uitzitten. Net als in Nederland, kan een verdachte zich verzetten tegen uitlevering en in beroep gaan tegen een beslissing van de rechter. Uiteindelijk moet de minister van Justitie beslissen. Hoewel het OM nu meer te horen krijgt over het verloop van een procedure, blijft het vaak een verrassing wanneer een verdachte daadwerkelijk kan worden opgehaald. Wie zich niet verzet tegen uitlevering, kan tegenwoordig snel in Nederland zijn. Dat bewees de arrestatie van vlogger Alex Soze, die hier nog een gevangenisstraf open heeft staan voor geweld en op sociale media koketteerde met zijn verblijf in Dubai. In augustus werd hij op verzoek van Nederland opgepakt, een paar weken later was hij hier. Deal sluiten Nog altijd zitten er vermoedelijk tientallen Nederlandse verdachten in de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten. Die beginnen zenuwachtig te worden, merkt het OM. \"Het is een plek waar het goed toeven is en tot op heden misschien ook heel veilig voelde\", zegt Van Veghel. \"Ik denk wel dat dat echt voorbij is.\" Het OM zegt steeds vaker te worden gebeld door advocaten van verdachten in Dubai, die procesafspraken willen maken met justitie om hier een straf uit te zitten. \"Dat verdachten nu zelf contact opnemen om naar Nederland terug te komen, bewijst voor ons wel dat ze zich niet langer veilig wanen.\" Er zijn ook verdachten die inmiddels uit Dubai zijn vertrokken omdat het hen er te heet onder de voeten werd. Er gaan zelfs verhalen over criminelen die verborgen in zeecontainers de emiraten ontvluchten. Marokko De vraag is waar ze dan naartoe gaan; buiten bereik van justitie maar waar ze het ook breed kunnen laten hangen.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_c2ac7d0625fa","title":"Nieuw Frans kabinet aangetreden, zware eerste week verwacht","content":"Frankrijk heeft een nieuw kabinet. De oude en nieuwe premier Sébastien Lecornu presenteerde gisteravond zijn ministersploeg, die als doel heeft om voor het einde van het jaar een nieuwe begroting door het parlement te loodsen. De tijd daarvoor dringt. Lecornu diende vorige week na nog geen maand zijn ontslag in. President Macron vroeg hem enkele dagen later opnieuw om premier te worden en een kabinet te vormen. Daarin houden enkele belangrijke ministers hun post, onder wie Macrons vertrouweling Roland Lescure als minister van Financiën en Economische Zaken. De politiechef van Parijs wordt minister van Binnenlandse Zaken. Nieuwe begroting Vanwege wettelijke termijnen voor de parlementaire behandeling van een begroting is het zaak dat de Franse regering zo snel mogelijk een begroting indient. Anders kan die niet voor het einde van het jaar kan worden goedgekeurd. Daarvoor is wel eerst kabinetsberaad nodig. Omdat president Macron vandaag meedoet aan de Gazatop in Egypte, kan het kabinet pas dinsdag voor het eerst met Macron bijeenkomen. Volgens Macrons kantoor moet de begroting woensdag klaar zijn. Motie van wantrouwen? Deze week dreigt ook een nieuwe motie van wantrouwen tegen Lecornu en zijn kabinet. Het is niet zeker of hij die overleeft. Het kabinet kan niet leunen op een meerderheid in het parlement. Wel zijn enkele partijen bereid tot gedoogsteun in ruil voor concessies bij beleid. Zo verwachten de socialisten onder meer dat pensioenhervormingen van tafel gaan.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586274","published_date":"2025-10-13T02:29:09","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:39:33.535562","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":230,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1604,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Sébastien Lecornu","Roland Lescure","Lecornu","Macrons"],"locations":["Parijs","Frankrijk"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1488,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Frans kabinet","zware eerste week","een nieuw kabinet","De oude en nieuwe premier","zijn ministersploeg","die","doel","het einde","het jaar","een nieuwe begroting"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Frans kabinet":2.0,"zware eerste week":2.0,"een nieuw kabinet":1.0,"De oude en nieuwe premier":1.0,"zijn ministersploeg":1.0,"die":1.0,"doel":1.0,"het einde":1.0,"het jaar":1.0,"een nieuwe begroting":1.0}},"age_hours":4.268945830833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.0029999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5994,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6276,"joy":0.0191,"surprise":0.1155,"sadness":0.0521,"fear":0.0653,"anger":0.0568,"disgust":0.0636},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":3,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":7,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":3,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses the formation of a new French cabinet and their immediate priority of passing a new budget.
