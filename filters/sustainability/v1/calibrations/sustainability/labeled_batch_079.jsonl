{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8fd9d92f16c6","title":"Accent","content":"arXiv:2510.09528v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource, linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity.

Existing FPN-based methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements, but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp (ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized rearrangement and convolution.

Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and multilingual robustness evaluation.

Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however, extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING (FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications - including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing - show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster convergence.

However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09544","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.769848","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Qiguang Chen, Hanjing Li, Libo Qin, Dengyun Peng, Jinhao Liu, Jiangyi Wang, Chengyue Wu, Xie Chen, Yantao Du, Wanxiang Che","raw_content_length":1356,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PSC","Parallel-Sequential Contradiction"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1355,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Surface Reasoning","the True Long Chain","arXiv251009544v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Diffusion Large Language Models","DLLMs","high throughput","effective sequential reasoning","them","autoregressive LLMs"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the True Long Chain","Diffusion Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Surface Reasoning":2.0,"the True Long Chain":2.0,"arXiv251009544v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Diffusion Large Language Models":1.0,"DLLMs":1.0,"high throughput":1.0,"effective sequential reasoning":1.0,"them":1.0,"autoregressive LLMs":1.0}},"age_hours":2.768045271111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.08,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.184,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.886,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.0474,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0127,"anger":0.0253,"disgust":0.0122},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper identifies limitations in Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) related to parallel processing and reasoning tasks.

We tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025 M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language.

We flip this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time, there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type, with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09556","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.772227","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Daniel Brubaker, William Sheffield, Junyi Jessy Li, Kanishka Misra","raw_content_length":1166,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Discourse Connectives arXiv:2510.09556v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1165,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["WUGNECTIVES","LMs","Novel Entity Inferences","Language Models","Discourse Connectives","arXiv251009556v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The role","world knowledge","the discourse relation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"WUGNECTIVES":3.0,"LMs":3.0,"Novel Entity Inferences":2.0,"Language Models":2.0,"Discourse Connectives":2.0,"arXiv251009556v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The role":1.0,"world knowledge":1.0,"the discourse relation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.768138630833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9183,"joy":0.0239,"surprise":0.0347,"sadness":0.003,"fear":0.0056,"anger":0.0098,"disgust":0.0046},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a dataset (WUGNECTIVES) and analyzes the ability of language models to infer world knowledge from discourse connectives.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability, then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query signals, boosting performance in dense settings.

We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement.

Here, we present a comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440 Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional \"knocking\" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3, respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration.

However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' - the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09577","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.775524","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Xiao Yu, Baolin Peng, Michel Galley, Hao Cheng, Qianhui Wu, Janardhan Kulkarni, Suman Nath, Zhou Yu, Jianfeng Gao","raw_content_length":1832,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Dyna-Mind","ReSim"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1831,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dyna","math","arXiv251009577v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Reasoning models","remarkable progress","domains","coding","However their expert-level abilities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["domains"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dyna":2.0,"math":2.0,"arXiv251009577v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Reasoning models":1.0,"remarkable progress":1.0,"domains":1.0,"coding":1.0,"However their expert-level abilities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.768265150833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8282,"joy":0.0112,"surprise":0.0753,"sadness":0.0049,"fear":0.0537,"anger":0.0197,"disgust":0.007},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel AI framework (Dyna-Mind) that enhances reasoning in AI agents through simulation.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_18deff3aa5aa","title":"GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data","content":"arXiv:2510.09580v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines. Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual (with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g., Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09580","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.775949","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":261,"author":"Margarita Belova, Jiaxin Xiao, Shikhar Tuli, Niraj K.

We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision. Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in low-shot and open-set scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09583","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.776358","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Shubham Trehan, Udhav Ramachandran, Akash Rao, Ruth Scimeca, Sathyanarayanan N.

Titles and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2) steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs, parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones; contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to enable auditing and extension.

Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans, is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity, real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a \"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate \"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process. Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench.

Existing models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness, and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+ datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30 archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity, demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\\% of the full-model performance while offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming uniform and clustering-based compression baselines.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2e7b9d918c82","title":"MODE: Learning compositional representations of complex systems with Mixtures Of Dynamical Experts","content":"arXiv:2510.09594v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular, posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology. First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding challenge in computational biology.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09594","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.779141","language":"en","tags":["q-biomn","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":218,"author":"Nathan Quiblier, Roy Friedman, Matthew Ricci","raw_content_length":1606,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.09,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MODE","Dynamical","Mixtures Of Dynamical Experts arXiv:2510.09594v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1605,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MODE","compositional representations","complex systems","Mixtures","Dynamical Experts","arXiv251009594v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Dynamical systems","the life sciences","complex mixtures"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["MODE"],"business_innovation":["MODE"],"research_academic":["the life sciences"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MODE":2.0,"compositional representations":2.0,"complex systems":2.0,"Mixtures":2.0,"Dynamical Experts":2.0,"arXiv251009594v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Dynamical systems":1.0,"the life sciences":1.0,"complex mixtures":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7684073583333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1351,"joy":0.0037,"surprise":0.0254,"sadness":0.0196,"fear":0.7651,"anger":0.0388,"disgust":0.0123},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel machine learning framework (MODE) for modeling complex biological systems.

Yet, current coding benchmarks face limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility. To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems, each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable 81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile, underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models. Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration.

They work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate, while using fewer reward evaluations.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09596","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.779977","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":209,"author":"Sangyun Lee, Brandon Amos, Giulia Fanti","raw_content_length":1467,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.045,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1466,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Exploration Posteriors","Generative Modeling","Only Negative Rewards","arXiv251009596v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Todays generative models","large amounts","supervised data","informative reward functions","the quality"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Exploration Posteriors":2.0,"Generative Modeling":2.0,"Only Negative Rewards":2.0,"arXiv251009596v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Todays generative models":1.0,"large amounts":1.0,"supervised data":1.0,"informative reward functions":1.0,"the quality":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7684385638888886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.455,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.891,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8817,"joy":0.0666,"surprise":0.0273,"sadness":0.0032,"fear":0.0042,"anger":0.0094,"disgust":0.0077},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm (BaNEL) for improving generative models using only negative rewards, which could potentially reduce the need for large labeled datasets and expensive reward evaluations.

In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09599","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.780425","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","preprints","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Sondos Mahmoud Bsharat, Zhiqiang Shen","raw_content_length":1858,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GPQA-Diamond"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1857,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Test","arXiv251009599v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large language models","LLMs","impressive reasoning capabilities","-thought","large reasoning datasets","this work","Prompting Test-Time Scaling P-TTS"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Test":2.0,"arXiv251009599v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"impressive reasoning capabilities":1.0,"-thought":1.0,"large reasoning datasets":1.0,"this work":1.0,"Prompting Test-Time Scaling P-TTS":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7684543880555554,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8279,"joy":0.0149,"surprise":0.0077,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0672,"anger":0.0424,"disgust":0.032},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a method (P-TTS) to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, potentially leading to more efficient use of computing resources.

This paper aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards.

By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09607","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.781656","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscv","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Shaoqi Dong, Chaoyou Fu, Haihan Gao, Yi-Fan Zhang, Chi Yan, Chu Wu, Xiaoyu Liu, Yunhang Shen, Jing Huo, Deqiang Jiang, Haoyu Cao, Yang Gao, Xing Sun, Ran He, Caifeng Shan","raw_content_length":1916,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.28,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["VLM","VITA arXiv:2510.09607v1 Announce Type","Vision-Language Action"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1915,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["VITA","VLMs","arXiv251009607v1 Announce Type","Vision-Language Action","VLA","robotic manipulation","the strong perception capabilities","pretrained vision-language models","action modules","these pretrained models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["pretrained vision-language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"VITA":2.0,"VLMs":2.0,"arXiv251009607v1 Announce Type":1.0,"Vision-Language Action":1.0,"VLA":1.0,"robotic manipulation":1.0,"the strong perception capabilities":1.0,"pretrained vision-language models":1.0,"action modules":1.0,"these pretrained models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.768501455833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.9225,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7845,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9309,"joy":0.0143,"surprise":0.0185,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0041,"anger":0.0149,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel distillation-based framework for training vision-language action models, achieving improved success rates in robotic manipulation tasks.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1623f1211851","title":"StreamingVLM: Real","content":"arXiv:2510.09608v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_dd101aa76bec","title":"Hamba: Single-view 3D Hand Reconstruction with Graph","content":"arXiv:2407.09646v2 Announce Type: cross Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two Competition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction.

This again can be attributed to online advertising, which has been the main financier to the open web.

Existing methods typically use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video. Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images.

PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

In more detail, given $N$ copies of an $n$-qubit state $\\rho$ which is $\\epsilon$-close to a product mixed state $\\pi$, the goal is to output a nearly-optimal product mixed state approximation to $\\rho$. While there has been a flurry of recent work on agnostic tomography, prior work could only handle pure state ansatz, such as product states or stabilizer states. Here we give an algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states which finds a product state which is $O(\\epsilon \\log 1 / \\epsilon)$ close to $\\rho$ which uses polynomially many copies of $\\rho$, and which runs in polynomial time. Moreover, our algorithm only uses single-qubit, single-copy measurements. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient algorithm that achieves any non-trivial agnostic tomography guarantee for any class of mixed state ansatz. Our algorithm proceeds in two main conceptual steps, which we believe are of independent interest. First, we demonstrate a novel, black-box efficient reduction from agnostic tomography of product mixed states to the classical task of \\emph{robustly learning binary product distributions} -- a textbook problem in robust statistics. We then demonstrate a nearly-optimal efficient algorithm for the classical task of robustly learning a binary product, answering an open problem in the literature. Our approach hinges on developing a new optimal certificate of closeness for binary product distributions that can be leveraged algorithmically via a carefully defined convex relaxation. Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a lower bound demonstrating that adaptivity is information-theoretically necessary for our agnostic tomography task, so long as the algorithm only uses single-qubit two-outcome projective measurements.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08472","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.786487","language":"en","tags":["csds","research","preprints","quant-ph","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":286,"author":"Alvan Arulandu, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel Kane, Jerry Li","raw_content_length":1963,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.43,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Robust Statistics"],"persons":["\\rho$."],"locations":[],"monetary":["$n$-qubit state","O(\\epsilon","\\epsilon$-close"]},"char_count":1960,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Agnostic Product Mixed State Tomography","Robust Statistics","agnostic tomography","Announce Type","Abstract","the problem","emphmixed state ansatz","product mixed states","more detail","N copies"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["more detail"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Agnostic Product Mixed State Tomography":2.0,"Robust Statistics":2.0,"agnostic tomography":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"the problem":1.0,"emphmixed state ansatz":1.0,"product mixed states":1.0,"more detail":1.0,"N copies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7686932497222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.48,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.296,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8984,"joy":0.0152,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0311,"anger":0.0188,"disgust":0.0086},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel algorithm for agnostic tomography of product mixed states, potentially improving the efficiency of quantum computing.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_62999875e0d2","title":"Look before Transcription: End-to","content":"arXiv:2510.08618v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with domain-specific terminology, especially in specialized settings such as academic lectures. To address this, we define the SlideASR task, which leverages the rich visual information from presentation slides to improve transcription accuracy. Existing pipeline methods for this task tend to be complex and underperform. Although omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) provide a promising end-to-end framework, they frequently fail in practice by degenerating into simple optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To overcome this, we propose Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a novel post-training method designed to control the model's reasoning process. Drawing on the Chain-of-Thought reasoning paradigm, VAPO enforces a structured \"Look before Transcription\" procedure using a format. Specifically, the model first performs OCR on the slide content within the think step, then generates the transcription by referencing this recognized visual information in the answer step. This reasoning process is optimized via reinforcement learning with four distinct rewards targeting format compliance, OCR accuracy, ASR quality, and visual anchoring consistency. To support further research, we construct SlideASR-Bench, a new entity-rich benchmark consisting of a synthetic dataset for training and testing, and a challenging real-world set for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAPO significantly improves recognition of domain-specific terms, establishing an effective end-to-end paradigm for SlideASR.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08618","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.788281","language":"en","tags":["research","cssd","preprints","eessas","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Rui Hu, Delai Qiu, Yining Wang, Shengping Liu, Jitao Sang","raw_content_length":1648,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OCR","Visually-Anchored Policy Optimization","ASR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1646,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Transcription","arXiv251008618v1 Announce Type","cross","Automatic speech recognition ASR systems","domain-specific terminology","specialized settings","academic lectures","the SlideASR task","which","the rich visual information"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["domain-specific terminology"],"research_academic":["academic lectures"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Transcription":2.0,"arXiv251008618v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Automatic speech recognition ASR systems":1.0,"domain-specific terminology":1.0,"specialized settings":1.0,"academic lectures":1.0,"the SlideASR task":1.0,"which":1.0,"the rich visual information":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7687556930555557,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1845,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6369,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9443,"joy":0.0024,"surprise":0.0244,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0086,"anger":0.0064,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (VAPO) to improve ASR accuracy using visual information from slides.

This motivates the development of a rigorous and readily applicable framework for studying properties of large multiplex networks. In this article, we provide a self-contained introduction to the limit theory of dense multiplex networks, analogous to the theory of graphons (limit theory of dense graphs). As applications, we derive limiting analogues of commonly used multiplex features, such as degree distributions and clustering coefficients. We also present a range of illustrative examples, including correlated versions of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi and inhomogeneous random graph models and dynamic networks.

By utilizing a data lookup strategy based on the SWAP architecture for the sparsity oracle $O_C$, and a direct sampling method for the amplitude oracle $O_A$ with SELECT-SWAP architecture, we achieve a T count that scales as $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{L})$ with respect to the number of interaction terms $L$ in general second-quantized Hamiltonians.

Even more powerful has been their interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs for a wide range of problems. This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading~(DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters.

Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165 neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence, and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection, global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146 WHO-classified \"uncertain\" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant prioritisation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08703","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.791131","language":"en","tags":["q-biope","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Linfeng Wang, Susana Campino, Taane G.

To enhance its practical relevance, we assume that the porous medium is anisotropic with permeability varying in all directions, making it a positive semidefinite matrix in the momentum equation. We assume the Navier-Stokes equations govern the flow in the free flow region, while the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy's equation governs the flow inside the porous medium. The coupled system contains a nonlinear term from the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation. We propose an approximate solution using an iterative method valid for a wide range of porous media parameter values. For both high and low values of the Darcy number, the asymptotic solutions derived from the regular perturbation method and matched asymptotic expansion show good agreement with the numerical results. However, these methods are not effective in the intermediate range. To address this, we employ the artificial Levenberg-Marquardt method with a back-propagated neural network (ALMM-BNN) paradigm to predict the solution in the intermediate range. While it may not provide the exact solutions, it successfully captures the overall trend and demonstrates good qualitative agreement with the numerical results. This highlights the potential of the ALMM-BNN paradigm as a robust predictive tool in challenging parameter ranges where numerical solutions are either difficult to obtain or computationally expensive. The current model provides valuable insights into the shear stress distribution of arterial blood flow, taking into account the variable viscosity of the blood in the presence of inertial effects. It also offers a framework for creating glycocalyx scaffolding and other microfluidic systems that can mimic the biological glycocalyx.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08745","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.791580","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","mathna","research","preprints","physicsflu-dyn","csna","math-ph","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":272,"author":"Timir Karmakar, Amrita Mandal","raw_content_length":1901,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.36,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Couette arXiv:2510.08745v1 Announce Type: cross"],"persons":["Darcy"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1900,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["neural networks application","Couette","Announce Type","Abstract","This study","Couette-Poiseuille flow","variable viscosity","a channel","a porous medium","its practical relevance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["neural networks application"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"neural networks application":2.0,"Couette":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"Couette-Poiseuille flow":1.0,"variable viscosity":1.0,"a channel":1.0,"a porous medium":1.0,"its practical relevance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.768877940277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.36,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.872,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8661,"joy":0.0224,"surprise":0.048,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.0081,"anger":0.0183,"disgust":0.0307},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (ALMM-BNN) for modeling fluid dynamics in porous media, potentially applicable to microfluidic systems.

Because text properties are often interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However, because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself, inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements, offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms, policy makers, and social scientists.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08758","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.791980","language":"en","tags":["statme","research","preprints","statap","cscl","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Graham Tierney, Srikar Katta, Christopher Bail, Sunshine Hillygus, Alexander Volfovsky","raw_content_length":1382,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1381,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Design","arXiv251008758v1 Announce Type","cross","Many social science questions","how linguistic properties","an audiences attitudes","behaviors","text properties","angry reviews","profane language"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Many social science questions"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Design":2.0,"arXiv251008758v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Many social science questions":1.0,"how linguistic properties":1.0,"an audiences attitudes":1.0,"behaviors":1.0,"text properties":1.0,"angry reviews":1.0,"profane language":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7688934994444443,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.487,"joy":0.0039,"surprise":0.0067,"sadness":0.01,"fear":0.045,"anger":0.4021,"disgust":0.0453},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new experimental design to isolate causal effects in social science, specifically evaluating the persuasiveness of humility in political communication.

As part of this work-in-progress study, we are working to create an atmospheric absorption spectrum prediction model for exoplanets. The eventual model will be based on both collected observational spectra and synthetic spectral data generated by the ROCKE-3D general circulation model (GCM) developed by the climate modeling program at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). In this initial study, spline curves are used to describe the bin heights of simulated atmospheric absorption spectra as a function of one of the values of the planetary parameters. Bayesian Adaptive Exploration is then employed to identify areas of the planetary parameter space for which more data are needed to improve the model. The resulting system will be used as a forward model so that planetary parameters can be inferred given a planet's atmospheric absorption spectrum.

The proposed approach divides the problem into a finite horizon OCP with a regularized terminal cost, guiding the system towards a terminal set, and an infinite horizon linear regulation phase within this set. This strategy guarantees global asymptotic stability under specific assumptions. Our method maintains the system's fully nonlinear dynamics until it reaches the terminal set, where the system dynamics is linearized. As the terminal set converges to the origin, the difference in optimal cost incurred reduces to zero, guaranteeing an efficient and stable solution. The approach is tested through simulations on three problems: spacecraft attitude control, rendezvous maneuver, and soft landing. In spacecraft attitude control, we focus on achieving precise orientation and stabilization. For rendezvous maneuvers, we address the navigation of a chaser to meet a target spacecraft. For the soft landing problem, we ensure a controlled descent and touchdown on a planetary surface. We provide numerical results confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method in managing these nonlinear dynamics problems, offering robust solutions essential for successful space missions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08854","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.793307","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","eesssy","cssy","computer-science","mathoc","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Abhijeet, Mohamed Naveed Gul Mohamed, Aayushman Sharma, Suman Chakravorty","raw_content_length":1370,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Optimal Control","OCP","Lyapunov Stability Guarantees for Space Applications"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1369,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimal Control","Lyapunov Stability Guarantees","Space Applications","arXiv251008854v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This paper","the infinite horizon optimal control problem","OCP","space applications"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimal Control":2.0,"Lyapunov Stability Guarantees":2.0,"Space Applications":2.0,"arXiv251008854v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"the infinite horizon optimal control problem":1.0,"OCP":1.0,"space applications":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7689410402777774,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.8895,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1779,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9029,"joy":0.0449,"surprise":0.0318,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0071,"disgust":0.0025},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a control method for space applications that could potentially reduce fuel consumption and improve mission efficiency.

Its significance lies in converting inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08916","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.794119","language":"en","tags":["statml","research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":208,"author":"Hideaki Kim, Tomoharu Iwata","raw_content_length":1582,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.04,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RKHS","Hawkes","Penalized Least Squares Minimization arXiv:2510.08916v1 Announce Type: cross"],"persons":["Hilbert"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1581,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Representer Theorem","Hawkes Processes","Penalized Least Squares Minimization","arXiv251008916v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","The representer theorem","a cornerstone","kernel methods","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Representer Theorem":2.0,"Hawkes Processes":2.0,"Penalized Least Squares Minimization":2.0,"arXiv251008916v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The representer theorem":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0,"kernel methods":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.768971650833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.9884999999999997,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2023,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6878,"joy":0.0806,"surprise":0.053,"sadness":0.0159,"fear":0.0182,"anger":0.1102,"disgust":0.0344},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel mathematical method for estimating interaction structures in event sequences.

The PoC device incorporates an integrated miniature optoelectronic sensing module and a microfluidic test cartridge. Methods Patients' serum total bilirubin concentrations, ranging from 2 {\\mu}mol/L to 480 {\\mu}mol/L, were measured using the PoC device and the standard laboratory method (n=20). Bland-Altman analysis and regression analysis using Passing-Bablok method were used to benchmark the PoC device against the standard laboratory measurements.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1a4a639f38e3","title":"Progressive Uncertainty","content":"arXiv:2510.08949v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Trustworthy medical image segmentation aims at deliver accurate and reliable results for clinical decision-making. Most existing methods adopt the evidence deep learning (EDL) paradigm due to its computational efficiency and theoretical robustness. However, the EDL-based methods often neglect leveraging uncertainty maps rich in attention cues to refine ambiguous boundary segmentation. To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty guided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature representation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA progressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank learning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for challenging regions. Concurrently, standard EDL methods suppress evidence of incorrect class indiscriminately via Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization, impairing the uncertainty assessment in ambiguous areas and consequently distorts the corresponding attention guidance. We thus introduce a semantic-preserving evidence learning (SAEL) strategy, integrating a semantic-smooth evidence generator and a fidelity-enhancing regularization term to retain critical semantics. Finally, by embedding PEUA and SAEL with the state-of-the-art U-KAN, we proposes Evidential U-KAN, a novel solution for trustworthy medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability over the competing methods.
