{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d3c566440a19","title":"Security of Key","content":"arXiv:2412.05026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We study the quantum security of key-alternating ciphers (KAC), a natural multi-round generalization of the Even--Mansour construction. KAC abstracts the round structure of practical block ciphers as public permutations interleaved with key XORs. The $1$-round KAC or EM setting already highlights the power of quantum superposition access: EM is secure against classical and Q1 adversaries (quantum access to the public permutation), but insecure in the Q2 model. The security of multi-round KACs remain largely unexplored; in particular, whether the quantum-classical separation extends beyond a single round had remained open. 1) Quantum Lower Bounds. We prove security of the $t$-round KAC against a non-adaptive adversary in both the Q1 and Q2 models. In the Q1 model, any distinguiser requires $\\Omega(2^{\\frac{tn}{2t+1}})$ oracle queries to distinguish the cipher from a random permutation, whereas classically any distinguisher needs $\\Omega(2^{\\frac{tn}{t+1}})$ queries. As a corollary, we obtain a Q2 lower bound of $\\Omega (2^{\\frac{(t-1)n}{2t}})$ quantum queries. Thus, for $t \\geq 2$, the exponential Q1-Q2 gap collapses in the non-adaptive setting, partially resolving an open problem posed by Kuwakado and Morii (2012). Our proofs develop a controlled-reprogramming framework within a quantum hybrid argument, sidestepping the lack of quantum recording techniques for permutation-based ciphers; we expect this framework to be useful for analyzing other post-quantum symmetric primitives. 2) Quantum Key-Recovery Attack. We give the first non-trivial quantum key-recovery algorithm for $t$-round KAC in the Q1 model. It makes $O(2^{\\alpha n})$ queries with $\\alpha = \\frac{t(t+1)}{(t+1)^2 + 1}$, improving on the best known classical bound of $O(2^{\\alpha' n})$ with $\\alpha' = \\frac{t}{t+1}$. The algorithm adapts quantum walk techniques to the KAC structure.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05026","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.968138","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","preprints","quant-ph","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":268,"author":"Chen Bai, Mehdi Esmaili, Atul Mantri","raw_content_length":1937,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["KAC"],"persons":["Mansour"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$1$-round","\\Omega(2^{\\frac{tn}{2t+1}})$"]},"char_count":1932,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Security","Key","KAC","replace-cross Abstract","the quantum security","key-alternating ciphers","a natural multi-round generalization","the Even--Mansour construction","the round structure","practical block ciphers"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Security":2.0,"Key":2.0,"KAC":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"the quantum security":1.0,"key-alternating ciphers":1.0,"a natural multi-round generalization":1.0,"the Even--Mansour construction":1.0,"the round structure":1.0,"practical block ciphers":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7751478741666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9163,"joy":0.0224,"surprise":0.0284,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0111,"anger":0.0117,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on the quantum security of key-alternating ciphers.

The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to explicitly evaluate this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. In this paper, we describe the hierarchical autoregressive network (HAN) algorithm in three spatial dimensions and study its performance using the example of the Ising model. We compare HAN with three other autoregressive architectures and the classical Wolff cluster algorithm. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamic observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as entropy and free energy, in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08610","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.969700","language":"en","tags":["hep-lat","research","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Piotr Bia{\\l}as, Vaibhav Chahar, Piotr Korcyl, Tomasz Stebel, Mateusz Winiarski, Dawid Zapolski","raw_content_length":1215,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ising","HAN","ANN","Autoregressive Neural Networks"],"persons":["Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1214,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks","arXiv250308610v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Autoregressive Neural Networks","ANN","a mechanism","the efficiency","several spin systems","The idea","the fact"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks","Autoregressive Neural Networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks":2.0,"arXiv250308610v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Autoregressive Neural Networks":1.0,"ANN":1.0,"a mechanism":1.0,"the efficiency":1.0,"several spin systems":1.0,"The idea":1.0,"the fact":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775206595,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.2985,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6597,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8886,"joy":0.029,"surprise":0.0571,"sadness":0.0045,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0111,"disgust":0.0051},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper describes a new algorithm (HAN) for simulating spin systems, specifically the Ising model.

Despite notable progress in current brain decoding models, a critical gap still persists in their systematic integration with established neuroscientific theories and the exploration of underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we present a novel framework that directly decodes fMRI signals into textual descriptions of viewed natural images. Our novel deep learning model, trained without visual information, achieves state-of-the-art semantic decoding performance, generating meaningful captions that capture the core semantic content of complex scenes. Neuroanatomical analysis reveals the critical role of higher-level visual cortices, including MT+ complex, ventral stream visual cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, in visual semantic processing. Furthermore, category-specific analysis demonstrates nuanced neural representations for semantic dimensions like animacy and motion. This work provides a more direct and interpretable framework to the brain's semantic decoding, offering a powerful new methodology for probing the neural basis of complex semantic processing, refining the understanding of the distributed semantic network, and potentially developing brain-sinpired language models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22697","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.970099","language":"en","tags":["research","csai","q-bionc","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Feihan Feng, Jingxin Nie","raw_content_length":1437,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1436,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Brain2Text Decoding Model","the Neural Mechanisms","Visual Semantic Processing","arXiv250322697v2 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","sensory experiences","neural activity","human-perceived visual stimuli","semantic content","a challenge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Brain2Text Decoding Model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Brain2Text Decoding Model":2.0,"the Neural Mechanisms":2.0,"Visual Semantic Processing":2.0,"arXiv250322697v2 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"sensory experiences":1.0,"neural activity":1.0,"human-perceived visual stimuli":1.0,"semantic content":1.0,"a challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775221315,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":5.85,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.17,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8753,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0484,"sadness":0.0159,"fear":0.0273,"anger":0.0145,"disgust":0.0116},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a novel deep learning model for decoding fMRI signals into textual descriptions of images.

A new set of constraints exploits a quasi-periodic structure of RMBPs to guarantee passive safety. Particularly, the condition for passive safety is expressed as simple geometric constraints by solving optimal control in Local Toroidal Coordinates, which is based on a local eigenspace of a quasi-periodic motion around the corresponding periodic orbit. The proposed formulation enables a significant simplification of problem structure, which is applicable to large-scale swarm reconfiguration in cislunar orbits. The method is demonstrated in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem, the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem, and the Bi-Circular Restricted Four-Body Problem. Furthermore, the optimized control profiles are validated in the full-ephemeris dynamics model.

Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features, respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency, a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator for Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled to the Noah land surface model (LSM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature (T2). Using random forest regression (RFR) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained on WRF output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in 2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers - most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in training. With RFR-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce uncertainties and test the method on other cities, the proposed approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI mitigation assessment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04802","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.972088","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","physicsao-ph","cslg","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"David Tschan, Zhi Wang, Dominik Strebel, Jan Carmeliet, Yongling Zhao","raw_content_length":1822,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.27,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["XGB","Weather Research","LSM","RFR","TSK"],"persons":["Noah","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1821,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Interpretable Machine Learning","Urban Heat Mitigation","Attribution","Weighting","Multi","UHIs","arXiv250704802v3","replace-cross Abstract","Urban heat islands","heat waves"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Interpretable Machine Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Interpretable Machine Learning":2.0,"Urban Heat Mitigation":2.0,"Attribution":2.0,"Weighting":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"UHIs":2.0,"arXiv250704802v3":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Urban heat islands":1.0,"heat waves":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7752972775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5855,"joy":0.0084,"surprise":0.0234,"sadness":0.0208,"fear":0.3164,"anger":0.034,"disgust":0.0114},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a machine learning approach to predict urban heat island effects, using data from Zurich heatwaves in 2017 and 2019 to train the model.

In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11970","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.973265","language":"en","tags":["cscr","research","preprints","quant-ph","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Mi-Ying Huang, Er-Cheng Tang","raw_content_length":1263,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bartusek"],"persons":["Vaikuntanathan","Brakerski"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1260,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Obfuscation","Unitary Quantum Programs","replace-cross Abstract","Program obfuscation","the inner workings","a program","its functionality","the quantum setting","recent works","obfuscation schemes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Obfuscation":2.0,"Unitary Quantum Programs":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Program obfuscation":1.0,"the inner workings":1.0,"a program":1.0,"its functionality":1.0,"the quantum setting":1.0,"recent works":1.0,"obfuscation schemes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7753521658333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9125,"joy":0.0055,"surprise":0.0104,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0047,"anger":0.0192,"disgust":0.041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical advancement in quantum program obfuscation.

This study presents an automated method to detect and quantify intestinal metaplasia using deep convolutional neural networks as well as a comparative analysis with visual estimations of three pathologists. Gastric samples were collected from two different cohorts: 149 asymptomatic volunteers from a region with a high prevalence of GCa in Colombia and 56 patients from a tertiary hospital. Deep learning models were trained to classify intestinal metaplasia, and predictions were used to estimate a percentage of intestinal metaplasia and to assign an adapted OLGIM stage. Atrophy was not assessed because of the limited reproducibility among pathologists. Results were compared with independent blinded metaplastic assessments performed by three graduated pathologists. The best-performing deep learning architecture classified intestinal metaplasia with F1-Score of 0.80 +- 0.01 and AUC of 0.91 +- 0.01. Among pathologists, inter-observer agreement by a Fleiss's Kappa score ranged from 0.20 to 0.48. In comparison, agreement between the pathologists and the best-performing model ranged from 0.12 to 0.35. Deep learning models show potential to reliably detect and quantify the percentage of intestinal metaplasia, achieving high classification performance. In practice, visual estimation is still the only available method, yet it is marked by considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning models provide consistent estimates that could help reduce this subjectivity in risk stratification.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06991","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.974860","language":"en","tags":["q-bioto","research","csce","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Fabian Cano, Mauricio Caviedes, Andres Siabatto, Jesus Villarreal, Jose Quijano, \\'Alvaro Bedoya-Urresta, Marino Coral Bedoya, Yomaira Yepez Caicedo, Angel Cruz-Roa, Fabio A.

We investigate these questions using a stated preference experiment with a nationally representative UK sample (n = 300), in which participants evaluated life satisfaction outcomes for both themselves and others under conditions of uncertainty. Individual-level utility functions were estimated using an Expected Utility Maximisation (EUM) framework and tested for sensitivity to the overweighting of small probabilities, as characterised by Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). A majority of participants displayed concave (risk-averse) utility curves and showed stronger aversion to inequality in societal life satisfaction outcomes than to personal risk. These preferences were unrelated to political alignment, suggesting a shared normative stance on fairness in well-being that cuts across ideological boundaries. The results challenge use of average life satisfaction as a policy metric, and support the development of nonlinear utility-based alternatives that more accurately reflect collective human values.

The structural properties of these networks, such as hub-dominated, heavy-tailed topology, network motifs, and node centrality, significantly influence diffusion speed and reach. Using epidemic diffusion models, specifically the Kertesz threshold model and the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, we analyze key factors affecting diffusion dynamics. To assess the uncertainty in the fraction of infected nodes over time, we employ bootstrap confidence intervals, while Bayesian credible intervals are constructed to quantify parameter uncertainties in the SI models. Our findings reveal substantial variations across different network types, including Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi networks, Geometric Random Graphs, and Delaunay Triangulation networks, emphasizing the role of network architecture in failure propagation. We identify that network motifs are crucial in diffusion. We highlight that hub-dominated networks, which dominate blockchain ecosystems, provide resilience against random failures but remain vulnerable to targeted attacks, posing significant risks to network stability. Furthermore, centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient strongly influence the transmissibility of diffusion in both blockchain and critical infrastructure networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23450","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:04.976445","language":"en","tags":["statme","research","physicssoc-ph","preprints","cssi","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"S M Mustaquim, Asim K.

Some of these are quite specific and intended for calculations in special systems (absence of free charges, etc.). All of these specific gauges are reductions of the Lorenz gauge. However, in addition to this gauge, two more, i.e., the Coulomb and velocity gauges, can be used to describe systems of charges and currents without any restrictions. It is commonly accepted opinion that these three gauges are equivalent, meaning that the expressions for electromagnetic fields obtained from the potentials defined in these gauges are identical. However, it can be shown that the Coulomb and velocity gauges yield solutions corresponding to `superluminal propagation' of the electric field. Since such a propagation of the electric field has not been observed experimentally and, moreover, is forbidden by special relativity, it can be concluded that calculations in these gauges may yield incorrect results. Therefore, these gauges cannot be used in applied electromagnetic calculations.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08583","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.960518","language":"en","tags":["physicsgen-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":167,"author":"Vladimir Onoochin","raw_content_length":1155,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.835,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Lorenz","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1152,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["What gauges","applied electromagnetic calculations","arXiv251008583v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the classical electrodynamics","different gauges","ie connections","the electromagnetic potentials","Some","these"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"What gauges":2.0,"applied electromagnetic calculations":2.0,"arXiv251008583v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the classical electrodynamics":1.0,"different gauges":1.0,"ie connections":1.0,"the electromagnetic potentials":1.0,"Some":1.0,"these":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7756153644444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8364,"joy":0.0128,"surprise":0.1305,"sadness":0.0065,"fear":0.0027,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0031},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes the validity of different gauges in electromagnetic calculations, finding that some gauges may lead to incorrect results.

We examine clutch-time performance in Japan's B.League using play-by-play and box-score data from the 2023-24 season. Defining clutch time as the final five minutes with a score margin within five points, we compare efficiency and shot selection between clutch and non-clutch windows. We focus on effective field-goal percentage (eFG%) by spatial category, including In the Paint, Mid-Range, and 3-Point, and investigate league-wide and team-level trends. We further profile player archetypes in clutch minutes via K-means clustering on filtered box-score features. Results show that paint touches and clean three-point looks remain comparatively efficient under pressure, whereas mid-range outcomes are more context-dependent. Championship games exhibit tighter defense and scouting, moderating three-point accuracy for many teams. Our findings highlight the need for tactical flexibility, balancing efficient shot selection with adaptive counters to defensive pressure. We discuss strategic implications for late-game play-calling, spacing, and lineup choices, and outline limitations and future directions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08597","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.961832","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","physicssoc-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Shota Shiiku, Jun Ichikawa","raw_content_length":1335,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Professional B.League arXiv:2510.08597v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":["Japan"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1334,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Trends","Performance","Visualization","Clutch Time","Japans Professional BLeague","clutch-time performance","new Abstract","the recent rise","Japanese basketballs competitiveness","pivotal outcomes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Trends":2.0,"Performance":2.0,"Visualization":2.0,"Clutch Time":2.0,"Japans Professional BLeague":2.0,"clutch-time performance":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the recent rise":1.0,"Japanese basketballs competitiveness":1.0,"pivotal outcomes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7756603799999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.867,"joy":0.0215,"surprise":0.0746,"sadness":0.0052,"fear":0.0102,"anger":0.0156,"disgust":0.0059},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":1,"innovation_quality":3,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article analyzes basketball performance data.

This study investigates whether these daily mobility patterns can quantitatively map the city's underlying social stratification. To overcome the persistent challenge of acquiring fine-grained socio-economic data, we constructed a multi-layered analytical dataset. We annotated 2,000 raw bike trips with local economic attributes, derived from a novel data enrichment methodology that employs a Large Language Model (LLM), and integrated contextual features of the built environment. A Random Forest model was then utilized as an interpretable framework to determine the key factors governing the relationship between mobility behavior and local economic status. The analysis reveals a compelling and unambiguous finding: a neighborhood's economic level, proxied by housing prices, is the single most dominant predictor of its bike-sharing patterns, substantially outweighing other geographic or temporal factors. This economic determinism manifests in three distinct ways: (1) a spatial clustering of resources, a phenomenon we term the \\textit{club effect}, which concentrates mobility infrastructure and usage in affluent areas; (2) a functional dichotomy between necessity-driven, utilitarian usage in lower-income zones and flexible, recreational usage in wealthier ones; and (3) a nuanced inverted U-shaped adoption curve that identifies the urban middle class as the system's primary user base.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08598","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.962267","language":"en","tags":["research","physicssoc-ph","physics","preprints","statap","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Yingche Liu, Mengyang Li","raw_content_length":1605,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.085,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Random Forest"],"persons":["Socio arXiv:2510.08598v1 Announce Type"],"locations":["Shanghai"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1604,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mapping Socio","arXiv251008598v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The massive digital footprints","bike-sharing systems","megacities","Shanghai","a novel perspective","the urban socio-economic fabric","This study"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Shanghai"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mapping Socio":2.0,"arXiv251008598v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The massive digital footprints":1.0,"bike-sharing systems":1.0,"megacities":1.0,"Shanghai":1.0,"a novel perspective":1.0,"the urban socio-economic fabric":1.0,"This study":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7756756491666668,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.1245,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6249,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8846,"joy":0.0262,"surprise":0.0622,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0125,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The study analyzes existing bike-sharing data to understand socio-economic patterns, but it doesn't directly reduce GHG emissions.

The flow inside the wavy channel with a porous substrate is governed by the Darcy-Brinkman equation. We used the perturbation approach to ascertain the solution to the problem, assuming that the ratio between the channel width and the wavelength is very small (i.e., $\\delta^2 \\ll 1$). We solved the problem up to $O(\\delta^2)$ by assuming $\\lambda^2 \\delta^2 \\ll 1$, where $\\lambda$ is the ratio of anisotropic permeability. Our primary objective is to investigate how the anisotropic permeability ratio influences flow reversal near the crest and trough of a wavy wall under both steady flow conditions and when a pulsatile component is superimposed on the steady flow. In the case of steady flow, flow separation occurs near the crest region of the wavy wall, leading to the formation of recirculating zones where fluid becomes trapped. In contrast, for pulsatile flow as well as combined effects of steady and pulsatile flow, vortices form transiently at certain phases of the pulsation cycle. Subsequently, these vortices bulge into the mainstream, resulting in a complete backflow. We explored the approximate flow reversal zone using Darcy's approximation theory far from the wavy wall. The flow recirculation associated with steady flow is critical for mass transport and enhances convective mixing. On the other hand, flow reversal at different time instances can optimize oxygen transfer in devices such as membrane oxygenators.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08729","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.964348","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","physics","preprints","physicsflu-dyn","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Sanchita Pramanik, Timir Karmakar","raw_content_length":1642,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Darcy-Brinkman"],"persons":["\\lambda$"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\lambda^2"]},"char_count":1641,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["steady and pulsatile flow","an anisotropic porous medium","An investigation","the combined effect","a wavy channel","new Abstract","an analytical solution","the impact","a symmetric wavy channel","The flow"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"steady and pulsatile flow":3.0,"an anisotropic porous medium":3.0,"An investigation":2.0,"the combined effect":2.0,"a wavy channel":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"an analytical solution":1.0,"the impact":1.0,"a symmetric wavy channel":1.0,"The flow":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7757520725,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7167,"joy":0.0371,"surprise":0.0662,"sadness":0.0153,"fear":0.0336,"anger":0.0468,"disgust":0.0843},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents an analytical solution for fluid flow in a wavy channel with a porous medium, relevant to applications like membrane oxygenators.

This work develops an analytic formulation to describe the transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of a discrete, strongly driven instability in the presence of energy sources and sinks. Initially, the mode is found to evolve linearly until the gradient in the distribution has been exhausted. It then transitions to a nonlinear phase governed by a Bernoulli differential equation, for which a closed-form analytic solution is found, and continues to evolve until the energy sources and sinks reach equilibrium. During the nonlinear phase, the leading order distribution function is found to persistently satisfy an advection-diffusion equation in time and energy coordinates. These analytical results are shown to agree closely with nonlinear kinetic simulations and to be readily applicable in the study of resonant transport in plasmas, galaxies and viscous shear flows.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08735","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.964752","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","astro-phga","preprints","physicsflu-dyn","physicsplasm-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Emma G.

However, non-invasive probing of light-induced surface potential dynamics at these interfaces remains challenging due to limited surface sensitivity. Here, we introduce a nanophotonic approach that amplifies second harmonic generation (SHG) from nanostructured solid-liquid interfaces by over two orders of magnitude, providing real-time, all-optical access to light-driven interfacial phenomena. Using in-situ SHG at silicon-oxide-electrolyte interfaces, we uncover two concurrent pathways for light-mediated modulation: (i) low-intensity illumination induces photocharging via carrier generation and trapping, while (ii) high-intensity excitation leads to photothermal heating that modifies surface group dissociation through temperature-dependent reaction equilibria. We further show that nanostructured semiconductor interfaces deviate markedly from the monotonic electrolyte-concentration dependence predicted by Gouy-Chapman theory. Instead, the surface potential exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic behavior governed by interfacial geometry, consistent with prior device-level observations. Importantly, SHG measurements reveal that this concentration-dependent modulation of surface potential directly alters the electronic polarizability of silicon, exposing the underlying ion-electronic coupling at the solid-liquid boundary. By combining nanophotonic design, in-situ SHG probing, and quantitative modeling, this work establishes an experimentally validated framework for actively manipulating interfacial charge distributions to advance the performance of solid-liquid energy conversion technologies.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08809","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.965629","language":"en","tags":["physicschem-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Tarique Anwar, Diana DallAglio, Milad Sabzehparvar, Giulia Tagliabue","raw_content_length":1873,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.075,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Revealing Light-Driven Dynamics","SHG"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1872,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Light-Driven Dynamics","Nanostructured Solid","arXiv251008809v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Light","heat","key drivers","interfacial chemistry","solid-liquid boundaries","fundamental processes"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Light-Driven Dynamics":2.0,"Nanostructured Solid":2.0,"arXiv251008809v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Light":1.0,"heat":1.0,"key drivers":1.0,"interfacial chemistry":1.0,"solid-liquid boundaries":1.0,"fundamental processes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7757979616666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.404,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6808,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8067,"joy":0.0175,"surprise":0.0439,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.064,"anger":0.0339,"disgust":0.0257},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel nanophotonic approach to study light-driven interfacial phenomena relevant to sustainable energy conversion.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_2f7960231126","title":"Experimental observation of energy","content":"arXiv:2510.08819v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a non-Hermitian system.

However, conventional gamma spectroscopy using high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors is difficult due to high activity levels in discharge pebbles, leading to excessive dead time and Compton scattering. This study explores the use of bent crystal diffraction (BCD) spectrometers to filter the emitted gamma spectrum and isolate key peaks for improved measurement accuracy and speed. Pebble wise depletion calculations were performed and the resulting spectra were analyzed using ray tracing (SHADOW3) and gamma response modeling (GADRAS). Key isotopes, $^{137m}$Ba/$^{137}$Cs, $^{239}$Pu, $^{144}$Ce, $^{148m}$Pm, and $^{140}$La, were found to strongly correlate with burnup, residence time, core passes, plutonium production, and fluence. Machine learning regression models applied to simulated spectra achieved a coefficient of determination ($R^2$) as high as 0.995 for burnup prediction. Among various BCD configurations, mosaic silicon crystals in the (440) orientation combined with an HPGe detector provided optimal performance for $^{137m}$Ba, while (220) and (440) configurations paired with scintillators were effective for the remaining isotopes.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08835","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.966447","language":"en","tags":["nucl-ex","research","physics","preprints","physicsins-det","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Ian Kolaja, Lee Bernstein, Ludovic Jantzen, Eleanor Tubman, Tatiana Siaraferas, Massimiliano Fratoni","raw_content_length":1353,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Pebble Bed Reactors arXiv:2510.08835v1 Announce Type:","BCD","SHADOW3"],"persons":["Burnup Measurement","burnup","Burnup","Compton","^{148m}$Pm"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1352,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Burnup Measurement","Bent Crystal Spectrometer","Pebble Bed Reactors","arXiv251008835v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Burnup measurement","pebble bed reactors","PBRs","fuel pebbles","the core"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Burnup Measurement":2.0,"Bent Crystal Spectrometer":2.0,"Pebble Bed Reactors":2.0,"arXiv251008835v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Burnup measurement":1.0,"pebble bed reactors":1.0,"PBRs":1.0,"fuel pebbles":1.0,"the core":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7758298458333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.1085,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7783,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8631,"joy":0.0082,"surprise":0.0568,"sadness":0.012,"fear":0.0123,"anger":0.0249,"disgust":0.0227},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into a new method for measuring burnup in pebble bed reactors.

Here, we introduce a sequence of temporal Jackiw-Rebbi kinks that act as a programmable flip of the Dirac mass, exchanging the amplifying and decaying in-gap modes. By launching two seeded pulses with a controlled relative phase, we demonstrate topological pair annihilation in spacetime domain, the phase-selective cancellation of counter-propagating, k-gap-amplified modes. The resulting spatiotemporal cascade appears superluminal, yet causality is preserved because the cascaded pattern carries no net energy flux. To facilitate implementation, we construct a minimal time-varying non-Hermitian lattice model and reproduce the phase-selective pair annihilation behavior, establishing a direct continuum-lattice correspondence.

For cavity ringdown spectroscopy, a cavity consisting of two supermirrors provides a long path length, where high reflectance of the supermirrors results from their slight excess loss. In the case of a crystal coating supermirror, the excess loss has been suggested to depend on polarization. On the other hand, an amorphous coating supermirror was expected to have a negligible polarization dependence. In this work, we measured the excess loss as a function of mirror rotation around its optical axis in the optical region at 681.2 nm for the three amorphous coating supermirrors produced simultaneously by vapor deposition in the same furnace. The back mirror of the cavity was rotated, and the ringdown time as a function of rotational angle was measured every 10 degrees. As a result, sinusoidal variations in excess loss were observed depending on the rotation. The difference in excess loss between the best and worst rotational angles during the rotation of the back mirror reached a maximum of 5.8 +- 1.2 ppm. This difference demonstrates the importance of optimizing the rotational angle alignment of supermirrors to achieve high sensitivity via a long path length in cavity ringdown spectroscopy.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09053","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.968192","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Mitsunori Araki, Kohsuke Suma","raw_content_length":1332,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.035,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1331,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Polarization Dependence","Excess Loss","Amorphous Coating Supermirror","Optical Region","Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy","arXiv251009053v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A long optical path length","sensitive spectroscopy","cavity ringdown spectroscopy"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Polarization Dependence":2.0,"Excess Loss":2.0,"Amorphous Coating Supermirror":2.0,"Optical Region":2.0,"Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy":2.0,"arXiv251009053v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A long optical path length":1.0,"sensitive spectroscopy":1.0,"cavity ringdown spectroscopy":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7758978841666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":1.012,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7976,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8171,"joy":0.0106,"surprise":0.0847,"sadness":0.0177,"fear":0.0145,"anger":0.0224,"disgust":0.033},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on improving the sensitivity of cavity ringdown spectroscopy by optimizing the alignment of supermirrors.

Our experimental results reveal that bubble entrainment occurs only within a specific region close to the point where the jet exits the water and is dictated solely by the jet's exit velocity, rather than the Reynolds number. The morphology of the jet above the pool surface, influenced predominantly by the Froude number or the injection angle, classifies the flow into two regimes: curtain jet and column jet. However, variations in jet morphology have minimal impact on the critical velocity required for bubble entrainment. Our findings suggest that bubble entrainment is driven by the dynamic interplay of shear forces and instabilities. As the jet exits the nozzle, it interacts with the surrounding fluids, amplifying instabilities through Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanisms. These disturbances generate intense fluctuations on the jet surface, creating localized low-pressure zones that trap air and entrain bubbles. As the jet progresses further into the air, capillary forces dampen surface instabilities, diminishing the jet's capacity to sustain bubble entrainment at longer distances. This study offers new insights into the mechanics of air entrainment in turbulent water jets, emphasizing the role of injection velocity and instabilities in the entrainment process.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09067","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.968625","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","physicsflu-dyn","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Fangye Lin, Mingbo Li","raw_content_length":1433,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Reynolds"],"persons":["Kelvin-Helmholtz"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1432,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bubble entrainment","turbulent jets","liquid surface","the jet","new Abstract","the phenomenon","air","turbulent water jets","a pool","the free surface"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Bubble entrainment"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bubble entrainment":2.0,"turbulent jets":2.0,"liquid surface":2.0,"the jet":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the phenomenon":1.0,"air":1.0,"turbulent water jets":1.0,"a pool":1.0,"the free surface":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7759132777777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7446,"joy":0.01,"surprise":0.0436,"sadness":0.0091,"fear":0.1128,"anger":0.0392,"disgust":0.0407},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents experimental results on bubble entrainment in turbulent water jets.

In particular, the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase has enabled optical metasurfaces with broad applications. However, the PB phase is based on polarization evolution in a two-dimensional space, which fails to account for other polarization degrees of freedom. Here, we generalize the concept of geometric phase to a four-dimensional (4D) Riemann-Silberstein (RS) space that characterizes the complete electromagnetic polarization, including electric, magnetic, and hybrid polarizations. We show that the 4D polarization evolution in the RS space can give rise to a new geometric phase-the RS phase-in addition to the PB phase. The PB phase depends on optical spin and usually manifests in circularly polarized light, whereas the RS phase depends on optical linear momentum and can manifest in arbitrarily polarized light. Their synergy provides a unified geometric framework for light propagation at interfaces and enables unprecedented high-dimensional light control. As a proof of principle, we propose and demonstrate RS metasurfaces capable of multiplexed wavefront shaping, which can reconfigure up to twelve distinct outputs via switching incident 4D polarization. Our work uncovers a new class of optical geometric phases, with promising applications in high-capacity optical communication, parallel information processing, and multifunctional nanophotonic design.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09112","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.970557","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Yuqiong Cheng, Yuan-Song Zeng, Wanyue Xiao, Tong Fu, Jiajun Wu, Geng-Bo Wu, Din Ping Tsai, Shubo Wang","raw_content_length":1488,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Riemann arXiv:2510.09112v1 Announce Type: new Abstract","the Pancharatnam-Berry ("],"persons":["Riemann-Silberstein"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1487,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Riemann","new Abstract","Geometric phases","a powerful mechanism","light manipulation","optical metasurfaces","broad applications","the PB phase","polarization evolution","a two-dimensional space"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Riemann":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Geometric phases":1.0,"a powerful mechanism":1.0,"light manipulation":1.0,"optical metasurfaces":1.0,"broad applications":1.0,"the PB phase":1.0,"polarization evolution":1.0,"a two-dimensional space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775986440833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8745,"joy":0.0169,"surprise":0.0658,"sadness":0.0078,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0172,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach to light manipulation using a generalized geometric phase.

The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_560435eaffee","title":"Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces","content":"arXiv:2510.09117v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09117","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.971427","language":"en","tags":["research","cond-matmes-hall","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":256,"author":"Izzatjon Allayarov, Vittorio Aita, Diane J.

To reduce the computational cost associated with finite-element (FE) simulations of insulated HTS coils, the simultaneous multi-scale homogeneous (SMSH) method can be considered. It combines a macroscopic-scale homogenized magnet model with multiple single-tape models and solves both scales monolithically. In this work, the SMSH method is reformulated using the $h$-$\\phi$ thin-shell (TS) approximation, where analyzed tapes are collapsed into thin surfaces, simplifying mesh generation. Moreover, the magnetic field is expressed as the gradient of the magnetic scalar potential outside the analyzed tapes. The discretized field is then described with nodal functions, further reducing the size of the FE problem compared to standard $h$ formulations. The proposed $h$-$\\phi$ SMSH-TS method is verified against state-of-the-art homogenization methods on a 2-D benchmark problem of stacks of HTS tapes. The results show good agreement in terms of AC losses, turn voltage and local current density, with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to reference models.

Continuous operation and upgrades are underway to achieve even higher luminosities. Maintaining a high instantaneous luminosity requires sustaining high beam currents in the storage rings, which in turn demands efficient beam injection from the injector.

However, in literature there seems to be no consensus on the optimal eye alignment for such experiments. Typically, experiments are performed by presenting stimuli nasally or temporally, but the angle under which the few-photon pulses are presented varies between 7 deg and 23 deg. Here we combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements from literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment conditions and necessary alignment precision. We find that stimuli, directed at the eye's nodal point, may be best presented under an inferior angle of 13.1 deg with respect to the visual axis. Defining a target area on the retina with a radius of 0.5 mm around the optimum location, we find the horizontal and vertical angular precision should be better than 0.85 deg given a horizontal and vertical translational precision of 1 mm and a depth translational precision of 5 mm.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09186","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.973050","language":"en","tags":["q-bioqm","research","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"T.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_c7b0f355eef4","title":"Crab","content":"arXiv:2510.09198v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) is a new-generation $e^+e^-$ collider proposed in China, designed to operate in the center-of-mass (CoM) energy range of 2-7 GeV. To achieve the design luminosity exceeding 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 at the optimal CoM energy of 4 GeV, a large crossing angle combined with the crab-waist correction scheme is adopted. However, this scheme introduces strong nonlinearities in the interaction region (IR) due to the extremely low vertical beta function of beta_y* <=1 mm, which significantly limits dynamic and momentum apertures of the collider ring. This paper presents a comprehensive modular optics design that addresses these challenges through several key features: 1) local chromaticity correction up to third order to enhance momentum bandwidth; 2) exact -I transformation between chromatic sextupole pairs for nonlinear cancellation; 3) minimization of the dispersion invariant along the IR to improve local momentum acceptance; 4) optimized beta functions at crab sextupole locations to reduce strength requirements and associated nonlinearities. Resonance driving terms analysis confirms effective suppression of geometric aberrations while preserving the intended crab-waist effects. When integrated into the collider ring, the design achieves a Touschek lifetime exceeding 300 s at beam energy of 2 GeV, meeting STCF requirements. The impact of fringe fields from superconducting quadrupoles is mitigated using octupole correctors, and detector solenoid effects are fully suppressed via local anti-solenoid compensation. Furthermore, the defined machine-detector interface layout ensures minimal synchrotron radiation background at the IP beryllium chamber, while ultra-high vacuum conditions are required to suppress beam-gas background. This IR design represents the current optimal solution for STCF and has been incorporated into the project's conceptual design report.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09198","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.973536","language":"en","tags":["physicsacc-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":270,"author":"Linhao Zhang, Tao Liu, Ye Zou, Penghui Yang, Demin Zhou, Jiancong Bao, Ze Yu, Yuhan Jin, Yihao Mo, Sangya Li, Tianlong He, Qing Luo, Jingyu Tang","raw_content_length":1960,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.35,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["STCF","The Super Tau-Charm Facility","Crab arXiv:2510.09198v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":["China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1959,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Crab","arXiv251009198v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The Super Tau-Charm Facility","STCF","a new-generation ee- collider","China","mass","2-7 GeV","the design luminosity"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Crab":2.0,"arXiv251009198v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The Super Tau-Charm Facility":1.0,"STCF":1.0,"a new-generation ee- collider":1.0,"China":1.0,"mass":1.0,"2-7 GeV":1.0,"the design luminosity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776098693888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.4435,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8887,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8728,"joy":0.0189,"surprise":0.0747,"sadness":0.0085,"fear":0.0051,"anger":0.0144,"disgust":0.0055},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on the design of a collider, specifically the interaction region, aiming to improve its performance.

Yet, ambiguity surrounding their definition and constituent elements presents challenges in understanding and evaluating neighbourhood profiles, highlighting the need for a more detailed and systematic assessment. This research develops a composite Liveability Index for Greater London based on metrics related to the proximity, density, and diversity of POIs, along with population density, and investigates how neighbourhood liveability relates to active travel behaviour. The Index is based on the principles of the 15-minute city paradigm (Moreno et al. 2021) and developed in line with OECD guidelines for composite indicators (European Union and Joint Research Centre 2008). The Index revealed distinct spatial patterns of neighbourhood liveability, with high liveability neighbourhoods predominantly clustered in Inner London. Decomposing the Index provided further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each neighbourhood. Footfall modelling using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) indicates a generally positive relationship between liveability and footfall, with spatial variation in the strength of this association. This research offers a new perspective on conceptualising and measuring liveability, demonstrating its role as an urban attractor that fosters social interaction and active engagement.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09296","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.975407","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","physicssoc-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Philyoung Jeong, Ivann Schlosser, Alexei Poliakov, Elsa Arcaute","raw_content_length":1537,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OECD","Joint Research Centre","Liveability","European Union"],"persons":["Moreno"],"locations":["London"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1536,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Announce Type","new Abstract","Healthy and liveable neighbourhoods","essential components","sustainable urban development","ambiguity","their definition","constituent elements","challenges","understanding"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["sustainable urban development"],"engineering":["sustainable urban development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Healthy and liveable neighbourhoods":1.0,"essential components":1.0,"sustainable urban development":1.0,"ambiguity":1.0,"their definition":1.0,"constituent elements":1.0,"challenges":1.0,"understanding":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7761601180555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.352500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6705,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8583,"joy":0.0318,"surprise":0.0378,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0377,"anger":0.0217,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":4,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research develops a liveability index and relates it to active travel.

In this review, we summarize techniques for the trapping and cooling of atomic and molecular ions in radiofrequency traps including Doppler and resolved-sideband laser cooling, sympathetic cooling, and cryogenic buffer-gas methods. We discuss strategies for controlling key reaction parameters: the preparation of specific internal quantum states by internal cooling, optical pumping, state-selective photoionization and quantum-logic spectroscopy; the manipulation of collision energies through micromotion control, dynamic trapping and combination with molecular beams; and the selection of molecular structure via isotopic substitution, conformational separation and isomer-specific ion generation. We illustrate applications of these approaches by discussing studies on quantum-state-dependent kinetics, quantum-resonance effects and structure-sensitive reactivity in ion-neutral collisions. We conclude by outlining future challenges, including full state-to-state reaction mapping, reaching the ultracold quantum regime free of micromotion, and the exploration of complex and chiral systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09298","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.975808","language":"en","tags":["physicschem-ph","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":165,"author":"Prerna Paliwal, Jutta Toscano, Stefan Willitsch","raw_content_length":1327,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.825,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Doppler"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1326,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["chemical reactions","radiofrequency ion traps","Control","arXiv251009298v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","the past years","an attractive platform","a high degree","control","ion-molecule dynamics"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Control","control"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"chemical reactions":3.0,"radiofrequency ion traps":3.0,"Control":2.0,"arXiv251009298v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the past years":1.0,"an attractive platform":1.0,"a high degree":1.0,"control":1.0,"ion-molecule dynamics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776175175833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.036999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8074,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8788,"joy":0.0457,"surprise":0.0321,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0089,"anger":0.0186,"disgust":0.0101},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is a review of techniques for controlling chemical reactions in radiofrequency ion traps.

We demonstrate its versatility across various cavity systems, including dielectric planar resonators, GaAs-based polariton microcavities, and CdTe platforms supporting nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons. The microlenses not only enhance collection efficiency but also enable tightly focused excitation, yielding an order of magnitude reduction in condensation thresholds compared with conventional setups.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_406a5d9468c3","title":"Interactions between syn","content":"arXiv:2510.09366v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Intermediate rifted margins exhibit neither seaward dipping reflectors nor exhumed mantle at the continent-ocean transition (COT). Instead, they transition into normal-thickness, magmatic Penrose-type oceanic crust, and thus diverge from the classic magma-rich and magma-poor end-member models. However, several intermediate margins, such as the South China Sea (SCS), display detachment faulting similar to magma-poor margins and magmatic underplating typical of magma-rich ones. How tectonics and magmatism interact in these intermediate environments is poorly understood. Here we use 2D numerical models to demonstrate that the elevated initial geotherm inherited from prior plate subduction in the SCS explains several key observations: an early phase of wide rifting, subsequent localization onto core complexes with substantial footwall magmatic intrusions, and eventual formation of normal igneous oceanic crust at break-up. Thermal weakening caused by syn-rift footwall magmatic intrusions facilitates lower crustal ductile flow, promoting the development of rolling-hinge type detachment faults and exhumation of core complexes. These structures are associated with accelerated tectonic subsidence, which is later moderated by detachment-related doming, as observed in the SCS. Normal-thickness oceanic crust occurs after break-up, even under ultra-slow extension rates used in our simulations, highlighting the importance of inheritance in determining margin architecture, the spatio-temporal distribution of syn-rift magmatism, and the nature of the COT. This behavior contrasts sharply with magma-poor margins, where a cooler lithosphere and similar ultra-slow extension produce no syn-rift magmatism, leading instead to crustal embrittlement, mantle serpentinization and exhumation at the COT.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09366","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.976651","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","physicsgeo-ph","astro-phep","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Peng Yang, Marta Perez-Gussinye, Shaowen Liu, Javier Garcia-Pintado, Gudipati RaghuRam","raw_content_length":1855,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.21,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SCS"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["the South China Sea"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1854,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Interactions","syn","arXiv251009366v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Intermediate","margins","dipping reflectors","exhumed mantle","the continent-ocean transition","COT"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Interactions":2.0,"syn":2.0,"arXiv251009366v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Intermediate":1.0,"margins":1.0,"dipping reflectors":1.0,"exhumed mantle":1.0,"the continent-ocean transition":1.0,"COT":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7762070361111113,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.3,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.34,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5974,"joy":0.013,"surprise":0.117,"sadness":0.0477,"fear":0.0534,"anger":0.0316,"disgust":0.14},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a numerical model explaining the formation of intermediate rifted margins.

Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09413","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.978264","language":"en","tags":["physicschem-ph","cond-matmtrl-sci","research","physics","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Alejandro Castro, Nuria H.

Here, we show that such textures also arise in the polarization eigenstates of light propagation through flat dielectric devices with an engineered, space-dependent optic-axis orientation. We focus on two-dimensional periodic structures, where propagation through multiple devices maps onto quantum dynamics on a synthetic optical lattice. Adopting the condensed-matter framework, a spatial period defines an effective Brillouin zone, and polarization eigenstates can be grouped in two bands, with the role of energy played by the opposite phase delay. When such eigenstates exhibit skyrmionic textures, the corresponding lattice model shows the topology of a Chern insulator. These structures result from the interaction between the optical field and the medium and do not reflect a topological structure of the medium itself. We validate these concepts in a system of three tunable liquid-crystal metasurfaces. Using quantum process tomography based on supervised machine learning, we reconstruct the polarization eigenmodes over one spatial period. We identify configurations of the devices' parameters that lead to topologically non-trivial bands, where we directly observe skyrmionic eigenpolarization textures. Along the analogy with condensed matter, we also extract local observables of lattice models, such as the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. We finally report a numerical simulation of an all-optical quantum Hall effect emerging when light propagates through a sequence of such devices, arranged so as to mimic the effect of an external force on the lattice.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09427","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.979526","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":244,"author":"Francesco Di Colandrea, Lorenzo Marrucci, Filippo Cardano","raw_content_length":1724,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.22,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Chern"],"persons":["Skyrmionic"],"locations":["Brillouin"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1723,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Skyrmionic polarization textures","structured dielectric planar media","arXiv251009427v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Skyrmionic patterns","optical fields","diverse photonic platforms","such textures","the polarization eigenstates","light propagation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Skyrmionic polarization textures":2.0,"structured dielectric planar media":2.0,"arXiv251009427v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Skyrmionic patterns":1.0,"optical fields":1.0,"diverse photonic platforms":1.0,"such textures":1.0,"the polarization eigenstates":1.0,"light propagation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776314053888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8666,"joy":0.0303,"surprise":0.0783,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0035,"anger":0.0126,"disgust":0.0052},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on skyrmionic polarization textures in dielectric planar media.

Inspired by the mechanics of the Gravitron and extended via the conceptual AntiGravitron, this study proposes a new class of inequality metrics grounded in multivariate mixtures of Beta distributions. These composite metrics capture three key structural dimensions of polarizing inequality: the number and balance of population clusters (modal entropy), the internal uniformity of each cluster (concentration), and the separation between clusters in attribute space (geometric divergence). Monte Carlo simulations of the AntiGravitron show how bifurcation, stratification, and polarization jointly influence inequality measurements due to multidimensional attraction-repulsion forces. An empirical application of the AntiGravitron to US household income data reveals polarized inequality driven by intersecting centripetal and centrifugal socio-economic forces affecting Black and African American populations in the Philadelphia County. By bridging physical systems theory and social stratification analysis, this paper offers a rigorous, flexible, and interpretable metric that enhances the understanding of polarizing inequality in high-dimensional, structurally heterogeneous contexts.

We report the experimental observation of plasmas with nanosecond-scale lifetimes, near-solid density, and keV-level temperatures, produced by irradiating periodic arrays of composite nanowires with ultra-high contrast, relativistically intense femtosecond laser pulses. Jet-like plasma structures extending up to 1~mm from the nanowire surface were observed, emitting K-shell radiation from He-like Ti$^{20+}$ ions. High-resolution X-ray spectra were analyzed using 3D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of the laser-plasma interaction combined with collisional--radiative modeling (FLYCHK). The results indicate that the jets consist of plasma with densities of $10^{20}$-$10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and keV-scale temperatures, persisting for several nanoseconds. We attribute the formation of these jets to the generation of kiloTesla-scale global magnetic fields during the laser interaction, as predicted by PIC simulations. These fields may drive long-timescale current instabilities that sustain magnetic fields of several hundred tesla, sufficient to confine hot, dense plasma over nanosecond durations.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09437","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.980371","language":"en","tags":["research","physicsoptics","physics","preprints","hep-ex","physicsplasm-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":169,"author":"Ehsan Eftekhari-Zadeh, Mikhail Gyrdymov, Parysatis Tavana, Robert Loetzsch, Ingo Uschmann, Thomas Siefke, Thomas K\\\"asebier, Uwe Zeitner, Adriana Szeghalmi, Alexander Pukhov, Dmitri Serebryakov, Evgeni Nerush, Igor Kostyukov, Olga Rosmej, Christian Spielmann, Daniil Kartashov","raw_content_length":1343,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.845,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Relativistic Laser arXiv:2510.09437v1 Announce Type","keV-sc","FLYCHK"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["10^{20}$-$10^{22}$"]},"char_count":1342,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma","Relativistic Laser","arXiv251009437v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Long-living hot and dense plasmas","ultra-intense laser beams","critical importance","laser-driven nuclear physics","bright hard X-ray sources","laboratory astrophysics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Long Living Hot and Dense Plasma":2.0,"Relativistic Laser":2.0,"arXiv251009437v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Long-living hot and dense plasmas":1.0,"ultra-intense laser beams":1.0,"critical importance":1.0,"laser-driven nuclear physics":1.0,"bright hard X-ray sources":1.0,"laboratory astrophysics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7763459444444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8302,"joy":0.044,"surprise":0.0647,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0079,"anger":0.0348,"disgust":0.0114},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reports experimental observation of long-lived, hot, and dense plasmas using lasers.

As a disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2500-m deep bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half-cubic hectometer 3D mooring-array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep-sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001degrC, variable convection-turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating, movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial-wave breakdown that commonly occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09470","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.980782","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","preprints","physicsao-ph","physicsflu-dyn","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Hans van Haren (Km3NeT Collaboation)","raw_content_length":1085,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.775,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["heatin","Announce Type"],"locations":["the Mediterranean Sea"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1084,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Whipped and mixed warm clouds","the deep sea","arXiv251009470v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Turbulence","nutrients","all life forms","land","the ocean","the development"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["the development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Whipped and mixed warm clouds":2.0,"the deep sea":2.0,"arXiv251009470v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Turbulence":1.0,"nutrients":1.0,"all life forms":1.0,"land":1.0,"the ocean":1.0,"the development":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776362226111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.1315,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2263,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7411,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.1099,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.0487,"anger":0.0453,"disgust":0.0321},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a deployed array of temperature sensors in the deep sea, providing unique 3D movies of water motions.

Nonlinearity, long regarded as a nuisance in precision systems, is increasingly recognized as a gateway to new physical regimes. While such dynamics have been extensively studied in optics and atomic physics, macroscopic systems are rarely associated with long-lived coherence and nonlinear control and remain an untapped platform for probing the fundamental nonlinear processes. Here, we report the observation of long-lived oscillatory dynamics in millimeter-scale levitated dielectric quartz particles exhibiting clear signatures of nonlinear mode coupling, a positive largest Lyapunov exponent of 0.0095 s^-1, and partial energy recurrences-phenomena strongly reminiscent of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou physics. We observe dissipation rates below 4*10E-6 Hz, limited by our ability to measure dissipation in presence of nonlinear dynamics. We estimate an intrinsic acceleration sensitivity of 62*10E-12 g/sqrt(Hz), at room temperature. The magnetic trap is constructed from a static arrangement of permanent magnets, requiring no external power or active feedback.

Melamine formaldehyde particles were employed to form a stable, hexagonally ordered bilayer crystal within a confinement ring electrically isolated from the grounded cathode. By systematically adjusting the confinement ring bias, a distinct phase coexistence emerged: it is characterized by a fluid-like melted core surrounded by a solid crystalline periphery. Crucially, analysis of the phonon spectra revealed frequency shifts that deviate significantly from the predictions of classical monolayer Mode-Coupling Instability (MCI) theory. Stability analysis further demonstrated that dynamic interlayer particle pairing and non-reciprocal interactions play a pivotal role in destabilizing the bilayer structure. These findings highlight previously underappreciated mechanisms driving the melting transition in bilayer dusty plasmas, offering a more comprehensive understanding of phase behavior in complex plasma systems. The results underscore the importance of interlayer coupling and confinement effects in tuning structural transitions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09491","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.981673","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physics","physicsplasm-ph","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":168,"author":"Siddhartha Mangamuri (Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Pune, India), Surabhi Jaiswal (Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Pune, India), L\\'ena\\\"ic Cou\\\"edel (Department of Physics and Engineering Physics, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada)","raw_content_length":1293,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.84,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Mode-Coupling Instability","MCI"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1292,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Solid","arXiv251009491v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This article","a detailed investigation","solid-fluid phase coexistence","a bilayer dusty plasma crystal","varying confinement ring bias voltages","a DC glow discharge argon plasma","Melamine formaldehyde particles"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a detailed investigation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Solid":2.0,"arXiv251009491v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This article":1.0,"a detailed investigation":1.0,"solid-fluid phase coexistence":1.0,"a bilayer dusty plasma crystal":1.0,"varying confinement ring bias voltages":1.0,"a DC glow discharge argon plasma":1.0,"Melamine formaldehyde particles":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776392140277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.614,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8175,"joy":0.0368,"surprise":0.0339,"sadness":0.0155,"fear":0.0252,"anger":0.0257,"disgust":0.0454},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the behavior of dusty plasma crystals.

The so-called emission cutoff can be extended towards higher photon energies by increasing the driving wavelength at the expense of conversion efficiency. An alternative route is to overdrive the process by using higher laser intensities, with the challenging requirement of interacting with higher plasma densities over short propagation distances. Here, we address this challenge by using a differentially pumped glass chip designed for optimal gas confinement over sub-mm lengths. By driving HHG with multicycle pulses at either 800 nm or 1500 nm, we demonstrate a cutoff extension by a factor of two compared to conventional phase matching approaches and surpassing the present record using multicycle fields. Our three-dimensional propagation simulations, in excellent agreement with the experiment, confirm that gas confinement is crucial since efficient phase matching of cutoff harmonics occurs only for short propagation lengths. Additionally, we show that the high photon energy component is not only temporally confined to the leading edge of the driving pulse, but also spatially confined in the near-field to an off-axis contribution due to reshaping of the driving field along propagation inside the medium. Our findings contribute to the fundamental understanding of HHG across different regimes.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09496","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:12.982102","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","physics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Agata Azzolin, Gaia Giovannetti, Oliviero Cannelli, Sabine Rockenstein, Guangyu Fan, Md S.
