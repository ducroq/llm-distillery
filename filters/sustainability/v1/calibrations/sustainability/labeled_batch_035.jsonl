The strongly degenerate case is analyzed. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions on the initial data that guarantee the stability and uniqueness of the solution obtained from a one-point measurement. Moreover, we present more general uniqueness theorems, which also cover the identification of the initial data, the coefficient of the zero order term and the degeneracy power, using measurements taken over time. Our method is based on a careful analysis of the spectral problem and relies on an explicit form of the solution in terms of Bessel functions. Our investigation also covers the case of real 1-D degenerate parabolic systems of equations coupled with a specific structure. Theoretical results are also supported by numerical simulations.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13962","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.613234","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathap","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":151,"author":"Piermarco Cannarsa, Veronica Danesi, Anna Doubova","raw_content_length":1019,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.755,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["Bessel"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1018,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reconstruction","degeneracy region","power","parabolic equations","systems","arXiv250913962v2","Announce Type","the inverse problem","a degeneracy point","the diffusion coefficient"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["power"],"engineering":["systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reconstruction":2.0,"degeneracy region":2.0,"power":2.0,"parabolic equations":2.0,"systems":2.0,"arXiv250913962v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"the inverse problem":1.0,"a degeneracy point":1.0,"the diffusion coefficient":1.0}},"age_hours":2.795893931666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.5135000000000005,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8653,"joy":0.0255,"surprise":0.0338,"sadness":0.0135,"fear":0.0137,"anger":0.0177,"disgust":0.0306},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical research on inverse problems for parabolic equations, specifically focusing on recovering degeneracy points in diffusion coefficients.

Teams of workers with different qualifications must be formed, and loading or unloading tasks must be assigned to them. Each task has a time window within which it can be started and should be finished. Violating these temporal restrictions incurs severe financial penalties for the operator. In practice, various components of this process are subject to uncertainties. We consider the aforementioned problem under the assumption of stochastic travel times across the apron. We present two binary program formulations to model the problem at hand and propose a novel solution approach that we call Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch, in which we dynamically switch between two master problem formulations. Furthermore, we use an exact separation method to identify violated rank-1 Chv\\'atal-Gomory cuts and utilize an efficient branching rule relying on task finish times. We test the algorithm on instances generated based on real-world data from a major European hub airport with a planning horizon of up to two hours, 30 flights per hour, and three available task execution modes to choose from. Our results indicate that our algorithm is able to significantly outperform existing solution approaches. Moreover, an explicit consideration of stochastic travel times allows for solutions that utilize the available workforce more efficiently, while simultaneously guaranteeing a stable service level for the baggage handling operator.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20912","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.627596","language":"en","tags":["econgn","mathoc","q-finec","mathematics","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":237,"author":"Andreas Hagn, Rainer Kolisch, Giacomo Dall'Olio, Stefan Weltge","raw_content_length":1642,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.185,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Branch-Price-Cut-and-Switch"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1641,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Branch-Price-Cut","arXiv240520912v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","airport operations","dedicated personnel","baggage handling tasks","a crucial role","the design","resource-efficient processes","Teams"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["airport operations"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Branch-Price-Cut":2.0,"arXiv240520912v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"airport operations":1.0,"dedicated personnel":1.0,"baggage handling tasks":1.0,"a crucial role":1.0,"the design":1.0,"resource-efficient processes":1.0,"Teams":1.0}},"age_hours":2.796389474722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.258000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2342,"joy":0.0043,"surprise":0.0052,"sadness":0.1057,"fear":0.0443,"anger":0.5689,"disgust":0.0375},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm for optimizing baggage handling at airports, which can lead to more efficient use of resources and a reduction in operational costs.

They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17953","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.628841","language":"en","tags":["math-ph","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":219,"author":"Lennart Bittel, Antonio Anna Mele, Jens Eisert, Lorenzo Leone","raw_content_length":1605,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.095,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["\\varepsilon$"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1604,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Optimal trace","the correlation matrix","arXiv240917953v3 Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Free-fermionic states","fermionic Gaussian states","an important class","quantum states","physics","their correlation matrix"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Optimal trace":2.0,"the correlation matrix":2.0,"arXiv240917953v3 Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Free-fermionic states":1.0,"fermionic Gaussian states":1.0,"an important class":1.0,"quantum states":1.0,"physics":1.0,"their correlation matrix":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7964328655555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.7655,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9165,"joy":0.0033,"surprise":0.0388,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0099,"anger":0.0137,"disgust":0.0111},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper focuses on improving the efficiency of quantum state tomography and property testing, specifically for free-fermionic states.

Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.632161","language":"en","tags":["gr-qc","math-ph","hep-th","mathematics","preprints","quant-ph","mathmp","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Ning Bao, Hao Geng, Yikun Jiang","raw_content_length":1571,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Ryu-Takayanagi Formula","OPE","CFT"],"persons":["Liouville"],"locations":[],"monetary":["\\textit{microscopic"]},"char_count":1570,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ryu-Takayanagi Formula","Multi","replace-cross Abstract","a class","quantum states","multiple entangled CFTs","AdS_3CFT_2","multi-boundary black hole geometries","entanglement entropy","only boundary CFT data"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ryu-Takayanagi Formula":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"a class":1.0,"quantum states":1.0,"multiple entangled CFTs":1.0,"AdS_3CFT_2":1.0,"multi-boundary black hole geometries":1.0,"entanglement entropy":1.0,"only boundary CFT data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7965059966666663,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8924,"joy":0.0202,"surprise":0.0588,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.004,"anger":0.015,"disgust":0.0057},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and its connection to entanglement entropy in CFTs.

In chemistry, the construction and identification of even rudimentary oscillators remain elusive and lack a general framework. Using parameter-rich kinetics - a methodology enabling the disentanglement of parametric dependencies from structural analysis - we investigate the stoichiometry of chemical oscillators. We introduce the concept of oscillatory cores: minimal subnetworks that guarantee the potential for oscillations in any reaction network containing them. These cores fall into two classes, depending on whether they involve positive or negative feedback. In particular, the latter class unveils a family of oscillators - yet to be synthesized - that require a minimum number of reaction steps to exhibit oscillations, a phenomenon we refer to as the principle of length. We identify several mechanisms through which catalysis promotes oscillations: (I) furnishing instability (e.g. autocatalysis), (II) lifting dependencies, (III) lowering length thresholds. Notwithstanding this mechanistic ubiquity, we show that oscillators can also be realized without employing any catalysis. Our results highlight branches of chemistry where oscillators are likely to arise by chance, suggest new strategies for their design, and point to novel classes of oscillators yet to be realized experimentally.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15273","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.634974","language":"en","tags":["q-biomn","mathematics","preprints","research","mathds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Alexander Blokhuis, Peter F.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_2d33f08e3e70","title":"WSB.APP/PS1 mice develop age","content":"Vascular contributions are now widely accepted to play a key role in many cases of dementia, including Alzheimers disease (AD), that commonly manifest as cerebral small vessel diseases, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the mechanisms by which vascular contributions such as CAA contribute dementias such as AD are not well understood. This is due in part to the lack mouse models that develop robust CAA, hampering our ability to develop therapies that target vascular deficits. To address this, we have explored the use of distinct genetic contexts to enhance the face validity of mouse models for AD. We have previously identified the WSB/EiJ (WSB) strain as a model that shows increased susceptibility to CAA in the presence of the APP/PS1 amyloid driver, compared to the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Here, we now perform an in-depth characterization of WSB.APP/PS1 and its WSB wild type (WT) counterpart, assessing male and female mice, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age (M). We show that WSB.APP/PS1 mice show mild CAA at 8M, with robust CAA being apparent at 14M. Transcriptional profiling showed strong correlation to AMP-AD gene expression modules highlighting the human relevance of WSB.APP/PS1 mice and predicted white matter deficits at 14M that was confirmed by immunofluorescence. PET/CT showed blood flow and metabolic deficits, and modifications in small vessel morphology in 8M WSB.APP/PS1 compared to WSB WT mice. We tested whether cerebrovascular reactivity deficits in WSB WT mice may underly the susceptibility to CAA, but interestingly, they did not show age-dependent decline in reactivity that was observed in B6 mice. Finally, using an allelic series of humanized apolipoprotein E (APOE), we show that APOE4 increased the extent of CAA in WSB.APP/PS1 mice, compared to APOE2 and APOE3, but in a sex-dependent manner. Collectively, these data show the utility of the WSB strain to uncover mechanisms of vascular contributions to Alzheimers disease and related dementias.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681261v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.169001","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":314,"author":"Onos, K.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_08cab06eb6f9","title":"Red-light","content":"Most optogenetic tools are controlled by blue light. Red-light responsive tools enable multiwavelength applications and allow greater biological tissue penetration with reduced toxicity. Current red-light tools are primarily based on phytochromes, large dimeric proteins with a structurally complex mode of interaction with their binding partners. Here we introduce a small red-light-only responsive system composed of a GA domain (6 kDa) that binds to a CBCR GAF domain (17 kDa) with a Kd ~1-5 M to form a 1:1 complex in the dark. Red light causes dissociation of the complex by causing a >25-fold decrease in binding affinity. The CBCR GAF domain reverts to the dark state with a half-life of ~1 min and the complex reforms. Structural analysis using NMR measurements combined with molecular docking and dynamics simulations shows that the binder interacts with the GAF domain and senses isomerization of the bilin chromophore at a site that overlaps the critical tongue domain of phytochromes. This system provides a small, simple red-light-only optogenetic tool that can operate to control protein-protein interactions in vitro and in living cells.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681461v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.170758","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":177,"author":"Le, G.

These transparent fibers, featuring a 175m inner diameter, 25m wall thickness, and an approximate molecular weight cutoff of 30kDa, possess both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. This amphiphilic nature helps maintain a potent lumen structure even in dry, open air, enabling precise handling and orientation of small specimens prior to resin polymerization and eliminating the need for remounting. The protocol includes specimen transfer using wire loops, microwave-assisted chemical pre-fixation, dissection on a soft silicone substrate with micro-scissors, and manipulation of hollow fibers using insect pins. This approach preserves the identity of individual specimens throughout processing. During ultramicrotomy, the fiber serves as a visual guide, enhancing alignment and reproducibility of sectioning. As proof of principle, we demonstrate well-preserved ultrastructural features in chemically fixed, microwave-assisted resin-embedded C. elegans specimens. This method offers a robust and reproducible alternative to conventional gelatinous media encapsulation, particularly suited for TEM analysis of scarce or small biological samples.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681240v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.171027","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Liou, W., Belnap, D.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_6fe5e61dcbf8","title":"Long Term Culture of Germ","content":"Host associated microbiota play essential roles in regulating digestion, nutrient acquisition, immunity, and xenobiotic metabolism. Disruption of these communities is linked to numerous diseases and health defects though causal mechanisms underpinning these associations remain unclear in most cases. Gnotobiotic zebrafish provide a scalable low-cost in vivo model that is increasingly used to resolve causality in host-microbiota interactions. However, reliance on live diets limits the use of gnotobiotic zebrafish to early life stages where body systems and microbial communities are incompletely developed. As a result, many important host-microbiota interactions may be unable to be studied in this model system. Here we tested a simple method for long-term husbandry of gnotobiotic zebrafish using gamma-irradiated chow diets and evaluated effects on growth, gene expression, and microbial community composition. In conventionally reared animals, gamma irradiated diets did not affect growth or survival and only modestly impacted microbial community composition and diversity. In contrast, gnotobiotic zebrafish maintained on sterile irradiated diets for 55 days post fertilization were smaller, weighed less, and exhibited aberrant genes expression profiles relative to controls. These genes were enriched for pathways, related to immune response, xenobiotic metabolism, organ development, liver function, and lipid metabolism, with many expression patterns linked to the abundance of specific microbial taxa. Together, these findings establish a practical protocol for long-term maintenance of gnotobiotic zebrafish and extend the utility of this model to study microbiome-dependent effects on host physiology, and development beyond early larval stages of life.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681431v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.171572","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Okyere, L., Di Fulvio, A., Gaulke, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c3606f052d8f","title":"Mechanistic insights into the activity of Benzoxaboroles against Cryptosporidium parvum: CPSF3 targeting and resistance implications","content":"Benzoxaboroles are emerging as promising treatments against a broad range of protozoan parasites, including Trypanosoma, Leishmania, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, and Cryptosporidium. We previously demonstrated that the benzoxaborole compound AN3661 inhibits the endonuclease activity of CPSF3 in Cryptosporidium hominis, likely by disrupting pre-mRNA processing, which in turn limits parasite growth. In this study, we further explored its mode of action and found that a specific mutation (Y385N) in CPSF3 of C. parvum confers strong resistance to AN3661. Interestingly, this mutation does not affect the parasites sensitivity to two other benzoxaboroles, AN13762 and AN7973, which are also thought to target CpCPSF3. All three compounds interfered with mRNA processing in C. parvum, consistent with inhibition of CPSF3 complex activity, and showed parasiticidal activity, especially during the late stages of merogony, blocking parasite egress. Two of them also impaired gamogony. In T. gondii, AN7973 remained effective against several strains carrying mutations within TgCPSF3 that confer resistance to AN3661 and AN13762, suggesting that it might represent an alternative chemotype targeting CPSF3 with the potential to overcome resistance. Notably, AN7973 successfully controlled severe infection in susceptible mice challenged with the AN3661-resistant C. parvum strain carrying the CpCPSF3Y385N mutation. Finally, we extended the known antiparasitic spectrum of AN3661 and AN7973 to include Eimeria tenella and Giardia duodenalis, two important pathogens in veterinary and human health. Altogether, our findings refine the understanding of CPSF3-targeting benzoxaboroles, identify alternative chemotypes with the potential to bypass resistance, and support their potential use in combination therapies to delay or prevent the emergence of drug resistance.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681364v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.172128","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Wenker, J., Braun, L., Swale, C., Gouin, A., Pichon, J., Sedano, L., Baty, T., Dobrescu, I., Lalle, M., Hakimi, M.-A., Bougdour, A., LAURENT, f.","raw_content_length":1858,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cryptosporidium","CPSF3","Trypanosoma","Plasmodium"],"persons":["Benzoxaboroles","CpCPSF3"],"locations":["Benzoxaboroles","Cryptosporidium","Toxoplasma"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1858,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Benzoxaboroles","CPSF3","Mechanistic insights","the activity","Cryptosporidium parvum","treatments","a broad range","protozoan parasites","Trypanosoma","Leishmania"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Benzoxaboroles":3.0,"CPSF3":3.0,"Mechanistic insights":2.0,"the activity":2.0,"Cryptosporidium parvum":2.0,"treatments":1.0,"a broad range":1.0,"protozoan parasites":1.0,"Trypanosoma":1.0,"Leishmania":1.0}},"age_hours":30.799043211666664,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8432,"joy":0.0093,"surprise":0.028,"sadness":0.0107,"fear":0.0215,"anger":0.0466,"disgust":0.0406},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on benzoxaboroles as potential treatments for parasitic infections.

Ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways determined by differentially expressed genes (DEG) and DSD approaches. ALD significantly decreased hepatic transcriptome -diversity correlating with increased relative contribution of select genes. These changes were driven by lower abundance gene expression loss. DEG and DSD analyses showed overlapping genes and canonical pathways, but DSD also identified novel genes and pathways not highlighted by DEG. Importantly, DSD more effectively identified differences between preclinical ALD and AH severity stages. ALD decreases hepatic transcriptome heterogeneity, favoring pathways associated with organ damage or damage response.

While its role in exteroception - the perception of the external environment - has been extensively studied, attentional processes in interoception, the perception of bodily states, are less well understood. In this study, we exploited high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging and concurrent field monitoring to investigate interoceptive attention at the level of cortical layers during a heartbeat attention task. Voxel-wise analyses reveal increased activity in the bilateral dorsal mid-insula during interoceptive attention (attending to one's heartbeat) compared to exteroceptive attention (attending to auditory white noise). Layer-specific analyses further demonstrate that this difference in activity is significantly higher in upper compared to lower cortical layers. This activation pattern persists after accounting for potential vascular artifacts through a deconvolution analysis with a physiological point spread function (PSF). To our knowledge, these findings represent the first empirical demonstration of layer-specific processes during interoceptive attention in human cortex.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_0e6051636501","title":"HypoAD: volumetric and single","content":"Alterations in metabolism, stress response, sleep, circadian rhythms, and neuroendocrine processes are key features of aging and neurodegeneration. These fundamental processes are regulated by the hypothalamus, yet how its functionally distinct subregions and cell types change during human aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains largely unexplored. Here, we present HypoAD, a comprehensive atlas of the human hypothalamus in aging and AD, integrating high-resolution MRI from 202 individuals with single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of 614,403 nuclei from young, AD, and age-matched non-dementia controls. Our analysis reveals that hypothalamic subregions governing metabolism, stress, and circadian rhythms are particularly vulnerable, exhibiting significant changes in both volumes and gene expression during aging and AD. At the molecular level, machine learning models identified the inflammatory response and regulators of circadian rhythms as key cellular predictors of AD. These signatures were reflected in specific cell types: microglia transitioned to a pro-inflammatory state, while inhibitory neurons within sleep- and circadian-regulating hypothalamic subregions showed the most profound transcriptional alterations, including disruptions in ligand-receptor interactions and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Together, HypoAD provides a high-resolution volumetric map and a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of the human hypothalamus in aging and AD, linking lifestyle and behavioral changes to their underlying volumetric and molecular pathways. Additionally, HypoAD provides a framework to investigate hypothalamic dysfunction and establishes a roadmap for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating physiological disruptions to potentially slow disease progression.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681270v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.172977","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":227,"author":"Yu, D., Germann, J., Murtaza, G., Hajdarovic, K.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_7c10133f4896","title":"Rapid inversion of singleton distractor representations underlies learned attentional suppression","content":"In visually complex and dynamically changing environments, humans often face the challenge of filtering out salient stimuli that are presently irrelevant to their tasks. Recent evidence suggests that through repeated exposure to search arrays containing salient color singleton distractors, individuals can learn to divert their attention away from such salient but irrelevant stimuli, even before they capture attention. However, the mechanisms underlying such attentional suppression remain unclear. The current study examined trajectories of singleton distractor representations during visual searches to address this gap. Using multivariate pattern analyses on EEG data (N = 40), we found that singleton distractor representations underwent a rapid inversion approximately 200 ms into the search. These inverted representations were coded in a shared subspace with target representations, but in a reversed orientation, presumably to downweight their salience in the spatial priority map. Target locations were consistently enhanced compared to non-singleton distractors, while singleton distractors were suppressed. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of rapid representational transformation underlying salient distractor suppression at the onset of visual search. The rapid inversion of pop-out singleton distractor signals resulted in an inverted arrangement of target and distractor representations in a shared neural subspace, which facilitates subsequent read-out of both target enhancement and distractor suppression signals in the computation of spatial priorities to successfully guide search.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.680699v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.173258","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":215,"author":"Zhang, Z., Lewis-Peacock, J.

However, the etiology of pulmonary vascular endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction, an established precursor to PVD, is incompletely understood but may involve abnormal blood flow patterns, hypoxemia, and polycythemia. Hypothesis: Utilizing an ovine Glenn model, we hypothesized that non-pulsatile pulmonary blood flow (PBF) induces pulmonary vascular EC dysfunction, independent of hypoxemia or polycythemia. Methods: Seven lambs (6-8 weeks old) underwent a Glenn procedure. Eight weeks later, Glenn and age-matched controls were studied. The response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (Ach) was determined in isolated pulmonary arteries (PA). Nitric oxide (NO) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) signaling was determined in right lung tissues. Indices of cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis were determined in PA endothelial cells (PAECs). Comparisons were made by unpaired t-test and ANOVA. Results: There were no differences in age, hemoglobin, or oxygen saturation between groups. Mean PA pressure and left PA flow were higher, and right lung blood flow was lower in Glenn lambs compared to controls (p<0.05). All other baseline hemodynamics were similar. Glenn PAs had impaired relaxation to Ach. Glenn lung NO metabolite levels (NOx) and eNOS protein were lower, and ET-1 levels and prepro-ET-1 protein were higher than controls (p<0.05). Glenn PAECs had higher rates of proliferation and angiogenesis, and decreased apoptosis (p < 0.05).

Both the secretion of lipid (in the platelet releasate) and intra-platelet lipid signaling have been shown to be important modulators to platelet activity and thrombosis. However, the relationship between platelet and releasate lipid profiles and how they respond to key agonists remain less clear. With a purposely designed human platelet targeted lipidomics platform which detected more than 550 platelet and releasate lipid species encompassing >30 lipid classes/subclasses, I presented in this study major changes to platelet lipidome triggered by acute and prolonged thrombin and collagen stimulations. I have demonstrated that overall lipid release from platelets was suppressed by collagen at the acute phase, a phenomenon that to my knowledge has yet to be reported. Additionally, prolonged thrombin treatment did not cause further production of lipid mediators. It nevertheless triggered an overall release of lipid into the surrounding (as releasate), including several proinflammatory and apoptotic lipids e.g., DG, ceramide, S1P, PA. Correlation tests between platelet/releasate lipid profiles and platelet surface markers P-selectin and PAC1 suggested that several di-/polyunsaturated phospholipid species and CoQ negatively correlated with collagen-stimulated PAC1 expression and PI 40:4(b) positively correlated with collagen-stimulated P-selectin expression. Finally, our study identified one lipid class, LPC-O, and one lipid species, PE 38:7, as potential predictors for the reactivity of platelet, with platelet LPC-O level positively correlated with collagen-stimulated increment of surface PAC1 expression and PE 38:7 correlated negatively with the increase in surface P-selectin in response to thrombin treatment.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681267v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.173872","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":251,"author":"Peng, K.-Y.","raw_content_length":1845,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.255,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1845,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["lipidomics","novel platelet activating mechanisms","The activation","platelets","consequent thrombi formation","hallmark events","cardiovascular diseases","Both the secretion","lipid","the platelet releasate"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["hallmark events"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"lipidomics":2.0,"novel platelet activating mechanisms":2.0,"The activation":1.0,"platelets":1.0,"consequent thrombi formation":1.0,"hallmark events":1.0,"cardiovascular diseases":1.0,"Both the secretion":1.0,"lipid":1.0,"the platelet releasate":1.0}},"age_hours":30.79913144111111,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.302499999999998,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6605,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8394,"joy":0.0049,"surprise":0.0254,"sadness":0.0338,"fear":0.046,"anger":0.0151,"disgust":0.0355},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies specific lipid species correlated with platelet reactivity.

They are studied as models to understand host-specific disease and they have a wide variety of applications in biotechnology, including vaccines, oncolytic virotherapy, and immunotherapy. Despite a nearly fourfold variation in genome sizes across the Poxviridae family, the basic genome architectural features driving their evolution remain poorly understood. In this study of the summated poxvirus genome sequence database, we report that while only a weak negative correlation exist between viral coding densities and genome sizes, we detected a strong positive correlation between the number of assigned open reading frames (ORF) and genome sizes. We observe an inflection point at a genome size of 229kb, above or below with the percentage of genes encoding secreted proteins increasing with genome size, and the percentage of predicted cytoplasmic proteins decreasing with genome size. Additionally, we observed a weak positive correlation between the potential of transcript overlap that would be expected to generate dsRNA and genome size. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant positive correlation between coding density and GC-content in mpox virus isolates (R2 = 0.799). Further analysis illustrated a rise in both GC-content and coding density of mpox isolates between 2022 and 2024. Codon usage bias was observed to be clustered by virus families, with tryptophan being the least utilized amino acid across all poxviruses. Protein distribution analysis revealed a right-skewed distribution of poxviral predicted ORFs, with the 150 - 250 amino acid cohort containing the highest number of viral proteins. Finally, we observe a significant positive correlation between ITR sizes and duplicate gene clusters (R2 =0.679).

{"id":"science_biorxiv_e89e38004dfc","title":"Exploring Genome","content":"Background: Bacterial cellulose (BC), natively synthesized by Komagataeibacter spp., is a biodegradable biomaterial with superior mechanical properties. However, under agitated cultivation, cellulose producing strain (Cel +) often transition to non-producing mutants (Cel -), restricting scalability and hindering widespread use. Agitation-associated shear stress, elevated oxygen levels, and genetic mutations have been linked to the emergence of the Cel- phenotype. A genome-wide investigation that considers population heterogeneity and dynamics is essential to reveal the mutational landscape and evolutionary processes driving this phenotypic shift. Results: Over successive rounds of agitated cultivation, the strain transitioned to a planktonic state, losing BC production. Whole-genome sequencing revealed both structural variations (SVs) and non-structural variations (NSVs). Contrary to previous reports, SVs, including insertion sequences (IS) mediated junction events, did not affect genes related to BC synthesis. Instead, the accumulation and positive selection of NSVs, such as frameshift and replication slippage events, in key BC-related genes, strongly correlated with the loss of cellulose synthesis. Conclusions: This study provides the first genome-wide population-level analysis revealing mutational dynamics underlying the BC phenotypic switch in Komagataeibacter spp. under agitated conditions. We show that BC-related gene mutations are not solely driven by SVs, with NSVs emerging as equally critical contributors. Furthermore, the genomic evidence implicates broader involvement of quorum sensing and cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate signaling, suggesting both genetic and regulatory factors underlying the disruption of BC synthesis. These findings highlight the importance of examining genetic heterogeneity with population to understand phenotypic adaptation for strain improvement strategies for scalable BC production.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681338v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.174975","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Bersanetti, D., Mangayil, R.","raw_content_length":1956,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SVs","Komagataeibacter spp."],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1956,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Genome","Cel","Background","Bacterial cellulose","Komagataeibacter spp","a biodegradable biomaterial","superior mechanical properties","agitated cultivation","producing strain","often transition"],"filter_categories":{"hydrogen_energy":["Cel"],"ai_ml":["producing strain"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Genome":2.0,"Cel":2.0,"Background":1.0,"Bacterial cellulose":1.0,"Komagataeibacter spp":1.0,"a biodegradable biomaterial":1.0,"superior mechanical properties":1.0,"agitated cultivation":1.0,"producing strain":1.0,"often transition":1.0}},"age_hours":30.799192628333333,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7158,"joy":0.0085,"surprise":0.0269,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.0734,"anger":0.0954,"disgust":0.0717},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies genetic factors affecting bacterial cellulose (BC) production, a biodegradable material.

Phenotypic assays validated these predictions: L. capsici BCSIR-Raj-01 solubilized phosphate, produced IAA and siderophores, grew on hydrocarbons, and exhibited diazotrophic activity. Notably, the strain showed potent larvicidal activity against Culex and Anopheles larvae, suggesting ecological roles beyond plant association. Together, these results establish L. capsici BCSIR-Raj-01 as a multifunctional bacterium with potential applications in crop improvement, bioremediation, and biological vector control.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681324v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.175236","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Patwary, R.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_19678df6556e","title":"Persistent LPS insertion, spatial segregation and vesicle biogenesis drive growth","content":"The barrier and load-bearing functions of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane (OM) depend on ordered, dense packing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major constituent of its outer leaflet. Despite its importance, LPS spatiotemporal dynamics and turnover mechanisms remain poorly understood. Existing models posit that LPS turnover only occurs via passive dilution during growth-dependent OM expansion, restricting adaptive LPS turnover, especially in nutrient-limited conditions. Here, using innovative pulse chase LPS metabolic labelling techniques in combination with super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli maintains OM homeostasis through continuous removal of pre-existing LPS and insertion of new LPS, even during stationary phase. We show that newly inserted LPS localises at discrete sites across the OM, remaining spatially segregated from pre-existing, background LPS. These observations challenge established OM organisational principles, suggesting an insertion-trapping mechanism can maintain LPS-rich clusters independent of a thermodynamically-driven phase separation. Time-lapse super-resolution imaging, biochemical assays, and nanoparticle tracking collectively reveal that OM vesicle (OMV) release mediates background LPS clearance. Our findings reveal bacteria have the capacity to remodel their surface architecture through OMV-mediated LPS turnover in a growth-independent manner. These insights redefine OM homeostasis and establish OMV biogenesis as fundamental to OM adaptation in Gram-negative bacteria.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.09.681453v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.175777","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Nabarro, J., Baumann, C.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c79d99db487d","title":"Hippocampo","content":"Hippocampal communication with subcortical circuits reorganizes across sleep-wake states, yet the dynamics of such interactions remain incompletely defined. We simultaneously recorded neuronal spiking and local field potentials from the dorsal hippocampus (CA1 and dentate gyrus) and limbic subcortical nuclei (supramammillary nucleus (SuM) and lateral septum (LS)) in freely behaving rats across the sleep-wake cycle. During quiescent states (non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep and quiet wakefulness), sharp-wave ripples dominated hippocampal activity and produced fast, top-down excitation, with large population surges locally in CA1 and DG, and more modest but significant activation in LS and SuM, whereas dentate spikes elicited smaller state-invariant responses. Conversely, in the bottom-up direction, epochs of high-discharge SuM activity were associated with slower, state-dependent activation of hippocampal populations that was larger in wake than in sleep, revealing distinct temporal scales and state dependence for reciprocal pathways. During activated, theta-enriched states (rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and active wakefulness), spike-field coupling revealed circuit-wide theta coordination. In active wakefulness, SuM bursts produced brief inhibition of CA1 spiking while theta oscillations organized a multiregional firing sequence around the theta cycle trough; yet SuM neurons were not significantly phase-locked. In REM sleep, this pattern inverted, with only SuM neurons significantly phase-locking to theta waves, and preferred firing near the theta cycle peak. Together, these findings identify state-dependent, bidirectional coordination between hippocampus and subcortical nuclei, characterized by ripple-locked top-down hippocampal output during quiescent states and SuM-mediated bottom-up modulation that reconfigures under theta during activated states.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681248v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.176708","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":242,"author":"Caneo, M.

Comparing laboratory-reared and wild-caught individuals is essential for understanding how environmental history shapes neural and sensory traits and for assessing the ecological validity of laboratory findings. Despite this, relatively few studies have taken this approach. We used auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to compare ABR thresholds and ABR wave characteristics between laboratory-reared and wild-caught prairie voles. ABR recordings show that, similar to other semi-fossorial rodents, M. ochrogaster exhibit a hearing range of 1 - 46 kHz with peak sensitivity around 8 to 32 kHz. However, wild-caught prairie voles displayed significantly lower ABR thresholds at 1, 4, 8, 16, and 24 kHz compared to laboratory-reared prairie voles. There were significant differences in interpeak latency between both tested groups, with laboratory-reared prairie voles showing faster interpeak latency responses than wild-caught voles. However, there were no differences in amplitude ratios between groups. Laboratory-reared prairie voles showed faster normalized latencies and higher relative amplitude of the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the ABR than wild-caught voles. There were no significant differences in ABR thresholds, interpeak latency, amplitude ratio, normalized latency, and relative amplitude between the sexes. These differences in auditory processing support the importance of integrating both wild and captive populations to advance comparative auditory research.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.08.681257v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-09T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:42:30.176988","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","biology","cutting-edge","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":217,"author":"Joseph, L., Colon-Rivera, N., New, E.
