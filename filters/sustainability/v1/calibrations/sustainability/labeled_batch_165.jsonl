Extending this paradigm to graphs requires a tokenization scheme that handles non-Euclidean structures and multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Existing approaches to graph tokenization, linearized, continuous, and quantized, remain limited in adaptability and efficiency. In particular, most current quantization-based tokenizers organize hierarchical information in fixed or task-agnostic ways, which may either over-represent or under-utilize structural cues, and lack the ability to dynamically reweight contributions from different levels without retraining the encoder. This work presents a hierarchical quantization framework that introduces a self-weighted mechanism for task-adaptive aggregation across multiple scales. The proposed method maintains a frozen encoder while modulating information flow through a lightweight gating process, enabling parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines under comparable computational budgets.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12369","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.362962","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csir","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Yang Xiang, Li Fan, Chenke Yin, Chengtao Ji","raw_content_length":1335,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["vision foundation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1334,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Hierarchical Quantized Tokenization Framework","Task","arXiv251012369v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent progress","language and vision foundation models","the importance","discrete token interfaces","complex inputs","compact sequences"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Hierarchical Quantized Tokenization Framework":2.0,"Task":2.0,"arXiv251012369v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent progress":1.0,"language and vision foundation models":1.0,"the importance":1.0,"discrete token interfaces":1.0,"complex inputs":1.0,"compact sequences":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7413059675,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.200999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8402,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8846,"joy":0.0216,"surprise":0.0512,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.0112,"anger":0.0202,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel hierarchical quantization framework for graph tokenization, improving efficiency and adaptability in language and vision models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2a51777edd36","title":"Controlling Intent Expressiveness in Robot Motion with Diffusion Models","content":"arXiv:2510.12370v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches to legible motion usually produce only a single \"most legible\" trajectory, overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts. In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA.

In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks, not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive. Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12376","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.363824","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cslg","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Sharath M Shankaranarayana, Soumava Kumar Roy, Prasad Sudhakar, Chandan Aladahalli","raw_content_length":1440,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1439,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Deep Attention","arXiv251012376v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","deep neural networks","impressive gains","performance","these improvements","the cost","increased computational complexity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Deep Attention":2.0,"arXiv251012376v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"deep neural networks":1.0,"impressive gains":1.0,"performance":1.0,"these improvements":1.0,"the cost":1.0,"increased computational complexity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.741335018333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.43,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.886,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8986,"joy":0.008,"surprise":0.0484,"sadness":0.0163,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0093},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a novel learnable subsampling framework for deep neural networks, aiming to reduce computational complexity and expense.

To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them, Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving the highest F1 scores.

The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps.

SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models, which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations, resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12387","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.365832","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Wenjing Bian, Axel Barroso-Laguna, Tommaso Cavallari, Victor Adrian Prisacariu, Eric Brachmann","raw_content_length":1157,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Scene Coordinate Reconstruction","SCR"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1156,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SCR models","Scene Coordinate Reconstruction Priors","arXiv251012387v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Scene coordinate regression","powerful implicit scene representations","3D vision","visual relocalization","structure","motion"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SCR models":4.0,"Scene Coordinate Reconstruction Priors":2.0,"arXiv251012387v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Scene coordinate regression":1.0,"powerful implicit scene representations":1.0,"3D vision":1.0,"visual relocalization":1.0,"structure":1.0,"motion":1.0}},"age_hours":2.741410510277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9289,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0221,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0108},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach to scene coordinate regression using probabilistic priors and a diffusion model.

This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols, followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities: Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency, while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12389","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.366234","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","research","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Hailay Kidu Teklehaymanot, Wolfgang Nejdl","raw_content_length":1677,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Subword Systems Create Inequities in LLM Access and Efficiency arXiv:2510.12389v1 Announce Type","Tokenization Disparities","Relative Tokenization Cost","Tokens Per Sentence","RTC"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1676,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Tokenization Disparities","Infrastructure Bias","Subword Systems","Inequities","LLM Access","Efficiency","new Abstract","Tokenization disparities","a significant barrier","equitable access"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM Access"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Tokenization Disparities":2.0,"Infrastructure Bias":2.0,"Subword Systems":2.0,"Inequities":2.0,"LLM Access":2.0,"Efficiency":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Tokenization disparities":1.0,"a significant barrier":1.0,"equitable access":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7414250458333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.221,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8442,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8225,"joy":0.0124,"surprise":0.0489,"sadness":0.0189,"fear":0.0204,"anger":0.0528,"disgust":0.0242},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":7,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies tokenization inefficiencies in LLMs that disproportionately affect low-resource languages, leading to increased computational costs and reduced context utilization.

Recent GBC methods often employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1) self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking, which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT have shown potential for URL analysis tasks, three limitations persist in current implementations: (1) inability to effectively model the non-natural hierarchical structure of URLs, (2) insufficient sensitivity to character-level obfuscation, and (3) lack of mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary network-level signals such as IP addresses-all essential for robust detection. To address these challenges, we propose CURL-IP, an advanced multi-modal detection framework incorporating three key innovations: (1) Token-Contrastive Representation Enhancer, which enhances subword token representations through token-aware contrastive learning to produce more discriminative and isotropic embeddings; (2) Cross-Layer Multi-Scale Aggregator, employing hierarchical aggregation of Transformer outputs via convolutional operations and gated MLPs to capture both local and global semantic patterns across layers; and (3) Blockwise Multi-Modal Coupler that decomposes URL-IP features into localized block units and computes cross-modal attention weights at the block level, enabling fine-grained inter-modal interaction. This architecture enables simultaneous preservation of fine-grained lexical cues, contextual semantics, and integration of network-level signals.

Despite its transformative potential, the effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models, establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12399","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.370122","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":231,"author":"Yuyao Ge, Lingrui Mei, Zenghao Duan, Tianhao Li, Yujia Zheng, Yiwei Wang, Lexin Wang, Jiayu Yao, Tianyu Liu, Yujun Cai, Baolong Bi, Fangda Guo, Jiafeng Guo, Shenghua Liu, Xueqi Cheng","raw_content_length":1886,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.155,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1885,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Vibe Coding","A Survey","Large Language Models","arXiv251012399v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The advancement","large language models","LLMs","a paradigm shift","code generation assistance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Vibe Coding":3.0,"A Survey":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251012399v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The advancement":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"a paradigm shift":1.0,"code generation assistance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7414824541666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6791,"joy":0.0348,"surprise":0.0644,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.1398,"anger":0.0416,"disgust":0.0335},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a survey of research on \"Vibe Coding\" using large language models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1711ddf2105c","title":"Enhanced Pre","content":"arXiv:2510.12401v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal with the semantic mismatch.

These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12405","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.372210","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cslg","research","cond-matmtrl-sci","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":161,"author":"Masahiro Negishi, Hyunsoo Park, Kinga O.

Simulated Adiabatic Bifurcation (aSB) is a quantum-inspired algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to largescale CO problems written in the Ising form. It explores the solution space by emulating the adiabatic evolution of a network of Kerr-nonlinear parametric oscillators (KPOs), where each oscillator represents a variable in the problem. The optimal solution corresponds to the ground state of this system. A key advantage of this approach is the possibility of updating multiple variables simultaneously, making it particularly suited for hardware implementation. To enhance solution quality and convergence speed, variations of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature, including ballistic (bSB), discrete (dSB), and thermal (HbSB) versions. In this work, we have comprehensively analyzed dSB, bSB, and HbSB using dedicated software models, evaluating the feasibility of using a fixed-point representation for hardware implementation. We then present an opensource hardware architecture implementing the dSB algorithm for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The design allows users to adjust the degree of algorithmic parallelization based on their specific requirements.

Specifically, we analyze the practical security of a scheme proposed by Hu et. al. for latent diffusion models, which is both robust and practically undetectable when steganalysis is performed on generated images. We show that after embedding, the Stego (latent) vector is distributed on a hypersphere while the Cover vector is i.i.d. Gaussian. By going from the image space to the latent space, we show that it is possible to model the norm of the vector in the latent space under the Cover or Stego hypothesis as Gaussian distributions with different variances. A Likelihood Ratio Test is then derived to perform pooled steganalysis. The impact of the potential knowledge of the prompt and the number of diffusion steps, is also studied.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2a6418b705a2","title":"VideoLucy: Deep Memory Backtracking for Long Video Understanding","content":"arXiv:2510.12422v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding. EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as GPT-4o.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_30dba5ec8cdf","title":"MTOS: A LLM","content":"arXiv:2510.12423v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models, meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation (MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory, incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS, varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource competition.

However, existing KH-based RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning, non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation; (ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive, multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation (G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop reasoning tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12434","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.378194","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Xiangjun Zai, Xingyu Tan, Xiaoyang Wang, Qing Liu, Xiwei Xu, Wenjie Zhang","raw_content_length":1436,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RAG","Directed"],"persons":["Knowledge Hypergraphs"],"locations":["PRoH"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1435,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Knowledge Hypergraphs","PRoH","Dynamic Planning","Reasoning","Retrieval","arXiv251012434v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","KHs","a knowledge representation"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Knowledge Hypergraphs":3.0,"PRoH":2.0,"Dynamic Planning":2.0,"Reasoning":2.0,"Retrieval":2.0,"arXiv251012434v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"KHs":1.0,"a knowledge representation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.741715635,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.8685,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2263,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8665,"joy":0.0125,"surprise":0.0347,"sadness":0.0302,"fear":0.0137,"anger":0.0179,"disgust":0.0246},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a new framework (PRoH) for knowledge hypergraph-based retrieval-augmented generation.

As these codes are under active development, the necessity to detect performance degradation early in the development process becomes apparent. In addition, having meaningful insight into application scaling behavior tightly coupled to the development workflow is helpful. In this paper, we introduce TALP-Pages, an easy-to-integrate framework that enables developers to get fast and in-repository feedback about their code performance using established fundamental performance and scaling factors. The framework relies on TALP, which enables the on-the-fly collection of these metrics. Based on a folder structure suited for CI which contains the files generated by TALP, TALP-Pages generates an HTML report with visualizations of the performance factor regression as well as scaling-efficiency tables. We compare TALP-Pages to tracing-based tools in terms of overhead and post-processing requirements and find that TALP-Pages can produce the scaling-efficiency tables faster and under tighter resource constraints. To showcase the ease of use and effectiveness of this approach, we extend the current CI setup of GENE-X with only minimal changes required and showcase the ability to detect and explain a performance improvement.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12436","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.378615","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","csdc","cspf","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Valentin Seitz, Jordy Trilaksono, Marta Garcia-Gasulla","raw_content_length":1375,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["HPC","HTML"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1374,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["TALP-Pages","the development","arXiv251012436v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","good performance","a key aspect","codes","HPC machines","these codes","active development"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["the development","active development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"TALP-Pages":3.0,"the development":2.0,"arXiv251012436v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"good performance":1.0,"a key aspect":1.0,"codes":1.0,"HPC machines":1.0,"these codes":1.0,"active development":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7417305391666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.417,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8834,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.906,"joy":0.0584,"surprise":0.0156,"sadness":0.0033,"fear":0.0046,"anger":0.0066,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a framework (TALP-Pages) for detecting performance degradation in HPC codes, which can indirectly improve energy efficiency by optimizing code performance.

To alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches, however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements. Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a foundation for advancing this emerging field.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12444","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.379531","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":221,"author":"Shaoyang Zhou, Yingshu Li, Yunyi Liu, Lingqiao Liu, Lei Wang, Luping Zhou","raw_content_length":1754,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.105,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Performance Evaluation arXiv:2510.12444v1 Announce Type","CXRRRG","Chest Xray","CXR RRG","A Review of Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation: Dataset Composition"],"persons":["Chest Xray"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1753,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Longitudinal Radiology","Dataset Composition","Methods","Performance Evaluation","arXiv251012444v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Chest Xray imaging","a widely used diagnostic tool","modern medicine","its high utilization"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Longitudinal Radiology":2.0,"Dataset Composition":2.0,"Methods":2.0,"Performance Evaluation":2.0,"arXiv251012444v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Chest Xray imaging":1.0,"a widely used diagnostic tool":1.0,"modern medicine":1.0,"its high utilization":1.0}},"age_hours":2.741759756388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.6715,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.1343,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8763,"joy":0.0442,"surprise":0.0419,"sadness":0.0088,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0063},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reviews methods for longitudinal radiology report generation, aiming to reduce radiologist workload.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_2fdad6205f1a","title":"Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning","content":"arXiv:2510.12447v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies. However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) -- a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue, while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic pricing in complex, uncertain environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.380380","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Anush Anand, Pranav Agrawal, Tejas Bodas","raw_content_length":1711,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning arXiv:2510.12447v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1710,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Bayesian Optimization","Dynamic Pricing","Learning","arXiv251012447v1","new Abstract","Dynamic pricing","the practice","the selling price","a product","a firms revenue"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Bayesian Optimization":2.0,"Dynamic Pricing":2.0,"Learning":2.0,"arXiv251012447v1":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Dynamic pricing":1.0,"the practice":1.0,"the selling price":1.0,"a product":1.0,"a firms revenue":1.0}},"age_hours":2.741790875,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.202,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4404,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.937,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0184,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0076,"anger":0.0167,"disgust":0.0109},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":5,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel algorithm (Bayesian Optimization) for dynamic pricing, which could indirectly reduce waste and improve resource allocation, but the direct climate impact is theoretical.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1a6b3252e1f1","title":"A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima","content":"arXiv:2510.12451v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation), calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.380806","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cslg","research","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":180,"author":"Israel Mason-Williams, Gabryel Mason-Williams, Helen Yannakoudakis","raw_content_length":1330,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.9,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SAM","Sharp"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1329,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Function Centric Perspective","Flat and Sharp Minima","sharpness","arXiv251012451v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Flat minima","improved generalisation","deep neural networks","this connection","recent studies"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["deep neural networks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Function Centric Perspective":2.0,"Flat and Sharp Minima":2.0,"sharpness":2.0,"arXiv251012451v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Flat minima":1.0,"improved generalisation":1.0,"deep neural networks":1.0,"this connection":1.0,"recent studies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7418054183333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9203,"joy":0.0145,"surprise":0.0179,"sadness":0.0029,"fear":0.0139,"anger":0.0167,"disgust":0.0138},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the relationship between sharpness of minima in neural networks and their generalization performance, finding that sharper minima can coincide with better performance under regularization.

In the context of optimal stopping, we work with an aggregation preference to incorporate all discount rates via an attitude function that reflects the aggregation rule chosen by the central planner. The problem formulation is also applicable to single agent's stopping problem with uncertain discount rate, where our aggregation preference coincides with the conventional smooth ambiguity preference. The resulting optimal stopping problem is time inconsistent, for which we develop an iterative approach using consistent planning and characterize all time-consistent mild equilibria as fixed points of an operator in the setting of one-dimensional diffusion processes. We provide some sufficient conditions on the underlying models and the attitude function such that the smallest mild equilibrium attains the optimal equilibrium. In addition, we show that the optimal equilibrium is a weak equilibrium. When the sufficient condition of the attitude function is violated, we illustrate by various examples that the characterization of the optimal equilibrium may differ significantly from some existing results for a single agent, which now sensitively depends on the attitude function and the diversity distribution of discount rates within the group.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07470","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:40:03.134950","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathematics","mathoc","q-finmf","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Shuoqing Deng, Xiang Yu, Jiacheng Zhang","raw_content_length":1429,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1428,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["time","arXiv230207470v4","replace-cross","Abstract","a central planners decision making","behalf","a group","members","diverse discount rates","the context"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"time":2.0,"arXiv230207470v4":1.0,"replace-cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a central planners decision making":1.0,"behalf":1.0,"a group":1.0,"members":1.0,"diverse discount rates":1.0,"the context":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7625858766666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2850000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.743,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7987,"joy":0.0527,"surprise":0.1237,"sadness":0.0084,"fear":0.0055,"anger":0.0091,"disgust":0.0019},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical research on decision-making under diverse discount rates, which could potentially inform future sustainability policies.

Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to maintain high accuracy across both frequent and rare attacks, leading to increased false negatives for minority classes. To address this, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection framework that integrates specialized deep learning models with an ensemble meta-classifier. Each model is trained to detect a specific attack category, enabling tailored learning of class-specific patterns, while their collective outputs are fused by a Random Forest meta-classifier to improve overall decision reliability. The framework is evaluated on the NSL-KDD benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in handling class imbalance compared to conventional monolithic models. Results show significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score across all attack categories, including rare classes such as User to Root (U2R). The proposed system achieves near-perfect detection rates with minimal false alarms, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. This work advances the design of intrusion detection systems by combining specialization with ensemble learning, providing an effective and scalable solution for safeguarding modern networks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12455","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.381606","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Nisith Dissanayake (University of Moratuwa), Uthayasanker Thayasivam (University of Moratuwa)","raw_content_length":1431,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NSL","Random Forest"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1430,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Attack","arXiv251012455v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The growing scale","sophistication","cyberattacks","critical challenges","security","diverse intrusion types","imbalanced datasets"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Attack":2.0,"arXiv251012455v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The growing scale":1.0,"sophistication":1.0,"cyberattacks":1.0,"critical challenges":1.0,"security":1.0,"diverse intrusion types":1.0,"imbalanced datasets":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7418340975,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.8755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6249,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8062,"joy":0.0033,"surprise":0.0564,"sadness":0.0152,"fear":0.0896,"anger":0.0233,"disgust":0.006},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel hybrid anomaly detection framework for cybersecurity.

However, existing RAG systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory, particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge, and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under diverse conflict conditions.

However, the impartiality of these AI \"judges\" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e., GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11 types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores. Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12462","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.383843","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","computer-science","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Jiaxin Gao, Chen Chen, Yanwen Jia, Xueluan Gong, Kwok-Yan Lam, Qian Wang","raw_content_length":1395,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["GPT","LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1394,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Mitigating LLM","arXiv251012462v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","LLMs","the quality","content","communication systems","responses","telecom customer support chatbots"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Mitigating LLM","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Mitigating LLM":2.0,"arXiv251012462v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"the quality":1.0,"content":1.0,"communication systems":1.0,"responses":1.0,"telecom customer support chatbots":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7418939580555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7814,"joy":0.0214,"surprise":0.0269,"sadness":0.013,"fear":0.0834,"anger":0.0528,"disgust":0.0212},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":5,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates biases in LLMs used for content evaluation, showing they are generally robust to biased inputs, especially with detailed rubrics.

Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However, accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12463","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.384252","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Nikoleta Pantelidou, Evelina Leivada, Paolo Morosi","raw_content_length":1419,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.985,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1418,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Resource","arXiv251012463v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The linguistic abilities","Large Language Models","a matter","ongoing debate","This study","this discussion","model performance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"],"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Resource":2.0,"arXiv251012463v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The linguistic abilities":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"a matter":1.0,"ongoing debate":1.0,"This study":1.0,"this discussion":1.0,"model performance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.741908381388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8676,"joy":0.047,"surprise":0.0539,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.006,"anger":0.0132,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research explores the linguistic abilities of large language models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_286116c4faf5","title":"Proof of Cloud: Data Center Execution Assurance for Confidential VMs","content":"arXiv:2510.12469v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) protect data in use by running workloads inside hardware-isolated environments. In doing so, they also inherit the limitations of the underlying hardware. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which enforce this isolation, explicitly exclude adversaries with physical access from their threat model. Commercial TEEs, e.g., Intel TDX, thus assume infrastructure providers do not physically exploit hardware and serve as safeguards instead. This creates a tension: tenants must trust provider integrity at the hardware layer, yet existing remote attestation offers no way to verify that CVMs actually run on physically trusted platforms, leaving today's CVM deployments unable to demonstrate that their guarantees align with the TEE vendor's threat model. We bridge this confidence gap with Data Center Execution Assurance (DCEA), a design generating \"Proofs of Cloud\". DCEA binds a CVM to its underlying platform using vTPM-anchored measurements, ensuring CVM launch evidence and TPM quotes refer to the same physical chassis. This takes advantage of the fact that data centers are often identifiable via TPMs. Our approach applies to CVMs accessing vTPMs and running on top of software stacks fully controlled by the cloud provider, as well as single-tenant bare-metal deployments with discrete TPMs. We trust providers for integrity (certificate issuance), but not for the confidentiality of CVM-visible state.

Yet, this ability also heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In this paper, we introduce \\dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation to the \\textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized text. Based on this finding, we propose \\method, a simple and reliable way to predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \\method identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector dependence. Our experiments show that \\method can accurately predict both the direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\\% correlation with the actual performance gaps.

Given that time series data can exhibit different patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies. Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12489","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.389228","language":"en","tags":["preprints","statml","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Beibu Li, Qichao Shentu, Yang Shu, Hui Zhang, Ming Li, Ning Jin, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo","raw_content_length":1384,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Cross"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1383,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["CrossAD Time Series Anomaly Detection","Cross","arXiv251012489v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Time series anomaly detection","a crucial role","a wide range","real-world applications","that time","series data"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"CrossAD Time Series Anomaly Detection":2.0,"Cross":2.0,"arXiv251012489v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Time series anomaly detection":1.0,"a crucial role":1.0,"a wide range":1.0,"real-world applications":1.0,"that time":1.0,"series data":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7420724794444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9298,"joy":0.0108,"surprise":0.0378,"sadness":0.0039,"fear":0.0066,"anger":0.0079,"disgust":0.0031},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel anomaly detection framework (CrossAD) for time series data, which could potentially improve the efficiency of various systems, including those related to energy consumption and industrial processes.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ef1b7d8d6983","title":"PubSub","content":"arXiv:2510.12494v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency. Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency, while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system efficiency.

In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of mainstream diffusion models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12497","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.390864","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Jincheng Zhong, Boyuan Jiang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Kun Gai, Mingsheng Long","raw_content_length":1301,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Noise Awareness Guidance","Noise Awareness Guidance arXiv:2510.12497v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1300,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the Noise Shift","Generative Models","Noise Awareness Guidance","arXiv251012497v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Existing denoising generative models","discretized reverse-time SDEs","ODEs","this paper","a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the Noise Shift":2.0,"Generative Models":2.0,"Noise Awareness Guidance":2.0,"arXiv251012497v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Existing denoising generative models":1.0,"discretized reverse-time SDEs":1.0,"ODEs":1.0,"this paper":1.0,"a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7421311619444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8724,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0309,"sadness":0.0179,"fear":0.0288,"anger":0.0175,"disgust":0.0278},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method (NAG) to improve the quality of generative models by addressing noise shift.

Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and clinically relevant endpoints.

Proper pruning can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed workflow on a real-world robot.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_e1a43d7ba9b8","title":"Why the noise model matters: A performance gap in learned regularization","content":"arXiv:2510.12521v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of learning effective regularizers for linear inverse problems. We analyze and compare several types of learned variational regularization against the theoretical benchmark of the optimal affine reconstruction, i.e. the best possible affine linear map for minimizing the mean squared error. It is known that this optimal reconstruction can be achieved using Tikhonov regularization, but this requires precise knowledge of the noise covariance to properly weight the data fidelity term. However, in many practical applications, noise statistics are unknown. We therefore investigate the performance of regularization methods learned without access to this noise information, focusing on Tikhonov, Lavrentiev, and quadratic regularization. Our theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that for non-white noise, a performance gap emerges between these methods and the optimal affine reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that these different types of regularization yield distinct results, highlighting that the choice of regularizer structure is critical when the noise model is not explicitly learned. Our findings underscore the significant value of accurately modeling or co-learning noise statistics in data-driven regularization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12521","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.393642","language":"en","tags":["preprints","mathna","csna","computer-science","cslg","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":178,"author":"Sebastian Banert, Christoph Brauer, Dirk Lorenz, Lionel Tondji","raw_content_length":1335,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["linear"],"persons":["Lavrentiev"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1334,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the noise model","A performance gap","learned regularization","Announce Type","new Abstract","This article","the challenge","effective regularizers","linear inverse problems","several types"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the noise model":2.0,"A performance gap":2.0,"learned regularization":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This article":1.0,"the challenge":1.0,"effective regularizers":1.0,"linear inverse problems":1.0,"several types":1.0}},"age_hours":2.742219031111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.13,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.826,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8357,"joy":0.0259,"surprise":0.039,"sadness":0.0244,"fear":0.0284,"anger":0.0317,"disgust":0.015},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on learned regularization methods for linear inverse problems.

Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems. This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied perception applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12528","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.394845","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsapp-ph","computer-science","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Muxing Huang, Zibin Chen, Weiliang Xu, Zilan Li, Yuanzhi Zhou, Guoyuan Zhou, Wenjing Chen, Xinming Li","raw_content_length":1575,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CNN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1574,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Two-stream network","Announce Type","new Abstract","Tactile perception","embodied intelligent robots","objects","Vision-based tactile sensors","object physical attributes","high spatial resolution","this process"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Two-stream network":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Tactile perception":1.0,"embodied intelligent robots":1.0,"objects":1.0,"Vision-based tactile sensors":1.0,"object physical attributes":1.0,"high spatial resolution":1.0,"this process":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7422618791666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.825000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.765,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6601,"joy":0.0034,"surprise":0.0155,"sadness":0.0604,"fear":0.0763,"anger":0.0691,"disgust":0.1152},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a two-stream network for tactile perception in robots, achieving 98.5% object recognition accuracy in grasping scenarios.

Existing prototype-based models offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity (sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence, and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12534","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.395233","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Utsav Kumar Nareti, Suraj Kumar, Soumya Pandey, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Chandranath Adak","raw_content_length":1420,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Learning Semi arXiv:2510.12534v1 Announce"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1419,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251012534v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The surge","user-generated reviews","the need","interpretable models","fine-grained insights","Existing prototype-based models","intuitive explanations","coarse granularity"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["fine-grained insights"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251012534v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The surge":1.0,"user-generated reviews":1.0,"the need":1.0,"interpretable models":1.0,"fine-grained insights":1.0,"Existing prototype-based models":1.0,"intuitive explanations":1.0,"coarse granularity":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7422762516666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.7570000000000001,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.6486,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.906,"joy":0.0091,"surprise":0.0523,"sadness":0.0074,"fear":0.0077,"anger":0.011,"disgust":0.0064},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new framework, ProtoSiTex, for interpretable multi-label text classification.

In rural areas, road side units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and coding scheme ($\\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\\mathrm{t}}$) should be configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by the packet receive ratio ($\\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication distance $D_{\\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy traffic, increasing $P_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\\mathrm{MCS}$ at $\\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\\mathrm{comm}}$, albeit with higher energy cost.

Although SE research has increasingly recognised empathy as a key human aspect, there remains no validated instrument specifically designed to measure it within the unique socio-technical contexts of SE. Existing generic empathy scales, while well-established in psychology and healthcare, often rely on language, scenarios, and assumptions that are not meaningful or interpretable for software practitioners. These scales fail to account for the diverse, role-specific, and domain-bound expressions of empathy in SE, such as understanding a non-technical user's frustrations or another practitioner's technical constraints, which differ substantially from empathy in clinical or everyday contexts. To address this gap, we developed and validated two domain-specific empathy scales: EmpathiSEr-P, assessing empathy among practitioners, and EmpathiSEr-U, capturing practitioner empathy towards users. Grounded in a practitioner-informed conceptual framework, the scales encompass three dimensions of empathy: cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and empathic responses. We followed a rigorous, multi-phase methodology, including expert evaluation, cognitive interviews, and two practitioner surveys. The resulting instruments represent the first psychometrically validated empathy scales tailored to SE, offering researchers and practitioners a tool for assessing empathy and designing empathy-enhancing interventions in software teams and user interactions.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12546","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.396969","language":"en","tags":["preprints","computer-science","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":204,"author":"Hashini Gunatilake, John Grundy, Rashina Hoda, Ingo Mueller","raw_content_length":1634,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.02,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1633,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The EmpathiSEr","Development","Validation","Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales","new Abstract","Empathy","a critical role","software engineering","collaboration","communication"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Development","Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales","software engineering"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The EmpathiSEr":2.0,"Development":2.0,"Validation":2.0,"Software Engineering Oriented Empathy Scales":2.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Empathy":1.0,"a critical role":1.0,"software engineering":1.0,"collaboration":1.0,"communication":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7423358763888888,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":3.79,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.242,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8895,"joy":0.0206,"surprise":0.0474,"sadness":0.0082,"fear":0.0134,"anger":0.0159,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a validated tool for measuring empathy in software engineering.

Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9a87e9da7272","title":"Exact Matching and Top","content":"arXiv:2510.12552v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Exact Matching (EM) problem asks whether there exists a perfect matching which uses a prescribed number of red edges in a red/blue edge-colored graph. While there exists a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the problem, only some special cases admit a deterministic one so far, making it a natural candidate for testing the P=RP hypothesis. A polynomial-time equivalent problem, Top-k Perfect Matching (TkPM), asks for a perfect matching maximizing the weight of the $k$ heaviest edges. We study the above problems, mainly the latter, in the scenario where the input is a blown-up graph, meaning a graph which had its vertices replaced by cliques or independent sets. We describe an FPT algorithm for TkPM parameterized by $k$ and the neighborhood diversity of the input graph, which is essentially the size of the graph before the blow-up; this graph is also called the prototype. We extend this algorithm into an approximation scheme with a much softer dependency on the aforementioned parameters, time-complexity wise. Moreover, for prototypes with bounded bandwidth but unbounded size, we develop a recursive algorithm that runs in subexponential time. Utilizing another algorithm for EM on bounded neighborhood diversity graphs, we adapt this recursive subexponential algorithm to EM. Our approach is similar to the use of dynamic programming on e.g. bounded treewidth instances for various problems. The main point is that the existence of many disjoint separators is utilized to avoid including in the separator any of a set of ``bad'' vertices during the split phase.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12552","published_date":"2025-10-15T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-15T06:39:20.398228","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscc","computer-science","research","csds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":252,"author":"Nicolas El Maalouly, Kostas Lakis","raw_content_length":1638,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.26,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TkPM","FPT"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1633,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Exact Matching","Top","arXiv251012552v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a perfect matching","which","a prescribed number","red edges","a redblue edge-colored graph","a randomized polynomial-time algorithm"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["a randomized polynomial-time algorithm"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Exact Matching":2.0,"Top":2.0,"arXiv251012552v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a perfect matching":1.0,"which":1.0,"a prescribed number":1.0,"red edges":1.0,"a redblue edge-colored graph":1.0,"a randomized polynomial-time algorithm":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7423812436111112,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.511000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9022,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.912,"joy":0.0144,"surprise":0.0531,"sadness":0.006,"fear":0.0038,"anger":0.0067,"disgust":0.004},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents theoretical algorithms for solving graph matching problems.
