{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d746ddf65ff2","title":"ViConEx","content":"arXiv:2510.10174v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts.

While these systems have achieved promising results, the availability of detailed music scores is limited compared to MIDI files and are less flexible to work with using a digital audio workstation (DAW). Recent advancements in low-informed EPR systems offer a more accessible alternative by directly utilizing score-derived MIDI as input, but these systems often exhibit suboptimal performance. Meanwhile, existing works are evaluated with diverse automatic metrics and data formats, hindering direct objective comparisons between EPR systems. In this study, we introduce Peransformer, a transformer-based low-informed EPR system designed to bridge the gap between low-informed and highly-informed EPR systems. Our approach incorporates a score-aware discriminator that leverages the underlying score-derived MIDI files and is trained on a score-to-performance paired, note-to-note aligned MIDI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that Peransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance among low-informed systems, as validated by subjective evaluations. Furthermore, we extend existing automatic evaluation metrics for EPR systems and introduce generalized EPR metrics (GEM), enabling more direct, accurate, and reliable comparisons across EPR systems.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10175","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.654361","language":"en","tags":["eessas","preprints","research","cssd","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Xian He, Wei Zeng, Ye Wang","raw_content_length":1476,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DAW","EPR"],"persons":["Peransformer"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1475,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Peransformer","Improving Low","arXiv251010175v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Highly-informed Expressive Performance Rendering EPR systems","music scores","rich musical annotations","human-like expressive performance MIDI files","these systems","promising results"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Peransformer":2.0,"Improving Low":2.0,"arXiv251010175v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Highly-informed Expressive Performance Rendering EPR systems":1.0,"music scores":1.0,"rich musical annotations":1.0,"human-like expressive performance MIDI files":1.0,"these systems":1.0,"promising results":1.0}},"age_hours":2.748941123888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.861,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7722,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9215,"joy":0.019,"surprise":0.0391,"sadness":0.0055,"fear":0.0035,"anger":0.0059,"disgust":0.0056},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a new algorithm (Peransformer) for generating expressive music performances from MIDI files.

Drawing on Jacques Ranci\\`ere's theory of intellectual emancipation, this paper examines how generative AI risks becoming a \"mechanical yes-man\" that reinforces passivity rather than fostering intellectual autonomy. Generative AI's statistical logic and lack of causal reasoning, combined with frictionless information access, threatens to hollow out cognitive processes essential for genuine learning. This creates a critical paradox: while generative AI systems are trained for complex reasoning, students increasingly use them to bypass the intellectual work that builds such capabilities. The paper critiques both techno-optimistic and restrictive approaches to generative AI in education, proposing instead an emancipatory pedagogy grounded in verification, mastery, and co-inquiry. This framework positions generative AI as material for intellectual work rather than a substitute for it, emphasising the cultivation of metacognitive awareness and critical interrogation of AI outputs. It requires educators to engage directly with these tools to guide students toward critical AI literacy, transforming pedagogical authority from explication to critical interloping that models intellectual courage and collaborative inquiry.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10176","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.654781","language":"en","tags":["cscy","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Linda Rocco","raw_content_length":1415,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Large Language Models"],"persons":["Jacques"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1414,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Mechanical","Yes","arXiv251010176v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The proliferation","Large Language Models","higher education","a fundamental challenge","traditional pedagogical frameworks","Jacques"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Mechanical":2.0,"Yes":2.0,"arXiv251010176v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The proliferation":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"higher education":1.0,"a fundamental challenge":1.0,"traditional pedagogical frameworks":1.0,"Jacques":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7489551091666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3605,"joy":0.0113,"surprise":0.024,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.5541,"anger":0.0301,"disgust":0.0099},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the impact of AI on education and proposes a new pedagogical framework.

However, current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates.

Improving Fuzz Testing for MOJO with Large Language Models","content":"arXiv:2510.10179v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized software testing, particularly fuzz testing, by automating the generation of diverse and effective test inputs. This advancement holds great promise for improving software reliability. Meanwhile, the introduction of MOJO, a high-performance AI programming language blending Python's usability with the efficiency of C and C++, presents new opportunities to enhance AI model scalability and programmability. However, as a new language, MOJO lacks comprehensive testing frameworks and a sufficient corpus for LLM-based testing, which exacerbates model hallucination. In this case, LLMs will generate syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code, significantly reducing the effectiveness of fuzz testing. To address this challenge, we propose MOJOFuzzer, the first adaptive LLM-based fuzzing framework designed for zero-shot learning environments of emerging programming languages. MOJOFuzzer integrates a mutil-phase framework that systematically eliminates low-quality generated inputs before execution, significantly improving test case validity. Furthermore, MOJOFuzzer dynamically adapts LLM prompts based on runtime feedback for test case mutation, enabling an iterative learning process that continuously enhances fuzzing efficiency and bug detection performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that MOJOFuzzer significantly enhances test validity, API coverage, and bug detection performance, outperforming traditional fuzz testing and state-of-the-art LLM-based fuzzing approaches. Using MOJOFuzzer, we have conducted a first large-scale fuzz testing evaluation of MOJO, uncorvering 13 previous unknown bugs. This study not only advances the field of LLM-driven software testing but also establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging LLMs in the testing of emerging programming languages.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10179","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.655615","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":247,"author":"Linghan Huang, Peizhou Zhao, Huaming Chen","raw_content_length":1937,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.235,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Python","LLM","Large Language Models arXiv:2510.10179v1","MOJO"],"persons":["C++"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1936,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","MOJO","All","You","Fuzz Testing","Large Language Models","Announce Type","new Abstract","The rapid development","large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models","large language models"],"engineering":["The rapid development"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":3.0,"MOJO":3.0,"All":2.0,"You":2.0,"Fuzz Testing":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The rapid development":1.0,"large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7489863033333335,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.6685,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9337,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8314,"joy":0.0755,"surprise":0.0679,"sadness":0.0018,"fear":0.0037,"anger":0.0136,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach to fuzz testing using LLMs, specifically for the MOJO programming language.

Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings, environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and method.

EFN automatically identifies contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align with past successful behaviors under current observations.

Among all the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types, which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs. First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then, current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks, providing a solid foundation for future research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10182","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.656812","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Kedi Chen, Dezhao Ruan, Yuhao Dan, Yaoting Wang, Siyu Yan, Xuecheng Wu, Yinqi Zhang, Qin Chen, Jie Zhou, Liang He, Biqing Qi, Linyang Li, Qipeng Guo, Xiaoming Shi, Wei Zhang","raw_content_length":1168,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.81,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1167,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Survey","Inductive Reasoning","Large Language Models","arXiv251010182v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Reasoning","an important task","large language models","LLMs","all the reasoning paradigms"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Survey":2.0,"Inductive Reasoning":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251010182v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Reasoning":1.0,"an important task":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"all the reasoning paradigms":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749032218611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.859499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5719,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8317,"joy":0.0351,"surprise":0.0869,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0158,"anger":0.0148,"disgust":0.0096},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper is a survey of inductive reasoning in LLMs. While improved AI reasoning could indirectly contribute to sustainability by optimizing various processes, this paper itself does not present any concrete actions or measurable outcomes related to climate change or sustainability.

This practice treats their internal collaborative processes as opaque \"black boxes\" and overlooks a critical question: is a diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway? The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600 cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks. Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns: flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the responsible development and deployment of medical AI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10185","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.657216","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csma","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Lei Gu, Yinghao Zhu, Haoran Sang, Zixiang Wang, Dehao Sui, Wen Tang, Ewen Harrison, Junyi Gao, Lequan Yu, Liantao Ma","raw_content_length":1402,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Medical Multi arXiv:2510.10185v1 Announce"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1401,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["MedAgentAudit","Diagnosing","Quantifying Collaborative Failure Modes","Medical Multi","arXiv251010185v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","large language model","promise","medical consultations","their evaluation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Quantifying Collaborative Failure Modes","large language model"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"MedAgentAudit":2.0,"Diagnosing":2.0,"Quantifying Collaborative Failure Modes":2.0,"Medical Multi":2.0,"arXiv251010185v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"large language model":1.0,"promise":1.0,"medical consultations":1.0,"their evaluation":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7490473780555558,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.798,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4404,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9059,"joy":0.0061,"surprise":0.0205,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.025,"anger":0.0189,"disgust":0.0166},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies failure modes in LLM-based medical multi-agent systems, quantifying them across 3,600 cases.

Specifically, we consider three scenarios: (i) the model-based structured control, (ii) the data-driven unstructured control, and (iii) the data-driven structured control. For the $H_2$ performance, we primarily investigate cases (ii) and (iii), since case (i) has been extensively studied in the literature. For the $H_\\infty$ performance, all three scenarios are considered. For the structured control, we introduce a linearization technique that transforms the original nonconvex problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Based on this transformation, we develop an iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) algorithm. For the data-driven control, we describe the set of all possible system matrices that can generate the sequence of collected data. Additionally, we propose a sufficient condition to handle all possible system matrices using the matrix S-procedure.

We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to ground-truth annotations. We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2) stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81% overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10191","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.658995","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":203,"author":"Haohua Dong, Ana Manzano Rodr\\'iguez, Camille Guinaudeau, Shin'ichi Satoh","raw_content_length":1490,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.015,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["FairFace"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1487,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Fairness","Labels","Pseudo","arXiv251010191v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","gender classification models","demographic biases","their training data","uneven performance","gender"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Fairness"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Fairness":2.0,"Labels":2.0,"Pseudo":2.0,"arXiv251010191v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"gender classification models":1.0,"demographic biases":1.0,"their training data":1.0,"uneven performance":1.0,"gender":1.0}},"age_hours":2.74910553,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8695,"joy":0.016,"surprise":0.0221,"sadness":0.0128,"fear":0.0171,"anger":0.034,"disgust":0.0285},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":8,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel method for mitigating bias in face gender classification models.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_07c582cd7955","title":"SAFER: Risk-Constrained Sample","content":"arXiv:2510.10193v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e., the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data efficiency.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10193","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.659609","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Qingni Wang, Yue Fan, Xin Eric Wang","raw_content_length":1809,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Risk-Constrained Sample arXiv:2510.10193v1 Announce Type","SAFER","SCP"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1808,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Risk-Constrained Sample","arXiv251010193v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","large language models","LLMs","risk-sensitive applications","the trustworthiness","their outputs","Existing selective conformal prediction","SCP methods"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Risk-Constrained Sample","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Risk-Constrained Sample":2.0,"arXiv251010193v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"risk-sensitive applications":1.0,"the trustworthiness":1.0,"their outputs":1.0,"Existing selective conformal prediction":1.0,"SCP methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7491214102777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.469999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.694,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8949,"joy":0.007,"surprise":0.0182,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.0461,"anger":0.0185,"disgust":0.0115},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper introduces a new method (SAFER) for improving the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in risk-sensitive applications.

The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10194","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.660144","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":164,"author":"Feng Xiao, Hongbin Xu, Hai Ci, Wenxiong Kang","raw_content_length":1233,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.82,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Progressive Learning","Binary to N arXiv:2510.10194v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1232,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["B2N3D","Progressive Learning","Binary","arXiv251010194v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","3D objects","natural language","robotic scene understanding","The descriptions"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["natural language"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"B2N3D":2.0,"Progressive Learning":2.0,"Binary":2.0,"arXiv251010194v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"3D objects":1.0,"natural language":1.0,"robotic scene understanding":1.0,"The descriptions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749136418333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8392,"joy":0.0094,"surprise":0.0347,"sadness":0.039,"fear":0.0333,"anger":0.0277,"disgust":0.0167},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework for 3D object grounding using natural language, which could improve robotic scene understanding.

Yet most existing studies measure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is reliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social and emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative AI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they converse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool and partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale (HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational aspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative interviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United States, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor analyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent profile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing meaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust frameworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a validated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide new insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction.

However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space, and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as a reward signal.

Moreover, RLFR is able to compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation for context comprehending.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fec4e22f6fdf","title":"Performance Index Shaping for Closed","content":"arXiv:2510.10202v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The design of the performance index, also referred to as cost or reward shaping, is central to both optimal control and reinforcement learning, as it directly determines the behaviors, trade-offs, and objectives that the resulting control laws seek to achieve. A commonly used approach for this inference task in recent years is differentiable trajectory optimization, which allows gradients to be computed with respect to cost parameters by differentiating through an optimal control solver. However, this method often requires repeated solving of the underlying optimal control problem at every iteration, making the method computationally expensive. In this work, assuming known dynamics, we propose a novel framework that analytically links the performance index to the resulting closed-loop optimal control law, thereby transforming a typically bi-level inverse problem into a tractable single-level formulation. Our approach is motivated by the question: given a closed-loop control law that solves an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, how does this law change when the performance index is modified with additional terms? This formulation yields closed-form characterizations for broad classes of systems and performance indices, which not only facilitate interpretation and stability analysis, but also provide insight into the robust stability and input-to-state stable behavior of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop system. Moreover, this analytical perspective enables the generalization of our approach to diverse design objectives, yielding a unifying framework for performance index shaping. Given specific design objectives, we propose a systematic methodology to guide the shaping of the performance index and thereby design the resulting optimal control law.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10202","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.662700","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cssy","preprints","research","mathoc","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":254,"author":"Ayush Rai, Shaoshuai Mou, Brian D.

Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap.

Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution, thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled method for LLMs' controllable generation.

However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices, and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically plausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook. Experiments demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation, surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10206","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.663949","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csma","preprints","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Zuhong Liu, Junhao Ge, Minhao Xiong, Jiahao Gu, Bowei Tang, Wei Jing, Siheng Chen","raw_content_length":1337,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.795,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SMPL","Harmanoid"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1336,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251010206v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The true promise","humanoid robotics","single-agent autonomy","two or more humanoids","physically grounded socially meaningful whole-body interactions","the richness","human social interaction","single-humanoid methods"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251010206v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The true promise":1.0,"humanoid robotics":1.0,"single-agent autonomy":1.0,"two or more humanoids":1.0,"physically grounded socially meaningful whole-body interactions":1.0,"the richness":1.0,"human social interaction":1.0,"single-humanoid methods":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749274473611111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.9735000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3947,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8226,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0163,"sadness":0.0443,"fear":0.0466,"anger":0.0401,"disgust":0.02},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel motion imitation framework for dual-humanoid robots.

However, in many real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle, we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector by introducing clean and noisy LoRA.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ecdd4ea0e776","title":"Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation","content":"arXiv:2510.10211v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently, prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10211","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.666061","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Yida Xiong, Jiameng Chen, Kun Li, Hongzhi Zhang, Xiantao Cai, Wenbin Hu","raw_content_length":1698,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks for Molecular Graph Generation arXiv:2510.10211v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1697,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks","Molecular Graph Generation","Announce Type","new Abstract","Molecular graph generation","a classification generation problem","categories","atoms","bonds","prevailing paradigms"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["prevailing paradigms"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Hierarchical Bayesian Flow Networks":2.0,"Molecular Graph Generation":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Molecular graph generation":1.0,"a classification generation problem":1.0,"categories":1.0,"atoms":1.0,"bonds":1.0,"prevailing paradigms":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749351421944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8816,"joy":0.0172,"surprise":0.0594,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.0132,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for molecular graph generation using Bayesian Flow Networks.

In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework.

This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_8746c0c4a1cf","title":"Old is Gold: Optimizing Single","content":"arXiv:2510.10219v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Memory allocators hide beneath nearly every application stack, yet their performance footprint extends far beyond their code size. Even small inefficiencies in the allocators ripple through caches and the rest of the memory hierarchy, collectively imposing what operators often call a \"datacenter tax\". At hyperscale, even a 1% improvement in allocator efficiency can unlock millions of dollars in savings and measurable reductions in datacenter energy consumption. Modern memory allocators are designed to optimize allocation speed and memory fragmentation in multi-threaded environments, relying on complex metadata and control logic to achieve high performance. However, the overhead introduced by this complexity prompts a reevaluation of allocator design. Notably, such overhead can be avoided in single-threaded scenarios, which continue to be widely used across diverse application domains. In this paper, we introduce Exgen-Malloc, a memory allocator purpose-built for single-threaded applications. By specializing for single-threaded execution, Exgen-Malloc eliminates unnecessary metadata, simplifies the control flow, thereby reducing overhead and improving allocation efficiency. Its core design features include a centralized heap, a single free-block list, and a balanced strategy for memory commitment and relocation. Additionally, Exgen-Malloc incorporates design principles in modern multi-threaded allocators, which do not exist in legacy single-threaded allocators such as dlmalloc. We evaluate Exgen-Malloc on two Intel Xeon platforms. Across both systems, Exgen-Malloc achieves a speedup of 1.17x, 1.10x, and 1.93x over dlmalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively. In addition to performance, Exgen-Malloc achieves 6.2%, 0.1%, and 25.2% memory savings over mimalloc on SPEC CPU2017, redis-benchmark, and mimalloc-bench, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10219","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.668191","language":"en","tags":["research","cspl","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"Ruihao Li, Lizy K.

Our goal is to understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture. We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning. Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training, from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention formation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10221","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.668615","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":174,"author":"Hyogo Hiruma, Hiroshi Ito, Hiroki Mori, Tetsuya Ogata","raw_content_length":1353,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.87,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["$A^3 RNN$"]},"char_count":1350,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A3RNN","Bi-directional Fusion","Bottom","arXiv251010221v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This study","the developmental interaction","top-down TD","robotic learning","Our goal"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"],"engineering":["the developmental interaction"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A3RNN":2.0,"Bi-directional Fusion":2.0,"Bottom":2.0,"arXiv251010221v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"the developmental interaction":1.0,"top-down TD":1.0,"robotic learning":1.0,"Our goal":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7494408380555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8724,"joy":0.034,"surprise":0.0561,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.008,"anger":0.0148,"disgust":0.0077},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel attention model for robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.

We study label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy, indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query. These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce domains.

A recent empirical study finds that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec.

Industrial practice relies on differential testing for CPU verification, yet faces bottlenecks at nearly each stage of the framework pipeline: front-end stimulus generation lacks micro-architectural awareness, yielding low-quality and redundant tests that impede coverage closure and miss corner cases. Meanwhile, back-end simulation infrastructure, even with FPGA acceleration, often stalls on long-running tests and offers limited visibility, delaying feedback and prolonging the debugging cycle. Here, we present ISAAC, a full-stack, Large Language Model (LLM)-aided CPU verification framework with FPGA parallelism, from bug categorisation and stimulus generation to simulation infrastructure. To do so, we presented a multi-agent stimulus engine in ISAAC's front-end, infused with micro-architectural knowledge and historical bug patterns, generating highly targeted tests that rapidly achieve coverage goals and capture elusive corner cases. In ISAAC's back-end, we introduce a lightweight forward-snapshot mechanism and a decoupled co-simulation architecture between the Instruction Set Simulator (ISS) and the Design Under Test (DUT), enabling a single ISS to drive multiple DUTs in parallel. By eliminating long-tail test bottlenecks and exploiting FPGA parallelism, the simulation throughput is significantly improved. As a demonstration, we used ISAAC to verify a mature CPU that has undergone multiple successful tape-outs.

Roughly, an $(h, s)$-length $\\phi$-expander decomposition is a small collection of length increases to a graph so that nodes within distance $h$ can route flow over paths of length $hs$ while using each edge to an extent at most $1/\\phi$. Prior work showed that every $n$-node and $m$-edge graph admits an $(h, s)$-length $\\phi$-expander decomposition of size $\\log n \\cdot s n^{O(1/s)} \\cdot \\phi m$. In this work, we give a simple proof of the existence of $(h, s)$-length $\\phi$-expander decompositions with an improved size of $s n^{O(1/s)}\\cdot \\phi m$. Our proof is a straightforward application of the fact that the union of sparse length-constrained cuts is itself a sparse length-constrained cut.

Detecting these semantic-level anomalies is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment. In this paper, we formalize \\textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC images and introduce \\textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured annotations as quadruples \\emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}. Annotations are produced by a modular multi-agent pipeline (\\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality. At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\\,B GPT-4o tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations.

Godel machines offer a principled safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code; however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings. We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level, while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification in learning systems.Code is available at: https://github.com/gravitywavelet/sgm-anon.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10232","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.671121","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":178,"author":"Xuening Wu, Shenqin Yin, Yanlan Kang, Xinhang Zhang, Qianya Xu, Zeping Chen, Wenqiang Zhang","raw_content_length":1472,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending"],"persons":["Hoeffding"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1471,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SGM","A Statistical Godel Machine","Risk","Announce Type","new Abstract","Recursive self-modification","AutoML","neural architecture search","adaptive optimization","no existing framework"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["AutoML"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SGM":3.0,"A Statistical Godel Machine":2.0,"Risk":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recursive self-modification":1.0,"AutoML":1.0,"neural architecture search":1.0,"adaptive optimization":1.0,"no existing framework":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749532734166667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.982,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7964,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7159,"joy":0.0122,"surprise":0.0192,"sadness":0.0105,"fear":0.2145,"anger":0.0196,"disgust":0.0079},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel statistical safety layer (SGM) for recursive edits in machine learning systems, validated through experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and RL/optimization benchmarks.

Many studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\\_proj components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions, rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in safety-critical applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10238","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.672322","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":222,"author":"Zixuan Qin, Kunlin Lyu, Qingchen Yu, Yifan Sun, Zhaoxin Fan","raw_content_length":1599,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.11,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Causal Identification of Critical Neurons"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1598,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LLMs","The Achilles Heel","a Handful","Neurons","the human brain","a small subset","arXiv251010238v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Large Language Models","foundational tools"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLMs","Large Language Models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LLMs":5.0,"The Achilles Heel":2.0,"a Handful":2.0,"Neurons":2.0,"the human brain":2.0,"a small subset":2.0,"arXiv251010238v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Large Language Models":1.0,"foundational tools":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7495784624999997,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8765,"joy":0.0148,"surprise":0.069,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0152,"anger":0.0114,"disgust":0.0069},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research identifies critical neurons in LLMs, showing that disrupting them can cause a 72B-parameter model to collapse, increasing perplexity by up to 20 orders of magnitude.

Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose \\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method (\\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS, which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10241","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.672739","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscl","csir","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":173,"author":"Kangyang Luo, Yuzhuo Bai, Shuzheng Si, Cheng Gao, Zhitong Wang, Yingli Shen, Wenhao Li, Zhu Liu, Yufeng Han, Jiayi Wu, Cunliang Kong, Maosong Sun","raw_content_length":1354,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.865,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ImCoref-CeS","Large Language Models","An Improved Lightweight Pipeline for Coreference Resolution with LLM","NLP","LLM","Natural Language Processing"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1353,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Coreference Resolution","ImCoref-CeS","An Improved Lightweight Pipeline","LLM","arXiv251010241v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a critical task","Natural Language Processing","NLP","Current research"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM","Natural Language Processing"],"research_academic":["Current research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Coreference Resolution":3.0,"ImCoref-CeS":2.0,"An Improved Lightweight Pipeline":2.0,"LLM":2.0,"arXiv251010241v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a critical task":1.0,"Natural Language Processing":1.0,"NLP":1.0,"Current research":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7495940519444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.088000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8176,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7256,"joy":0.0225,"surprise":0.0257,"sadness":0.0255,"fear":0.1561,"anger":0.0311,"disgust":0.0135},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework for coreference resolution using LLMs. While it claims superior performance compared to existing methods, there's no mention of concrete deployment or measurable outcomes related to sustainability.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_4d84a81bf887","title":"Efficient Mining of Low","content":"arXiv:2510.10243v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Discovering valuable insights from rich data is a crucial task for exploratory data analysis. Sequential pattern mining (SPM) has found widespread applications across various domains. In recent years, low-utility sequential pattern mining (LUSPM) has shown strong potential in applications such as intrusion detection and genomic sequence analysis. However, existing research in utility-based SPM focuses on high-utility sequential patterns, and the definitions and strategies used in high-utility SPM cannot be directly applied to LUSPM. Moreover, no algorithms have yet been developed specifically for mining low-utility sequential patterns. To address these problems, we formalize the LUSPM problem, redefine sequence utility, and introduce a compact data structure called the sequence-utility chain to efficiently record utility information. Furthermore, we propose three novel algorithm--LUSPM_b, LUSPM_s, and LUSPM_e--to discover the complete set of low-utility sequential patterns. LUSPM_b serves as an exhaustive baseline, while LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e build upon it, generating subsequences through shrinkage and extension operations, respectively. In addition, we introduce the maximal non-mutually contained sequence set and incorporate multiple pruning strategies, which significantly reduce redundant operations in both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that both LUSPM_s and LUSPM_e substantially outperform LUSPM_b and exhibit excellent scalability. Notably, LUSPM_e achieves superior efficiency, requiring less runtime and memory consumption than LUSPM_s.

High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881, outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3) In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\\% for the R metric and 2\\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10244","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.673587","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":274,"author":"Ziyu Zhou, Keyan Hu, Ling Zhang, Zhaohui Xue, Yutian Fang, Yusha Zheng","raw_content_length":1953,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.37,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Progressive Scale Convolutional Network for Spatio arXiv:2510.10244v1"],"persons":["ERA5-Land"],"locations":["the Tibetan Plateau"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1952,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Progressive Scale Convolutional Network","Spatio","arXiv251010244v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Soil moisture","a critical role","hydrological and meteorological processes","High-resolution SM","coarse passive microwave data","fine-scale auxiliary variables"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Progressive Scale Convolutional Network":2.0,"Spatio":2.0,"arXiv251010244v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Soil moisture":1.0,"a critical role":1.0,"hydrological and meteorological processes":1.0,"High-resolution SM":1.0,"coarse passive microwave data":1.0,"fine-scale auxiliary variables":1.0}},"age_hours":2.749624529722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8872,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0275,"sadness":0.0196,"fear":0.0232,"anger":0.0188,"disgust":0.0149},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel deep learning model (PSCNet) for downscaling soil moisture data, which is crucial for understanding hydrological and meteorological processes.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_17a6456d4faf","title":"System Password Security: Attack and Defense Mechanisms","content":"arXiv:2510.10246v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: System passwords serve as critical credentials for user authentication and access control when logging into operating systems or applications. Upon entering a valid password, users pass verification to access system resources and execute corresponding operations. In recent years, frequent password cracking attacks targeting system passwords have posed a severe threat to information system security. To address this challenge, in-depth research into password cracking attack methods and defensive technologies holds significant importance. This paper conducts systematic research on system password security, focusing on analyzing typical password cracking methods such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and rainbow table attacks, while evaluating the effectiveness of existing defensive measures. The experimental section utilizes common cryptanalysis tools, such as John the Ripper and Hashcat, to simulate brute force and dictionary attacks. Five test datasets, each generated using Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit (SHA 256), and bcrypt hash functions, are analyzed. By comparing the overall performance of different hash algorithms and password complexity strategies against these attacks, the effectiveness of defensive measures such as salting and slow hashing algorithms is validated. Building upon this foundation, this paper further evaluates widely adopted defense mechanisms, including account lockout policies, multi-factor authentication, and risk adaptive authentication. By integrating experimental data with recent research findings, it analyzes the strengths and limitations of each approach while proposing feasible improvement recommendations and optimization strategies.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10246","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.674000","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":232,"author":"Chaofang Shi, Zhongwen Li, Xiaoqi Li","raw_content_length":1783,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.16,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["John the Ripper"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1782,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["System Password Security","Attack and Defense Mechanisms","arXiv251010246v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","System passwords","critical credentials","user authentication","access control","operating systems"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"System Password Security":2.0,"Attack and Defense Mechanisms":2.0,"arXiv251010246v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"System passwords":1.0,"critical credentials":1.0,"user authentication":1.0,"access control":1.0,"operating systems":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7496382466666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.7990000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8402,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2755,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0102,"sadness":0.0212,"fear":0.6174,"anger":0.0596,"disgust":0.011},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper analyzes password security and defensive measures.
