{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_fb7ec0e69e33","title":"The Hidden DNA of LLM","content":"arXiv:2510.10493v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale study exploring whether JavaScript code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) can reveal which model produced it, enabling reliable authorship attribution and model fingerprinting. With the rapid rise of AI-generated code, attribution is playing a critical role in detecting vulnerabilities, flagging malicious content, and ensuring accountability. While AI-vs-human detection usually treats AI as a single category we show that individual LLMs leave unique stylistic signatures, even among models belonging to the same family or parameter size. To this end, we introduce LLM-NodeJS, a dataset of 50,000 Node.js back-end programs from 20 large language models. Each has four transformed variants, yielding 250,000 unique JavaScript samples and two additional representations (JSIR and AST) for diverse research applications. Using this dataset, we benchmark traditional machine learning classifiers against fine-tuned Transformer encoders and introduce CodeT5-JSA, a custom architecture derived from the 770M-parameter CodeT5 model with its decoder removed and a modified classification head. It achieves 95.8% accuracy on five-class attribution, 94.6% on ten-class, and 88.5% on twenty-class tasks, surpassing other tested models such as BERT, CodeBERT, and Longformer. We demonstrate that classifiers capture deeper stylistic regularities in program dataflow and structure, rather than relying on surface-level features. As a result, attribution remains effective even after mangling, comment removal, and heavy code transformations. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the LLM-NodeJS dataset, Google Colab training scripts, and all related materials on GitHub: https://github.com/LLM-NodeJS-dataset.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10493","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.728645","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","preprints","cscr","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Norbert Tihanyi, Bilel Cherif, Richard A.

Identifying which reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the overall change in latent representations between the start and end of reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average. Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace, enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10494","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.729044","language":"en","tags":["preprints","csai","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":207,"author":"Martina G.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c1342cd74a0c","title":"Personalized Motion Guidance Framework for Athlete","content":"arXiv:2510.10496v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A critical challenge in contemporary sports science lies in filling the gap between group-level insights derived from controlled hypothesis-driven experiments and the real-world need for personalized coaching tailored to individual athletes' unique movement patterns. This study developed a Personalized Motion Guidance Framework (PMGF) to enhance athletic performance by generating individualized motion-refinement guides using generative artificial intelligence techniques. PMGF leverages a vertical autoencoder to encode motion sequences into athlete-specific latent representations, which can then be directly manipulated to generate meaningful guidance motions. Two manipulation strategies were explored: (1) smooth interpolation between the learner's motion and a target (e.g., expert) motion to facilitate observational learning, and (2) shifting the motion pattern in an optimal direction in the latent space using a local optimization technique. The results of the validation experiment with data from 51 baseball pitchers revealed that (1) PMGF successfully generated smooth transitions in motion patterns between individuals across all 1,275 pitcher pairs, and (2) the features significantly altered through PMGF manipulations reflected known performance-enhancing characteristics, such as increased stride length and knee extension associated with higher ball velocity, indicating that PMGF induces biomechanically plausible improvements. We propose a future extension called general-PMGF to enhance the applicability of this framework. This extension incorporates bodily, environmental, and task constraints into the generation process, aiming to provide more realistic and versatile guidance across diverse sports contexts.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10496","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.729459","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cshc","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":228,"author":"Ryota Takamidoa, Chiharu Suzukia, Hiroki Nakamoto","raw_content_length":1786,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.14,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1785,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Personalized Motion Guidance Framework","Athlete","arXiv251010496v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","A critical challenge","contemporary sports science","the gap","group-level insights","controlled hypothesis-driven experiments","the real-world need"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["contemporary sports science"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Personalized Motion Guidance Framework":2.0,"Athlete":2.0,"arXiv251010496v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"A critical challenge":1.0,"contemporary sports science":1.0,"the gap":1.0,"group-level insights":1.0,"controlled hypothesis-driven experiments":1.0,"the real-world need":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751660086111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.0705,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5859,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8699,"joy":0.0253,"surprise":0.0721,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0097,"anger":0.013,"disgust":0.0038},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research focuses on developing a personalized motion guidance framework using AI.

The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention, producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh. The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures. Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

This study introduces a multi-step network pruning framework that leverages principles from information theory to balance structural complexity and task-relevant information. The framework iteratively evaluates and removes edges from the graph based on their contribution to task-relevant mutual information, producing a trajectory of network simplification that preserves most of the inherent semantics. Motivated by gradient boosting, we propose IGPrune, which enables efficient, differentiable optimization to progressively uncover semantically meaningful connections.

In current systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners. Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by (i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under < 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10506","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.731606","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":202,"author":"Kush Garg (Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India), Akshat Dave (Stony Brook University, NY, United States)","raw_content_length":1554,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.01,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NLOS","Non-Line arXiv:2510.10506v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1553,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Indoor Mapping","Exploration","Non","Line","sight","arXiv251010506v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Efficient exploration","mapping","unknown indoor environments"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Indoor Mapping":2.0,"Exploration":2.0,"Non":2.0,"Line":2.0,"sight":2.0,"arXiv251010506v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Efficient exploration":1.0,"mapping":1.0,"unknown indoor environments":1.0}},"age_hours":2.751737818055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8346,"joy":0.0122,"surprise":0.0372,"sadness":0.01,"fear":0.0246,"anger":0.0593,"disgust":0.022},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method (SuperEx) for indoor mapping using non-line-of-sight LiDAR technology.

In real-world platforms, the creation behaviors of content creators plays a crucial role in shaping long-term welfare beyond short-term recommendation accuracy, making the effective steering of creator behavior essential to foster a healthier RS ecosystem. Existing works typically rely on re-ranking algorithms that heuristically adjust item exposure to steer creators' behavior. However, when embedded within recommendation pipelines, such a strategy often conflicts with the short-term objective of improving recommendation accuracy, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal long-term welfare. The well-established economics studies offer us valuable insights for an alternative approach without relying on recommendation algorithmic design: revealing information from an information-rich party (sender) to a less-informed party (receiver) can effectively change the receiver's beliefs and steer their behavior. Inspired by this idea, we propose an information-revealing framework, named Long-term Welfare Optimization via Information Revelation (LoRe). In this framework, we utilize a classical information revelation method (i.e., Bayesian persuasion) to map the stakeholders in RS, treating the platform as the sender and creators as the receivers. To address the challenge posed by the unrealistic assumption of traditional economic methods, we formulate the process of information revelation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a learning algorithm trained and inferred in environments with boundedly rational creators. Extensive experiments on two real-world RS datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively outperform existing fair re-ranking methods and information revealing strategies in improving long-term user welfare.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10511","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.732839","language":"en","tags":["csir","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Xu Zhao, Xiaopeng Ye, Chen Xu, Weiran Shen, Jun Xu","raw_content_length":1941,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.275,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1940,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Long","Announce Type","new Abstract","the long-term user welfare","eg sustained user engagement","a central objective","recommender systems","real-world platforms","the creation behaviors","content creators"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["eg sustained user engagement"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Long":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the long-term user welfare":1.0,"eg sustained user engagement":1.0,"a central objective":1.0,"recommender systems":1.0,"real-world platforms":1.0,"the creation behaviors":1.0,"content creators":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7517826791666664,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":9.5005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9001,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.912,"joy":0.0486,"surprise":0.0226,"sadness":0.004,"fear":0.003,"anger":0.0058,"disgust":0.0041},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article proposes a new information-revealing framework (LoRe) to improve long-term user welfare in recommender systems, potentially leading to a healthier RS ecosystem.

These limitations impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods: noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around 0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%, confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable to models trained on real data.

This paper introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and control performance.

We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during pick-and-place operations.

Recent approaches employ code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code, ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt, providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic, require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to 7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10517","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.734098","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","cspl","preprints","csse","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":189,"author":"Su-Hyeon Kim, Joonghyuk Hahn, Sooyoung Cha, Yo-Sub Han","raw_content_length":1381,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.945,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1380,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ECO","Enhanced Code Optimization","Performance","arXiv251010517v1","Announce Type","new Abstract","Code runtime optimization","the task","a given code","reasoning"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ECO":2.0,"Enhanced Code Optimization":2.0,"Performance":2.0,"arXiv251010517v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Code runtime optimization":1.0,"the task":1.0,"a given code":1.0,"reasoning":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7518277933333337,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8906,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0361,"sadness":0.0222,"fear":0.0072,"anger":0.0238,"disgust":0.0152},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a new code optimization framework (ECO) that leverages code-LLMs to generate more efficient code, resulting in speedups of up to 7.81x.

However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal, various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing LUT methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10522","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.735350","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":194,"author":"Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu","raw_content_length":1395,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.97,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LUT","CNN"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1394,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Receptive Field Expanded Look-Up Tables","Vision Inference","Low","Announce Type","new Abstract","several look-up table LUT methods","the inference","CNNs","a classical strategy","trading space"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Receptive Field Expanded Look-Up Tables":2.0,"Vision Inference":2.0,"Low":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"several look-up table LUT methods":1.0,"the inference":1.0,"CNNs":1.0,"a classical strategy":1.0,"trading space":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7518720500000002,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.5305,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4939,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8953,"joy":0.0191,"surprise":0.0131,"sadness":0.011,"fear":0.0213,"anger":0.0214,"disgust":0.0188},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research proposes a novel approach to improve the inference speed of CNNs, which could indirectly reduce energy consumption of computing infrastructure.

However, such a lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance.

However, selecting intermediate domains without explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features. This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional CDA approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10530","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.736597","language":"en","tags":["research","cslg","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":171,"author":"Hanbing Liu, Huaze Tang, Yanru Wu, Yang Li, Xiao-Ping Zhang","raw_content_length":1370,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.855,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["CDA"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1369,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Continuous Domain Adaptation","Reinforced Domain Selection","intermediate domains","Announce Type","new Abstract","CDA","significant domain shifts","the source domain","the target domain","explicit metadata"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Continuous Domain Adaptation"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Continuous Domain Adaptation":3.0,"Reinforced Domain Selection":2.0,"intermediate domains":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"CDA":1.0,"significant domain shifts":1.0,"the source domain":1.0,"the target domain":1.0,"explicit metadata":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7519151122222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.982,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7964,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9155,"joy":0.0107,"surprise":0.0376,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.011,"anger":0.0152,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel framework for continuous domain adaptation using reinforcement learning.

This enables low-latency high-throughput networking, as required for many modern data centres, HPC applications and AI/ML workloads. However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly permissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only recently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable Objects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on RDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming. LOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality and the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA. They have performance comparable to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a far simpler programming model amenable to formal proofs of correctness. To support verification, we develop a novel modular declarative verification framework, called Mowgli, that is flexible enough to model multinode objects and is independent of a memory consistency model. We instantiate Mowgli with the RDMA memory model, and use it to verify correctness of LOCO libraries.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10531","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.737012","language":"en","tags":["eesssy","cspl","cssy","preprints","csdc","research","cslo","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":196,"author":"Guillaume Ambal, George Hodgkins, Mark Madler, Gregory Chockler, Brijesh Dongol, Joseph Izraelevitz, Azalea Raad, Viktor Vafeiadis","raw_content_length":1338,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.98,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Library of Composable Objects","AI/ML","CPU","HPC","LOCO","Remote Direct Memory Access"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1337,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Verified High","arXiv251010531v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Remote Direct Memory Access","RDMA","a memory technology","remote devices","each others memory","bypassing components","the CPU and operating system"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Verified High":2.0,"arXiv251010531v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Remote Direct Memory Access":1.0,"RDMA":1.0,"a memory technology":1.0,"remote devices":1.0,"each others memory":1.0,"bypassing components":1.0,"the CPU and operating system":1.0}},"age_hours":2.75193023,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.465,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.507,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9251,"joy":0.012,"surprise":0.0326,"sadness":0.0064,"fear":0.01,"anger":0.0077,"disgust":0.0061},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a formally verified library (LOCO) for building multi-node objects on RDMA, which can improve the efficiency of data centers and HPC applications.

However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations.

Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage. To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues, thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in 31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise, their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10539","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.738265","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Yujie Ren, Niklas Gruhlke, Anne Lauscher","raw_content_length":1334,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","AuthenHallu"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1333,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Detecting Hallucinations","Authentic LLM","arXiv251010539v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","large language models","LLMs","sensitive domains","medicine","law","hallucination detection"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Authentic LLM","large language models"],"healthcare_tech":["medicine"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Detecting Hallucinations":2.0,"Authentic LLM":2.0,"arXiv251010539v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"large language models":1.0,"LLMs":1.0,"sensitive domains":1.0,"medicine":1.0,"law":1.0,"hallucination detection":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7519730358333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7731,"joy":0.0045,"surprise":0.0292,"sadness":0.0256,"fear":0.0193,"anger":0.0482,"disgust":0.1002},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a new benchmark (AuthenHallu) for detecting hallucinations in LLMs based on real-world human-LLM interactions.

This question was highlighted as 'Q8' in the Kyber NIST standardization submission (Avanzi et al., 2021), as potentially affecting the concrete security of Kyber and other module-lattice-based schemes. Foundational works on module-lattice reduction (Lee, Pellet-Mary, Stehl\\'e, and Wallet, ASIACRYPT 2019; Mukherjee and Stephens-Davidowitz, CRYPTO 2020) confirmed the existence of such module variants of LLL and block-reduction algorithms, but focus only on provable worst-case asymptotic behavior. In this work, we present a concrete average-case analysis of module-lattice reduction. Specifically, we address the question of the expected slope after running module-BKZ, and pinpoint the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ of the number field at hand as the main quantity driving this slope. We convert this back into a gain or loss on the blocksize $\\beta$: module-BKZ in a number field $K$ of degree $d$ requires an SVP oracle of dimension $\\beta + \\log(|\\Delta_K| / d^d)\\beta /(d\\log \\beta) + o(\\beta / \\log \\beta)$ to reach the same slope as unstructured BKZ with blocksize $\\beta$. This asymptotic summary hides further terms that we predict concretely using experimentally verified heuristics. Incidentally, we provide the first open-source implementation of module-BKZ for some cyclotomic fields. For power-of-two cyclotomic fields, we have $|\\Delta_K| = d^d$, and conclude that module-BKZ requires a blocksize larger than its unstructured counterpart by $d-1+o(1)$. On the contrary, for all other cyclotomic fields we have $|\\Delta_K| < d^d$, so module-BKZ provides a sublinear $\\Theta(\\beta/\\log \\beta)$ gain on the required blocksize, yielding a subexponential speedup of $\\exp(\\Theta(\\beta/\\log \\beta))$.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10540","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.738718","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":253,"author":"L\\'eo Ducas, Lynn Engelberts, Paola de Perthuis","raw_content_length":1831,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.265,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Avanzi","Predicting Module","LLL","Stephens-Davidowitz"],"persons":["Wallet","Lee","Announce Type"],"locations":["Kyber"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1826,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Module","module-lattice reduction","arXiv251010540v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","unstructured lattice reduction","This question","the Kyber NIST standardization submission","Avanzi","the concrete security","Kyber"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Module":2.0,"module-lattice reduction":2.0,"arXiv251010540v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"unstructured lattice reduction":1.0,"This question":1.0,"the Kyber NIST standardization submission":1.0,"Avanzi":1.0,"the concrete security":1.0,"Kyber":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7519892075000003,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.243,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6486,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8506,"joy":0.0133,"surprise":0.0523,"sadness":0.0114,"fear":0.0451,"anger":0.0208,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical analysis and open-source implementation of module-BKZ, a lattice reduction algorithm used in cryptography.

We further analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10541","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.739112","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cslg","csai","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Zihan Chen, Yiming Zhang, Hengguang Zhou, Zenghui Ding, Yining Sun, Cho-Jui Hsieh","raw_content_length":1159,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["OPG"],"persons":["RL Methods","Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1158,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["RL Evaluation","Benchmarks","Failures","RL Methods","arXiv251010541v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Current benchmarks","progress","reinforcement learning","large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Failures","reinforcement learning","large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"RL Evaluation":2.0,"Benchmarks":2.0,"Failures":2.0,"RL Methods":2.0,"arXiv251010541v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Current benchmarks":1.0,"progress":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752004053888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3629,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.0163,"sadness":0.0325,"fear":0.406,"anger":0.0986,"disgust":0.0785},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article identifies a problem with current RL benchmarks for LLMs, showing that training on test sets achieves similar results as training on training sets.

We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram.

Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available to support future research in glacial hazard prediction.

Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI) research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due to overthinking or noisy retrieval.

However, these AI-assisted workflows can also significantly alter the developer's role, raising concerns about control, output quality, and learning, particularly for novice developers. This study investigates how novice software developers with foundational knowledge in software testing interact with generative AI for engineering unit tests. Our goal is to examine the strategies they use, how heavily they rely on generative AI, and the benefits and challenges they perceive when using generative AI-assisted approaches for test engineering. We conducted an observational study involving 12 undergraduate students who worked with generative AI for unit testing tasks. We identified four interaction strategies, defined by whether the test idea or the test implementation originated from generative AI or the participant. Additionally, we singled out prompting styles that focused on one-shot or iterative test generation, which often aligned with the broader interaction strategy. Students reported benefits including time-saving, reduced cognitive load, and support for test ideation, but also noted drawbacks such as diminished trust, test quality concerns, and lack of ownership. While strategy and prompting styles influenced workflow dynamics, they did not significantly affect test effectiveness or test code quality as measured by mutation score or test smells.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10551","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.741099","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Baris Ardic, Quentin Le Dilavrec, Andy Zaidman","raw_content_length":1598,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["An Observational Study arXiv:2510.10551v1 Announce Type: new"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1597,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Students","Generative AI","Software Testing","Announce Type","new Abstract","The integration","generative AI tools","ChatGPT","software engineering workflows","new opportunities"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Generative AI","ChatGPT"],"engineering":["software engineering workflows"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Students":2.0,"Generative AI":2.0,"Software Testing":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The integration":1.0,"generative AI tools":1.0,"ChatGPT":1.0,"software engineering workflows":1.0,"new opportunities":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7520754369444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.8915,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7783,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5156,"joy":0.0086,"surprise":0.011,"sadness":0.0094,"fear":0.364,"anger":0.0502,"disgust":0.0412},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This study examines the use of generative AI in software testing by novice developers.

The researchers found out that the electrical infrastructure of the Gym was outdated, and the lighting was not energy efficient, and there were too few convenience or power outlets. There was also insufficient cooling equipment to maintain a comfortable temperature. Analysis shows that the payback period is within the average range, making it a cost-effective investment for the University. Aside from the cost of the PV System, adherence to engineering design standards will mean additional costs to replace the metal halides with LED high bay lamps, installation of additional air conditioning units, and provision of additional convenience outlets. These additional costs should be considered when evaluating the feasibility of the project. It is recommended that the integrity of the existing roof system of the Gymnasium be considered. The total cost of putting up the whole electrical system, including new lighting, cooling, and convenience loads, must be calculated to determine the total cost of implementing the whole NZEB project.

Memory-augmented architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off, delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency with a small model footprint.

However, their behavior is often governed by a cost function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning for broader autonomous driving applications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10567","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.743992","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","computer-science","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Alexander Langmann, Yevhenii Tokarev, Mattia Piccinini, Korbinian Moller, Johannes Betz","raw_content_length":1384,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["a Reinforcement Learning","Reinforcement Learning arXiv:2510.10567v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1383,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Reinforcement Learning","arXiv251010567v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Sampling-based trajectory planners","agile autonomous driving","their ability","fast smooth and kinodynamically feasible trajectories","their behavior","a cost function","manually tuned static weights"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Reinforcement Learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Reinforcement Learning":2.0,"arXiv251010567v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Sampling-based trajectory planners":1.0,"agile autonomous driving":1.0,"their ability":1.0,"fast smooth and kinodynamically feasible trajectories":1.0,"their behavior":1.0,"a cost function":1.0,"manually tuned static weights":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7521800533333334,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.591,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3182,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9392,"joy":0.0046,"surprise":0.0267,"sadness":0.007,"fear":0.0085,"anger":0.0089,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":4,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a novel approach to autonomous driving using reinforcement learning to optimize trajectory planning.

The sizes of the storage nodes, and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10568","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.744380","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","quant-ph","preprints","mathit","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":186,"author":"Hua Sun, Syed A.

As a result, in recent years, there has been growing interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a way consistent with their individual data distributions.

To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7 widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks, but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without guidance), respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10575","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.746336","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Zhengrong Yue, Haiyu Zhang, Xiangyu Zeng, Boyu Chen, Chenting Wang, Shaobin Zhuang, Lu Dong, KunPeng Du, Yi Wang, Limin Wang, Yali Wang","raw_content_length":1880,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.225,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["UniFlow"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1879,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["UniFlow","A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer","Visual Understanding","Generation","generation","arXiv251010575v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Tokenizer","a crucial component","both visual understanding"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"UniFlow":2.0,"A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer":2.0,"Visual Understanding":2.0,"Generation":2.0,"generation":2.0,"arXiv251010575v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Tokenizer":1.0,"a crucial component":1.0,"both visual understanding":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7522654930555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.715,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.743,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8819,"joy":0.0114,"surprise":0.0247,"sadness":0.0102,"fear":0.0428,"anger":0.02,"disgust":0.0089},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel tokenizer (UniFlow) for visual understanding and generation, demonstrating improved performance on several benchmarks.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_7c3785fa78ad","title":"Injecting Frame","content":"arXiv:2510.10577v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which is not affected by the deteriorated visual features.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_39e1d38f69ea","title":"AQORA: A Learned Adaptive Query Optimizer for Spark SQL","content":"arXiv:2510.10580v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent studies have identified two main approaches to improve query optimization: learned query optimization (LQO), which generates or selects better query plans before execution based on models trained in advance, and adaptive query processing (AQP), which adapts the query plan during execution based on statistical feedback collected at runtime. Although both approaches have shown promise, they also face critical limitations. LQO must commit to a fixed plan without access to actual cardinalities and typically rely on a single end-to-end feedback signal, making learning inefficient. On the other hand, AQP depends heavily on rule-based heuristics and lacks the ability to learn from experience. In this paper, we present AQORA, an adaptive query optimizer with a reinforcement learning architecture that combines the strengths of both LQO and AQP. AQORA addresses the above challenges through four core strategies: (1) realistic feature encoding, (2) query stage-level feedback and intervention, (3) automatic strategy adaptation, and (4) low-cost integration. Experiments show that AQORA reduces end-to-end execution time by up to 90% compared to other learned methods and by up to 70% compared to Spark SQL's default configuration with adaptive query execution.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10580","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.747133","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","research","csdb","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Jiahao He, Yutao Cui, Cuiping Li, Jikang Jiang, Yuheng Hou, Hong Chen","raw_content_length":1319,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AQP","LQO"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1318,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["AQORA","A Learned Adaptive Query Optimizer","Spark SQL","query optimization","LQO","which","execution","Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent studies"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"AQORA":2.0,"A Learned Adaptive Query Optimizer":2.0,"Spark SQL":2.0,"query optimization":2.0,"LQO":2.0,"which":2.0,"execution":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent studies":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7522953288888887,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.701500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9403,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8999,"joy":0.0228,"surprise":0.0479,"sadness":0.0057,"fear":0.005,"anger":0.0131,"disgust":0.0055},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel adaptive query optimizer (AQORA) that reduces end-to-end execution time, leading to potential energy savings in data processing.

Existing temporal attribution methods struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for information dependencies that span agents.

To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{GraphTracer}, a framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis. GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios.

Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this, we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\\beta$ Mixup strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution. This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories, improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming baseline methods.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10584","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.748108","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":214,"author":"Shizhen Zhao, Jiahui Liu, Xin Wen, Haoru Tan, Xiaojuan Qi","raw_content_length":1660,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.07,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["vision foundation"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1659,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Vision Foundation Model","Mixture","Experts","arXiv251010584v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Pre-trained vision foundation models","many computer vision tasks","their strong ability","discriminative and generalizable features","distribution"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Pre-trained vision foundation models","many computer vision tasks"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Vision Foundation Model":2.0,"Mixture":2.0,"Experts":2.0,"arXiv251010584v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Pre-trained vision foundation models":1.0,"many computer vision tasks":1.0,"their strong ability":1.0,"discriminative and generalizable features":1.0,"distribution":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752325799722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.263,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.6526,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7789,"joy":0.0075,"surprise":0.0153,"sadness":0.0069,"fear":0.1121,"anger":0.0475,"disgust":0.0318},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article describes a novel approach to improving out-of-distribution detection using vision foundation models.

We propose a framework where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as \\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local) actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \\emph{structural constraints} -- equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii) \\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher layers receive only \\emph{coarse-grained residual transformations} (prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower layers.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10586","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.748968","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","preprints","research","q-bionc","mathit","csit","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Giulio Ruffini","raw_content_length":1502,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Compositional Symmetry as Compression"],"persons":["Kolmogorov","Solomonoff","Lie"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1501,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Compositional Symmetry","Compression","Lie Pseudogroup Structure","Algorithmic Agents","Announce Type","new Abstract","the algorithmic Kolmogorov view","agents","programs","sensory streams"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Algorithmic Agents","the algorithmic Kolmogorov view"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Compositional Symmetry":2.0,"Compression":2.0,"Lie Pseudogroup Structure":2.0,"Algorithmic Agents":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"the algorithmic Kolmogorov view":1.0,"agents":1.0,"programs":1.0,"sensory streams":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7523557152777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.786999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5574,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8585,"joy":0.0308,"surprise":0.0539,"sadness":0.0061,"fear":0.0102,"anger":0.0243,"disgust":0.0161},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a theoretical framework for algorithmic agents using compositional symmetry.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ff8894df80d6","title":"A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding","content":"arXiv:2510.10587v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities, there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration, linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding, called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective visual features.

To address the problem of ineffective implementation of AI ethics, we present our diagnosis, analysis, and interventional recommendations from a unique perspective of the real-world implementation of AI ethics through explainable AI (XAI) techniques. We first describe the phenomenon (i.e., the \"symptoms\") of ineffective implementation of AI ethics in explainable AI using four empirical cases. From the \"symptoms\", we diagnose the root cause (i.e., the \"disease\") being the dysfunction and imbalance of power structures in the sociotechnical system of AI. The power structures are dominated by unjust and unchecked power that does not represent the benefits and interests of the public and the most impacted communities, and cannot be countervailed by ethical power. Based on the understanding of power mechanisms, we propose three interventional recommendations to tackle the root cause, including: 1) Making power explicable and checked, 2) Reframing the narratives and assumptions of AI and AI ethics to check unjust power and reflect the values and benefits of the public, and 3) Uniting the efforts of ethical and scientific conduct of AI to encode ethical values as technical standards, norms, and methods, including conducting critical examinations and limitation analyses of AI technical practices. We hope that our diagnosis and interventional recommendations can be a useful input to the AI community and civil society's ongoing discussion and implementation of ethics in AI for ethical and responsible AI practice.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10588","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.749828","language":"en","tags":["cscy","research","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Weina Jin, Elise Li Zheng, Ghassan Hamarneh","raw_content_length":1702,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Redirecting Power to Operationalize Ethics","AI Technical Practice arXiv:2510.10588v1 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1701,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Power","Understanding","Redirecting Power","Ethics","AI Technical Practice","AI ethics","arXiv251010588v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The operationalization","ethics"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["Power"],"ai_ml":["AI Technical Practice"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Power":2.0,"Understanding":2.0,"Redirecting Power":2.0,"Ethics":2.0,"AI Technical Practice":2.0,"AI ethics":2.0,"arXiv251010588v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The operationalization":1.0,"ethics":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752385636388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8275,"joy":0.0126,"surprise":0.0208,"sadness":0.0134,"fear":0.0609,"anger":0.0383,"disgust":0.0264},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":6,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article proposes a framework for making AI ethics more operational through explainable AI (XAI).

Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically. In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions, which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs in real-world problem-solving.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10592","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.750235","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":187,"author":"Hong Su","raw_content_length":1461,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.935,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope Extension"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1460,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Layered Intuition","arXiv251010592v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Existing studies","method-based reasoning and scope extension","approaches","LLM","direct matrix mappings","these foundations","these ideas"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["LLM"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Layered Intuition":2.0,"arXiv251010592v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Existing studies":1.0,"method-based reasoning and scope extension":1.0,"approaches":1.0,"LLM":1.0,"direct matrix mappings":1.0,"these foundations":1.0,"these ideas":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7524001761111108,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8525,"joy":0.0492,"surprise":0.0559,"sadness":0.0075,"fear":0.0087,"anger":0.0204,"disgust":0.0058},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to LLM reasoning, but it is currently in the theoretical stage.

Measuring the distance between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory (RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10596","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.750682","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","mathit","csit","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":230,"author":"Ruolan Cheng, Yong Deng, Seraf\\'in Moral, Jos\\'e Ram\\'on Trillo","raw_content_length":1615,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.15,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["RPS","Jaccard","TBM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1614,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Distance Measure","Random Permutation Set","the Layer","RPS","arXiv251010596v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Random permutation","a recently proposed framework","order-structured uncertain information","the distance"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["order-structured uncertain information"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Distance Measure":2.0,"Random Permutation Set":2.0,"the Layer":2.0,"RPS":2.0,"arXiv251010596v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Random permutation":1.0,"a recently proposed framework":1.0,"order-structured uncertain information":1.0,"the distance":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752415726388889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.5199999999999996,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.296,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7999,"joy":0.0608,"surprise":0.0481,"sadness":0.0067,"fear":0.0646,"anger":0.0135,"disgust":0.0065},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a new distance measure for random permutation sets, which could potentially be used in various applications, including those related to sustainability.

This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses. Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10602","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.751463","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","research","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Zhuoheng Gao, Jiyao Zhang, Zhiyong Xie, Hao Dong, Zhaofei Yu, Rongmei Chen, Guozhang Chen, Tiejun Huang","raw_content_length":1192,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.79,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SpikeGrasp"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1191,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["SpikeGrasp","A Benchmark","arXiv251010602v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Most robotic grasping systems","sensor data","explicit 3D point clouds","which","a computational step","biological intelligence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"SpikeGrasp":3.0,"A Benchmark":2.0,"arXiv251010602v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Most robotic grasping systems":1.0,"sensor data":1.0,"explicit 3D point clouds":1.0,"which":1.0,"a computational step":1.0,"biological intelligence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7524452758333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.383500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4767,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8865,"joy":0.0152,"surprise":0.0662,"sadness":0.0036,"fear":0.0095,"anger":0.0119,"disgust":0.0071},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel approach to robotic grasping using spiking neural networks, potentially reducing computational energy consumption compared to traditional methods.

SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge, whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the model's internal knowledge base.

The core of ViSurf involves injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_dbdcd3bf2bba","title":"OmniQuality","content":"arXiv:2510.10609v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training, using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10609","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.753434","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cscv","research","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":175,"author":"Yiting Lu, Fengbin Guan, Yixin Gao, Yan Zhong, Xinge Peng, Jiakang Yuan, Yihao Liu, Bo Zhang, Xin Li, Zhibo Chen, Weisi Lin","raw_content_length":1436,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.875,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["SFT","OmniQuality","CoT","GRPO"],"persons":["arXiv:2510.10609v1 Announce Type"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1435,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["OmniQuality","arXiv251010609v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Current visual evaluation approaches","a single task","OmniQuality-R","a unified reward modeling framework","multi-task quality reasoning","continuous and interpretable reward signals","policy optimization"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"OmniQuality":2.0,"arXiv251010609v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Current visual evaluation approaches":1.0,"a single task":1.0,"OmniQuality-R":1.0,"a unified reward modeling framework":1.0,"multi-task quality reasoning":1.0,"continuous and interpretable reward signals":1.0,"policy optimization":1.0}},"age_hours":2.752517583888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.685500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9371,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8782,"joy":0.0322,"surprise":0.044,"sadness":0.0046,"fear":0.0093,"anger":0.0187,"disgust":0.0129},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel AI framework (OmniQuality-R) for improving visual evaluation across multiple tasks.

However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i) \\textit{Ineffective group collaboration modeling}, as they rely on pairwise edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) \\textit{Limited task-adaptiveness in communication topology design}, leading to excessive communication cost for simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{HyperAgent}, a hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiority of HyperAgent in both performance and efficiency. For instance, on GSM8K, HyperAgent achieves 95.07\\% accuracy while reducing token consumption by 25.33\\%, demonstrating the potential of hypergraph-based optimization for multi-agent communication.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10611","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.753866","language":"en","tags":["csma","preprints","research","csgr","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":190,"author":"Heng Zhang, Yuling Shi, Xiaodong Gu, Zijian Zhang, Haochen You, Lubin Gan, Yilei Yuan, Jin Huang","raw_content_length":1635,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.95,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Leveraging Hypergraphs"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1634,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["HyperAgent","Hypergraphs","Topology Optimization","Multi","arXiv251010611v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Recent advances","large language model-powered multi-agent systems","remarkable collective intelligence","effective communication"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["large language model-powered multi-agent systems"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"HyperAgent":2.0,"Hypergraphs":2.0,"Topology Optimization":2.0,"Multi":2.0,"arXiv251010611v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"large language model-powered multi-agent systems":1.0,"remarkable collective intelligence":1.0,"effective communication":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7525318505555556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.662500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9325,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4829,"joy":0.025,"surprise":0.0596,"sadness":0.0363,"fear":0.2575,"anger":0.0829,"disgust":0.0558},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":5,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel approach to multi-agent communication using hypergraphs, showing a 25.33% reduction in token consumption on the GSM8K dataset.

The method first uses a large language model to obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10613","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:38.754270","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","csai","preprints","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":193,"author":"Di Wu abd Shuaidong Pan","raw_content_length":1401,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.965,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1400,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Dynamic Topic Evolution","Temporal Decay","Attention","Large Language Models","arXiv251010613v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This paper","a modeling framework","dynamic topic evolution","temporal large language models"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Large Language Models","temporal large language models"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Dynamic Topic Evolution":2.0,"Temporal Decay":2.0,"Attention":2.0,"Large Language Models":2.0,"arXiv251010613v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a modeling framework":1.0,"dynamic topic evolution":1.0,"temporal large language models":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7525462888888885,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":7.4695,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4939,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8861,"joy":0.0228,"surprise":0.0549,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.007,"anger":0.0154,"disgust":0.0088},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for dynamic topic evolution using large language models.
