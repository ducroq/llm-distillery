In this work, we investigate the physical origin of the asymmetric response observed in broad absorption line (BAL) systems and constrain the gas density and spatial scale of quasar outflows. Using time-dependent photoionization simulations and analytical estimates focused on CIV, we quantify the response timescales across different ionization states. Our results show that over 70\\% of BAL gas exhibits a negative response to quasar dimming, indicating a strong asymmetry in ionization behavior. This asymmetry is driven by systematically shorter response timescales in higher ionization states. Given typical observational cadences longer than one day, the observed response pattern requires at least 40% of the BAL gas to have a density below $n_{\\rm H} = 10^6\\ \\cc$, consistent with most measured BAL densities but significantly lower than typical accretion disk winds ($n_{\\rm H} > 10^8\\ \\cc$). These findings suggest that BAL outflows either undergo substantial density evolution as they propagate or originate from larger-scale regions such as the dusty torus. The asymmetric response thus provides new constraints on the physical structure and origin of quasar outflows.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16463","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:13.005095","language":"en","tags":["research","physics","astro-phga","preprints","physicsplasm-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Zhicheng He, Tinggui Wang","raw_content_length":1449,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.05,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Response of Photoionization Gas arXiv:2311.16463v2 Announce Type","CIV","BAL"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1448,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Discovery","the Asymmetric Effect","the Response","Photoionization Gas","arXiv231116463v2","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","The variability","quasar radiation","a powerful probe"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["Discovery"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Discovery":2.0,"the Asymmetric Effect":2.0,"the Response":2.0,"Photoionization Gas":2.0,"arXiv231116463v2":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"The variability":1.0,"quasar radiation":1.0,"a powerful probe":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7772541855555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.929500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5859,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7691,"joy":0.0204,"surprise":0.1127,"sadness":0.0073,"fear":0.034,"anger":0.0369,"disgust":0.0196},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research investigates the physical origin of asymmetric response in broad absorption line (BAL) systems, providing constraints on the physical structure and origin of quasar outflows.

It was conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that for every connected graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $( \\frac{\\Delta-1}{\\Delta} )n +c$. We provide significant support for this conjecture by exactly characterizing every tree requiring a positive constant $c$ together with the exact value of the constant. Hence, proving the conjecture for trees. For $\\Delta=2$ (the graph is a path or a cycle), it is long known that $c=3/2$ suffices. For trees, for each $\\Delta\\ge 3$, we show that $c=1/\\Delta\\le 1/3$ suffices and that $c$ is required to have a positive value only for a finite number of trees. In particular, for $\\Delta = 3$, there are 12 trees with a positive constant $c$ and, for each $\\Delta \\ge 4$, the only tree with positive constant $c$ is the $\\Delta$-star. Our proof is based on induction and utilizes recent results from [F. Foucaud, T. Lehtil\\\"a. Revisiting and improving upper bounds for identifying codes. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2022]. We remark that there are infinitely many trees for which the bound is tight when $\\Delta=3$; for every $\\Delta\\ge 4$, we construct an infinite family of trees of order $n$ with identification number very close to the bound, namely $\\left( \\frac{\\Delta-1+\\frac{1}{\\Delta-2}}{\\Delta+\\frac{2}{\\Delta-2}} \\right) n > (\\frac{\\Delta-1}{\\Delta} ) n -\\frac{n}{\\Delta^2}$. Furthermore, we also give a new tight upper bound for identification number on trees by showing that the sum of the domination and identification numbers of any tree $T$ is at most its number of vertices.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13172","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.972968","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathco","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":299,"author":"Dipayan Chakraborty, Florent Foucaud, Michael A.

The aim of this manuscript is to determine the location of right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ relative to certain subsets of the set of quaternions. In particular, we extend the notion of (hyper)stability of complex matrix polynomials to quaternion matrix polynomials and obtain location of right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ using the following methods: $(1)$ we give a relation between (hyper)stability of a quaternion matrix polynomial and its complex adjoint matrix polynomial, $(2)$ we prove that $P(\\lambda)$ is stable with respect to an open (closed) ball in the set of quaternions, centered at a complex number if and only if it is stable with respect to its intersection with the set of complex numbers and $(3)$ as a consequence of $(1)$ and $(2)$, we prove that right eigenvalues of $P(\\lambda)$ lie between two concentric balls of specific radii in the set of quaternions centered at the origin. A generalization of the Enestr{\\\"o}m-Kakeya theorem to quaternion matrix polynomials is obtained as an application.

It is known that a graph $G$ is not $(k, \\epsilon)$-flexible for any $k$ if and only if $\\epsilon > 1/ \\rho(G)$ where $\\rho(G)$ is the Hall ratio of $G$. The list flexibility number of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi_{\\ell flex}(G)$, is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ is $(k,1/ \\rho(G))$-flexible. A fundamental open question on list flexibility numbers asks: Is there a graph with list flexibility number greater than its coloring number? In this paper, we show that the list flexibility number of any complete multipartite graph $G$ is at most the coloring number of $G$. We also initiate the study of list epsilon flexibility functions of complete bipartite graphs which was first suggested by Kaul, Mathew, Mudrock, and Pelsmajer in 2024. Specifically, we completely determine the list epsilon flexibility function of $K_{m,n}$ when $m \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and establish some additional bounds for small $m$. Our proofs reveal a connection to list coloring complete bipartite graphs with asymmetric list sizes which is a topic that was explored by Alon, Cambie, and Kang in 2021.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15927","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.983896","language":"en","tags":["mathematics","mathco","preprints","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":266,"author":"Timothy Bennett, Michael C.

This study presents a comprehensive optimization framework that jointly addresses the design and control of a nonlinear energy system supplying both heat and electricity to the Dietenbach district in Freiburg, Germany. The proposed system integrates solar and wind power with battery storage and seasonal thermal energy storage coupled via a heat pump, enhancing self-sufficiency and mitigating seasonal supply-demand mismatches. A multi-node lumped-parameter model captures heat transfer within the pit thermal energy storage, forming the basis of a periodic optimal control problem solved numerically. An averaging method reduces computation time by 80.5% while preserving fidelity for year-long optimization. A case study shows a projected total yearly energy cost of 5.93 EUR/m2 for combined heat and electricity, which is 73% lower than the German average. This study underscores the feasibility of designing economically viable, autonomous energy communities in real-world scenarios and provides an efficient, robust optimization framework for designing system components and operational control strategies.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07427","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.984706","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathoc","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":178,"author":"Wonsun Song, Jakob Harzer, Christopher Jung, Leon Sander, Moritz Diehl","raw_content_length":1326,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.89,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Germany","Freiburg"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1325,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Novel Numerical Method","Simultaneous Design and Control Optimization","Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage Systems","arXiv250107427v2 Announce Type","Abstract","The transition","a carbon-neutral energy system","widespread deployment","renewable energy sources","economically feasible energy storage solutions"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage Systems","renewable energy sources","economically feasible energy storage solutions"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Novel Numerical Method":2.0,"Simultaneous Design and Control Optimization":2.0,"Seasonal Thermal Energy Storage Systems":2.0,"arXiv250107427v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The transition":1.0,"a carbon-neutral energy system":1.0,"widespread deployment":1.0,"renewable energy sources":1.0,"economically feasible energy storage solutions":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7844725300000004,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.746500000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9493,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8615,"joy":0.0445,"surprise":0.0482,"sadness":0.0079,"fear":0.0087,"anger":0.0213,"disgust":0.0078},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":6,"deployment_readiness":4,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a numerical method for optimizing seasonal thermal energy storage systems.

We look for the relaxed equilibrium as a randomized stopping policy, which is formulated as a fixed point of a set-valued mapping, whose existence is challenging by direct arguments. To overcome the difficulties caused by the presence of a major player, we propose to study an auxiliary problem by considering entropy regularization in the major player's problem while formulating the minor players' optimal stopping problems as linear programming over occupation measures. We first show the existence of regularized equilibria as fixed points of some simplified set-valued operator using the Kakutani-Fan-Glicksberg fixed-point theorem. Next, we prove that the regularized equilibrium converges as the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ tends to 0, and the limit corresponds to a fixed point of the original operator, thereby confirming the existence of a relaxed equilibrium in the original mean field game problem. We also extend this entropy regularization method to the mean-field game problem where the minor players choose optimal controls.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08770","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.985107","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathoc","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":183,"author":"Xiang Yu, Jiacheng Zhang, Keyu Zhang, Zhou Zhou","raw_content_length":1253,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.915,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Kakutani-Fan-Glicksberg"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1252,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv250108770v2 Announce Type","Abstract","This paper","a discrete-time major-minor mean field game","the major player","either an optimal control","time","the relaxed equilibrium","a randomized stopping policy","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv250108770v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This paper":1.0,"a discrete-time major-minor mean field game":1.0,"the major player":1.0,"either an optimal control":1.0,"time":1.0,"the relaxed equilibrium":1.0,"a randomized stopping policy":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7844878908333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.6165,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4767,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8181,"joy":0.0567,"surprise":0.0812,"sadness":0.0145,"fear":0.0135,"anger":0.0134,"disgust":0.0027},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a theoretical framework for optimizing decision-making in mean field games, specifically focusing on optimal control and stopping times.

We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site\" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor.

The latter condition produces equations for equilibrium configurations of systems of interacting particles under the sole condition that interactions are pairwise and along the line determined by each pair of particles. Complying external forces are admitted, so the description of some dynamical equilibrium configurations, such as relative equilibria in Celestial Mechanics, is included in our approach. Moments provide a unified framework for equilibrium problems in arbitrary dimensions. The equilibrium equations are homogeneous, of relatively low degree, invariant by oriented isometries (for interactions depending only on mutual distances), and are obtained through simple algebraic procedures requiring neither reduction by isometries nor a variational principle for their determination. Our equations include the renowned sets of $n$-body central configuration equations by O. Dziobek, and by A. Albouy and A. Chenciner. These equations are extended to a rather broad class of equilibrium problems, and several new sets of equilibrium equations are introduced. We also apply moments to establish a theory of constraints for mutual distances of configurations of fixed dimension and of co-spherical configurations, thus re-obtaining and adding to classical results by A. Cayley, among others.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13865","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:49.997089","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","research","preprints","mathematics","math-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Eduardo S.

However, existing methods mostly focus on either deterministic cases or problems with linear constraints. The main challenge in stochastic cases with general constraints is the bias and variance of the hyper-gradient, arising from the inexact solution of the lower-level problem. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic augmented Lagrangian value function method for solving stochastic bilevel optimization problems with nonlinear lower-level constraints. Our approach reformulates the original bilevel problem using an augmented Lagrangian-based value function and then applies a penalized stochastic gradient method that carefully manages the noise from stochastic oracles. We establish an equivalence between the stochastic single-level reformulation and the original constrained bilevel problem and provide a non-asymptotic rate of convergence for the proposed method. The rate is further enhanced by employing variance reduction techniques. Extensive experiments on synthetic problems and real-world applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24249","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:50.007008","language":"en","tags":["research","mathematics","mathoc","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":156,"author":"Hantao Nie, Jiaxiang Li, Zaiwen Wen","raw_content_length":1213,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.78,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["An Augmented Lagrangian Value Function Method for Lower arXiv:2509.24249v2 Announce Type"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1212,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["An Augmented Lagrangian Value Function Method","arXiv250924249v2 Announce Type","Abstract","lower-level constrained bilevel optimization","increasing attention","existing methods","either deterministic cases","problems","linear constraints","The main challenge"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["lower-level constrained bilevel optimization"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"An Augmented Lagrangian Value Function Method":2.0,"arXiv250924249v2 Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"lower-level constrained bilevel optimization":1.0,"increasing attention":1.0,"existing methods":1.0,"either deterministic cases":1.0,"problems":1.0,"linear constraints":1.0,"The main challenge":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7851161516666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8773,"joy":0.0201,"surprise":0.0568,"sadness":0.0092,"fear":0.0124,"anger":0.0176,"disgust":0.0066},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper proposes a novel stochastic augmented Lagrangian value function method for solving stochastic bilevel optimization problems with nonlinear lower-level constraints.

{"id":"science_arxiv_math_2d61f008c839","title":"The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes","content":"arXiv:2504.12370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity. In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse.

A subclass of this problem, the Discretizable Distance Geometry Problem (DDGP), allows a recursive solution via the combinatorial Branch-and-Prune (BP) algorithm by exploiting specific vertex orderings in protein backbones. To accommodate the inherent uncertainty in NMR data, the interval Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}BP) algorithm was introduced, incorporating interval distance constraints through uniform sampling. In this work, we propose two new algorithmic frameworks for solving the three-dimensional interval DDGP (\\textit{i}DDGP): the interval Angular Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}ABP), and its extension, the interval Torsion-angle Branch-and-Prune (\\textit{i}TBP). These methods convert interval distances into angular constraints, enabling structured sampling over circular arcs. The \\textit{i}ABP method guarantees feasibility by construction and removes the need for explicit constraint checking. The \\textit{i}TBP algorithm further incorporates known torsion angle intervals, enforcing local chirality and planarity conditions critical for protein geometry. We present formal mathematical foundations for both methods and a systematic strategy for generating biologically meaningful \\textit{i}DDGP instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. Computational experiments demonstrate that both \\textit{i}ABP and \\textit{i}TBP consistently outperform \\textit{i}BP in terms of solution rate and computational efficiency. In particular, \\textit{i}TBP yields solutions with lower RMSD variance relative to the original PDB structures, better reflecting biologically plausible conformations.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09143","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:50.022560","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathematics","q-biobm","mathmg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Wagner A.

Even within specialized subfields, comparisons across textbooks and journals reveals that the basics are subject to considerable variation and controversy. This variation is often obscured by the singular viewpoints presented within textbooks and journal guidelines, which may be deceptively written as if the norms they adopt are unchallenged. Furthermore, human limitations and the vastness within fields imply that no one can have expertise across all subfields and that interpretations will be severely constrained by the limitations of studies of human populations. The present chapter outlines an approach to statistical methods that attempts to recognize these problems from the start, rather than assume they are absent as in the claims of 'statistical significance' and 'confidence' ordinarily attached to statistical tests and interval estimates.

In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386","published_date":"2025-10-13T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:41:50.023450","language":"en","tags":["astro-phim","research","preprints","mathematics","astro-phsr","mathap","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Ha Pham, Florian Faucher, Damien Fournier, H\\'el\\`ene Barucq, Laurent Gizon","raw_content_length":1861,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":1.29,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG","Green"],"persons":["Galbrun"],"locations":["Sun"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1860,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["oscillations","Numerical simulations","axisymmetric solar backgrounds","differential rotation","gravity","arXiv250819386v4","Announce Type","replace-cross Abstract","Local helioseismology comprises","imaging and inversion techniques"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"oscillations":3.0,"Numerical simulations":2.0,"axisymmetric solar backgrounds":2.0,"differential rotation":2.0,"gravity":2.0,"arXiv250819386v4":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"replace-cross Abstract":1.0,"Local helioseismology comprises":1.0,"imaging and inversion techniques":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7855856177777776,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.909,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3818,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9165,"joy":0.0214,"surprise":0.0354,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.0068,"anger":0.0106,"disgust":0.0056},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article focuses on numerical simulations of solar oscillations, which is basic research.

The $\\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert.

The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, which is equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_43998a542551","title":"PUMILIOs and m6A","content":"PUMILIO/Fem-3 Binding Factor (PUF) proteins are conserved eukaryotic mRNA-binding proteins. Higher plants encode an expanded family of PUF proteins with 26 members in Arabidopsis thaliana of which 6 (PUM1-PUM6) have a domain organization equivalent to metazoan PUF proteins implicated in mRNA regulation. Here, we show that the PUF proteins PUM2 and PUM6 are expressed in mitotically active cells of root and shoot meristems, while PUM5 is mostly expressed in the differentiation zone of root meristems exiting from active division. Increased PUM2 dosage in proliferating cells causes growth repression and developmental delay reminiscent of mutants with defects in cytoplasmic YTHDF proteins that bind to N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA. Remarkably, even weak defects in the m6A-YTHDF system enhance the effect of increased PUM2 dosage. In line with this genetic interaction, mRNA targets overlap significantly between PUFs and the major YTHDF proteins ECT2 and ECT3. Furthermore, the enrichment of the core PUF recognition motif URUAY around m6A sites is largely explained by PUF targeting, not by direct URUAY methylation as previously suggested. Our results indicate that the balance between the reciprocal activities of the deeply conserved cytoplasmic RNA binding protein families PUF and YTHDF is an important element of growth control in plants.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681827v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.374479","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Chen, J., Sanges Ametlle, M., Rennie, S., Arribas-Hernandez, L., Brodersen, P.","raw_content_length":1354,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.0,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PUM1-PUM6","YTHDF","ECT2","PUF","PUM5"],"persons":["ECT3"],"locations":["PUM6"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1354,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["PUMILIOs","PUF proteins","PUM6","PUMILIOFem-3 Binding Factor PUF proteins","eukaryotic mRNA-binding proteins","Higher plants","an expanded family","26 members","Arabidopsis thaliana","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"PUMILIOs":2.0,"PUF proteins":2.0,"PUM6":2.0,"PUMILIOFem-3 Binding Factor PUF proteins":1.0,"eukaryotic mRNA-binding proteins":1.0,"Higher plants":1.0,"an expanded family":1.0,"26 members":1.0,"Arabidopsis thaliana":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":30.78645199888889,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.904,"joy":0.0148,"surprise":0.0358,"sadness":0.0087,"fear":0.003,"anger":0.0141,"disgust":0.0197},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents research on the interaction between PUF and YTHDF proteins in plants, which is a basic research finding.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_319c64e2482b","title":"Conservation and divergence of sex","content":"In sexually dimorphic species, sex-biased gene expression plays an important role in driving morphological, physiological, and behavioral differences between males and females. Here, we examined patterns of sex-biased gene expression within and among 6 Drosophila species with divergence times ranging from 2-50 million years. We detected contrasting patterns of sex bias conservation and turnover between heads and bodies, with more extensive sex-biased expression and greater conservation of sex-biased expression in the body, but more species-specific turnover of sex-biased expression in the head, where conserved, unbiased expression was common. Interestingly, in both body parts lineage-specific gains of sex-biased expression occurred most often via concordant expression changes in both sexes that differed only in their magnitude, with this pattern being particularly strong in the head, suggesting that the majority of lineage-specific sex bias gains do not represent a resolution of sexual antagonism, but instead reflect regulatory changes shared between the sexes. We detected an enrichment of putatively positively selected expression changes among sex-biased genes in both body parts. Taken together, our findings suggest sex-biased changes may often be facilitated by selection acting on the sex with lower expression, especially for male expression of female-biased genes in the body. We also detected differences in the proportion of sex-biased genes located on the X chromosome depending on sex bias and body part. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the dynamics of sex-biased gene expression, as well as the molecular mechanisms and selective forces underlying its turnover, across short and long evolutionary timescales.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681669v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.375118","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Glaser-Schmitt, A., Parsch, J.","raw_content_length":1755,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.245,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Drosophila"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":["2-50 million years"]},"char_count":1755,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["sex","Conservation","divergence","sex-biased gene expression","sexually dimorphic species","an important role","morphological physiological and behavioral differences","males","females","patterns"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"sex":3.0,"Conservation":2.0,"divergence":2.0,"sex-biased gene expression":2.0,"sexually dimorphic species":1.0,"an important role":1.0,"morphological physiological and behavioral differences":1.0,"males":1.0,"females":1.0,"patterns":1.0}},"age_hours":30.786482093611113,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.7,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.34,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8662,"joy":0.0053,"surprise":0.0331,"sadness":0.0111,"fear":0.0073,"anger":0.0212,"disgust":0.0559},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research examines sex-biased gene expression in Drosophila species, providing insights into evolutionary biology.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_df41b94ae3d4","title":"Rax1/2 promote memory of growth by early Ras1 activation to maintain polarity across generations","content":"As polarized cells divide, daughter cells must re-establish polarity at the correct site to maintain their shape. Fission yeast cells are bipolar, however growth initiates first at the old end of the cell that was inherited from the mother. This dominance of the old end is dependent on that end having grown in the previous generation, suggesting cells must be able to recognize when an end has a previous history of growth. We find that the proteins Rax1/2 act as markers for memory of growth by localizing to growing cell ends and remaining through division. Rax1/2 then promote activation of Ras1-GTPase at dividing cell ends by recruitment of its GEF Efc25. Localized Ras1 activity at the old ends ensures timely activation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 to initiate polarized growth, providing an advantage to the old end. Through this work, we demonstrate the role of a Ras-GTPase in positioning the site of polarization and maintaining cell shape across multiple generations.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681675v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.375415","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Vickers, W.

Methods: Bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) from children with asthma were differentiated to an organotypic epithelium and primed via co-culture with healthy donor Th17 lymphocytes for 4 days prior to apical infection with human rhinovirus-16 (RV-16). RNA sequencing with WGCNA analysis was performed to identify modules of gene expression altered by Th17 priming or RV-16 infection in BECs or Th17 cells. Gene expression was correlated with viral copy number and with secreted protein levels. Results: Analysis identified 4,030 genes grouped into 9 named modules with differential gene expression in BECs due to Th17 priming and viral infection. Modules with increased expression with Th17 priming and RV-16 infection included Interferon, MAP-kinase and TNF Signaling modules, while expression of Cilia structure/function and Metabolism modules were decreased. Th17 cells co-cultured with RV-16 infected BECs exhibited increased expression of an Interferon and Viral Response Module without detectable direct viral infection of Th17 cells. Increased expression of the Interferon Signaling in BECs and Interferon Response in Th17 cells was correlated with increased viral copy number in BECs. Th17 priming of BECs led to increased secretion of IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, and IL-1{beta} following RV-16 as compared to BECs alone. Conclusions: Th17 lymphocytes enhance epithelial interferon responses to RV-16 infection in bronchial epithelium from asthmatic children.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681711v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.375715","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":224,"author":"Powell, W.

Mortality in severely malnourished children is often attributed to common infectious diseases, including enteric infections. It has been proposed that impaired intestinal barrier function contributes to mortality, but direct evidence is limited and thus there exists a need to develop improved preclinical models to test these and other mechanistic hypotheses. In this study, we aimed to describe differences in response to enteric inflammation and infection in the colon of malnourished mice compared to well-nourished littermates. C57Bl/6 male weanlings were fed isocaloric diets, either a low 1% protein diet (LPD) or a control 18% protein diet (CPD) for 2-weeks either in combination with oral administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), or . LPD-fed mice were more susceptible to DSS or as evidenced by increased clinical severity scores, and reaching their humane endpoints. LPD-fed mice also showed more signs of colonic dysfunction with reduced levels of tight junction proteins, higher colonic pathogen load, and increased systemic inflammation and bacterial spread. Taken together, these observations show that malnourished animals have increased susceptibility to intestinal dysfunction caused by either chemical exposure or infection.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_831c96b44f4a","title":"Integrative Computational Analysis Reveals H. pylori GroEL as a Stabilizer of Neurotoxic Amyloid","content":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) aggregation, with soluble oligomers implicated as the most neurotoxic species. Recent evidence suggests microbial infections, including Helicobacter pylori, contribute to AD pathogenesis. This study investigates the role of H. pylori GroEL, a conserved chaperonin found in bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), in stabilizing toxic A{beta} oligomers. A pan-genome analysis of 353 H. pylori strains identified GroEL as a highly conserved protein present in 83% of strains, which supported its widespread relevance. We structurally modelled a conserved 27-amino acid GroEL fragment and docked it against the A{beta} (1-42) tetramer. Interaction analysis revealed stabilizing salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and extensive non-bonded contacts within the GroEL-A{beta} complex. Molecular dynamics simulations (50 ns) demonstrated that GroEL binding enhanced A{beta} oligomer stability, evidenced by reduced structural deviations and a more extensive hydrogen bonding network compared to A{beta} oligomer alone. These computational findings support a novel mechanism whereby H. pylori GroEL directly stabilizes soluble A{beta} oligomers. We hypothesize that this stabilization inhibits their aggregation into plaques while paradoxically prolonging the lifetime of neurotoxic species, potentially increasing neurodegeneration through pathways distinct from canonical amyloid deposition. This highlights the complex role of bacterial proteins in AD and underscores the need for experimental validation of GroEL-A{beta} interactions as a potential therapeutic target.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.679596v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.376598","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":211,"author":"Abdullah, W.

While CLas-positive (CLas+) females exhibit increased fecundity and metabolic demands, their neuroendocrine regulation remains unclear. We propose CLas manipulates dopamine (DA) signaling to enhance psyllid fecundity and CLas proliferation. Metabolomics revealed elevated DA in CLas+ females. Silencing DA synthesis genes and receptor DcDop2 via RNAi reduced lipid reserves, fecundity, and ovarian CLas titers. Through combined in vivo and in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that the microRNA miR-31a suppresses DcDop2 expression by binding to its 3 untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-31a resulted in decreased DcDop2 expression and CLas titers in the ovaries, eliciting phenotypic defects akin to DcDop2 knockdown. Furthermore, DcDop2 knockdown and miR-31a overexpression reduced juvenile hormone (JH) levels and adipokinetic hormone (AKH) signaling in fat bodies and ovaries. Consequently, CLas hijacks the DA/DcDop2-miR-31a-AKH-JH signaling cascade to improve D. citri lipid metabolism and fecundity, while simultaneously promoting its replication. These findings suggest a mutualistic interaction between CLas proliferation and ovarian development within the insect host that enrich our understanding of the molecular interplay between plant pathogens and vector insects and offer novel targets and strategies for the field management of HLB.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681724v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.377148","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":200,"author":"Nian, X., Li, J., Huang, J., Yuan, W., Holford, P., Beattie, G.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_ce6a1b6fdd64","title":"Direct comparison of constitutive Rax","content":"Purpose: Multiple mouse lines using constitutive or inducible Cre recombinase expression have taken advantage of the early optic field expression of the Rax/Rx gene and its subsequent, progressive restriction to retinal progenitors, retinal pigmented epithelium and the optic stalk. Among these, the constitutive transgenic lines, Rx3-Cre and Rax-Cre BAC Tg, are currently used by vision researchers. Here we directly compare their prenatal ocular and extra-ocular Cre activities. Methods: Rx3-Cre or Rax-Cre BAC transgenic male mice were mated to the Cre-dependent lineage tracer Ai9/tdTomato. The resulting live and fixed tissue expression for each line was evaluated at multiple stages of development, from the optic vesicle stage onward. Both whole embryo and immunolabeled cryosectioned material were digitally imaged. Results: Rx3-Cre recapitulates endogenous RAX protein expression at the optic vesicle and optic cup stages, but there is also ectopic Cre activity in periocular mesenchyme (POM), within PITX2- and PECAM-1-expressing subpopulations. We also show that ectopic Cre activity can include germline expression. Besides a small ectopic domain in developing limbs, the Rax-Cre BAC mouse driver fully recapitulates endogenous RAX expression in the embryonic and postnatal eye. Conclusions: We provide a systematic analysis of two Rax-Cre drivers during embryonic and postnatal eye development that are very useful to recapitulate severe congenital eye diseases. Data presented here strongly support the inclusion of lineage reporting and evaluation of littermates lacking a Cre transgene, whenever conditional targeting strategies are used in studies of optic vesicle-derived tissues.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681822v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.377463","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":238,"author":"Brown, N.

Direct reprogramming of astrocytes into neurons has emerged as a promising approach to restore lost neurons. Comprehensive mapping and characterization of candidate astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming factors is an essential step to realizing the potential of this strategy. Here, we established a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)-based approach for neuronal reprogramming of primary human astrocytes. We conducted high-throughput CRISPRa screens of all human genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) to identify novel and efficient reprogramming factors. scRNA-seq characterization of top hits revealed that single TFs reprogram primary human astrocytes into multiple neuronal subtypes with distinct cell type-specific gene signatures. We demonstrate that INSM1 reprograms astrocytes to a glutamatergic neuron-like state and has broad neurogenic activity across different cell types and across human and mouse contexts. Finally, we conduct paired CRISPRa screens to identify cofactors that cooperate with INSM1 to enhance neuronal reprogramming and subtype specification, and elucidate genomic mechanisms of interaction and downstream regulators.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681828v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.382872","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":159,"author":"Reisman, S.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_0821f45494e0","title":"Differentiation of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in vitro and during rice leaf infection","content":"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is classified as a xylem pathogen responsible for bacterial blight of rice causing substantial yield losses in Asia and Africa. Xoo virulence depends on the ability to trigger SWEET sucrose efflux transporters in the xylem parenchyma (XP) by injection of transcription activation like effectors (TALe) into host cells, likely to access host-derived sucrose. To establish infection, Xoo must overcome physical barriers, immune responses and the hydraulic xylem flow. To gain insights into the colonization process, we used translational SWEET11a-GUS reporter lines, scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy of Xoo tagged with a fluorescent protein. We found that Xoo can differentiate in vitro into filamentous forms. We mapped the infection route of Xoo along the vasculature, identified distinct spatiotemporal phases of Xoo colonization marked by rod-shaped and, notably, filamentous Xoo cells. Rod-shaped Xoo were found to attach to xylem pits during basipetal progression of the infection. Notably, we found that at later infection stages, Xoo could enter the XP. Strikingly, subsequently Xoo forms filament that can traverse bundle sheath cells and enter into the mesophyll. Chlorosis and necrosis of leaves is thus likely not just due to blockage of xylem flow, but to direct tissue damage. Filamentation had been reported as important for virulence of human pathogens e.g. Yersinia pestis, uropathogenic E. coli and Shigella and had been associated to sugar utilization in Bacillus subtilis.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_c3c27dadbb6b","title":"Macrophage efferocytosis is controlled by epigenetic modifications mediated by RBPJ","content":"Efferocytosis, phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells, is crucial for inflammation resolution and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. However, it is not known how epigenetic alterations govern macrophage-mediated efferocytosis. A Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) sequencing revealed a genome-wide selective suppression of H3K9me3, a heterochromatin mark that represses gene activity, in macrophages undergoing efferocytosis. Moreover, Recombination Signal Binding Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J region (RBPJ), which is a transcription factor typically involved in the canonical Notch signaling process, dampened this epigenetic modification, enhanced apoptotic cell clearance, and suppressed inflammation by mouse atherosclerotic plaque, alveolar, peritoneal, and bone marrow-derived macrophages and human primary macrophages. Inhibition of the Notch signaling in macrophages significantly reduced efferocytosis whereas activation of this signaling augmented apoptotic debris clearance. Mechanistically, RBPJ upregulated Stard13 and Arsg by diminishing H3K9me3 on their promoters. Stard13 promoted efferocytosis by magnifying actin polymerization via inhibition and activation of Rho and RAC GTPases, respectively. Genetic and pharmacological inhibitions of SUV39H1/H2, the methyltransferases that are responsible for H3K9 trimethylation, amplified the expression of Stard13 and Arsg, and augmented efferocytosis by RBPJ-/- macrophages. In sum, this study shows epigenetic regulation of efferocytosis in tissue macrophages.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681723v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.383852","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":191,"author":"Dutta, P., Sadaf, S., Zhang, X., Lei, L., Jixing, S., Jamal, I., Modugu, G.","raw_content_length":1558,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.955,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["H3K9me3","Recombination Signal Binding Protein","Release Using Nuclease","Notch","RBPJ Efferocytosis"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1554,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Macrophage efferocytosis","epigenetic modifications","RBPJ","Efferocytosis","phagocytic clearance","apoptotic cells","inflammation resolution","maintenance","tissue homeostasis","how epigenetic alterations"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["maintenance"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Macrophage efferocytosis":2.0,"epigenetic modifications":2.0,"RBPJ":2.0,"Efferocytosis":1.0,"phagocytic clearance":1.0,"apoptotic cells":1.0,"inflammation resolution":1.0,"maintenance":1.0,"tissue homeostasis":1.0,"how epigenetic alterations":1.0}},"age_hours":30.78667109027778,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.409,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.3182,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.809,"joy":0.004,"surprise":0.0237,"sadness":0.0205,"fear":0.0211,"anger":0.0279,"disgust":0.0937},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is basic research identifying a novel epigenetic mechanism (RBPJ-mediated H3K9me3 suppression) that enhances efferocytosis.

The CALLOSE DEFICIENT MICROSPORE 1 (CDM1) gene of Arabidopsis has been previously characterized as being required for callose metabolism and its loss results in defects in microspore wall development, degeneration of meiotic products, and male sterility. We report here that CDM1 is required for normal meiosis I progression, meiotic chromosome organization, and maintenance of DNA integrity. CDM1 is part of the ATM dependent DNA damage response in dividing vegetative tissues. The cdm1 mutant shows defects in meiotic chromosome condensation, arrest at metaphase I, susceptibility to chromosome breakage in rDNA regions, defects in positioning of the products of meiosis, and increased expression of recombination related genes. However, fidelity of chromosome segregation is not affected. Furthermore, the meiotic phenotype of cdm1 is independent of SPO11 induced meiotic double strand breaks. CDM1 protein displays granular localization in meiosis throughout the cytoplasm that resembles that of mRNP granules. The results show that CDM1 is required for maintenance of proper chromosome organization and DNA integrity in the course of male meiosis. The chromosomal defects in cdm1 may originate from regions of defective or incomplete replication.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681646v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.384136","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":197,"author":"Davda, J.

The free energy released at a given step(s) of the ATPase cycle is converted into mechanical work. Therefore, it has long been thought that ATP is the energy source for mechanical work. Here, we show that the double-headed myosin V (M5) motor can perform ATP-free walking. In the presence of ADP, M5 bound to F-actin by both heads makes a forward step when the trailing head is detached by an external force. This forward step harnesses the strain energy in the leading (L) head, provided from the strong binding energy between the L-head and actin. Consequently, strain generation reduces the binding affinity, which manifests as sporadic, brief L-head detachment. Strain generation and brief L-head detachment also occur during ATP-dependent walking to similar extents as during ATP-free walking. These results suggest that the strong binding energy is also converted into mechanical work during ATP-dependent walking.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681800v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.384421","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":157,"author":"Kodera, N., Flechsig, H., Uchihashi, T., Ando, T.","raw_content_length":1009,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.785,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ATP","ATPase"],"persons":["myosin V (M5"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1009,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ATP","Energy conversion mechanism","mechanical work","The mechanical processes","ATPase protein motors","their ATPase reactions","The free energy","a given steps","the ATPase cycle","the energy source"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ATP":3.0,"Energy conversion mechanism":2.0,"mechanical work":2.0,"The mechanical processes":1.0,"ATPase protein motors":1.0,"their ATPase reactions":1.0,"The free energy":1.0,"a given steps":1.0,"the ATPase cycle":1.0,"the energy source":1.0}},"age_hours":30.786703043055557,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.1125,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8225,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9002,"joy":0.0098,"surprise":0.0108,"sadness":0.0026,"fear":0.0136,"anger":0.0235,"disgust":0.0396},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This research reveals a novel energy conversion mechanism in myosin V, suggesting that strong binding energy, not just ATP, contributes to mechanical work.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_4b9ee41795f9","title":"ACETYLATED α","content":"Disruptions in the microtubule cytoskeleton play a role in various neurological diseases that afflict a large fraction of the population. Microtubule function is regulated by post-translational modifications like acetylation, and one consistently identified acetylation site in mammals and Drosophila melanogaster is -tubulin lysine 394 (K394). Our previous research demonstrated that an acetylation-blocking point mutation--K394R--causes a decrease in microtubule stability in axon terminals at the developing neuromuscular junction. Here, we asked whether K394 acetylation regulates the development of additional neuronal structures. Using the central brain mushroom body as a model, we found that K394R results in lobe overextension at the midline. The K394R phenotype manifests during metamorphosis and affects lobe growth in a cell-autonomous manner. Our data suggest that the K394R phenotype may result from changes in Tau, a microtubule-associated protein enriched in the mushroom body and known to play a critical role in regulating neuronal microtubules. Knocking-out tau resulted in defects in midline crossing similar to K394R. However, when the loss of tau was combined with K394R, lobe extension was normal indicating that the loss of tau suppresses the K394R phenotype and vice versa. While overexpressing tau also resulted in a midline crossing phenotype, K394R in combination with elevated Tau resulted in a severely malformed mushroom body. Altogether, our work suggests that K394R interacts with tau to regulate axon outgrowth during mushroom body development and raises the potential of manipulating K394 acetylation to ameliorate neurological disease resulting from axonal growth defects and changes in Tau.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681650v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.385179","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":245,"author":"Welch, C.

To test the effectiveness of DNA metabarcoding to identify fish species and to capture seasonal variations in local ichthyofauna, monthly ichthyoplankton and 2 L water samples were collected over 13 months in the lower section of the Guadiana River Estuary in southeast Portugal. Both sample types underwent high-throughput sequencing for three genetic markers (COI, 12S, 16S), with morphological identification also performed for ichthyoplankton. Bulk and water samples identified a total of 131 fish species throughout the year. DNA metabarcoding demonstrated higher taxonomic resolution and diversity detection, with 115 species recovered, while morphology identified only 23 species. Ichthyoplankton metabarcoding also detected 40% more fish than water eDNA, recovering almost the double of species despite the fact that both approaches used the same metabarcoding primers. The integration of multiple molecular markers was crucial to maximize diversity detection in both DNA-based methods. In addition, DNA metabarcoding was able to identify ichthyofaunal spawning periods and captured significant seasonal variations in fish community, with higher diversity observed during the warmer months. With this strategy, around 66% of the historically recorded ichthyoplankton taxa in the region were identified, along with several new records. The findings demonstrated the capability of (e)DNA metabarcoding to uncover seasonal variations in the regional fish community, provided new insights on the ichthyofauna of the Guadiana Estuary, and revealed the need for more in-depth studies to improve the efficiency of multiple sampling methods for fish species identification.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681914v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.385505","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":249,"author":"Ferreira, A.

This study introduces ProteusFold, a compact and interpretable model with only 993,408 parameters that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on modest hardware with an inference time of 0.0011 seconds. By framing folding as an unfolded-to-folded sequence transformation using a novel structural tokenization, ProteusFold reduces regression complexity while preserving bond connectivity through the concept of \"Synapses.\" It achieves near-atomic fidelity (RMSD 0.24 [A], GDT-TS 99.85) and excels in protein-protein docking with a mean DockQ of 0.7675, with 95.5% of complexes above the 0.23 threshold. Compared to AlphaFold2's Predicted Aligned Error (6.28), ProteusFold attains 0.396, representing an order-of-magnitude gain in positional accuracy. Beyond accuracy and efficiency, the model provides residue-level attribution analyses that highlight biologically significant residues, serving as a preliminary guide for experiments. Furthermore, ProteusFold is the first to provide atomic-level attribution of key electronic and thermal properties, offering deeper insight into folding mechanisms and pinpointing the specific atoms responsible for distinct scenarios.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_b8dec2f1f458","title":"Evaluation of antibiotic and peptide vaccine strategies for mirror bacterial infections","content":"Recent advances in synthetic biology have raised concerns that the creation of bacteria composed completely of mirror-image biomolecules may be possible in the coming decades. Such mirror bacteria could pose an unprecedented biosecurity risk, as they are predicted to be highly virulent pathogens resulting from severe immune evasion. Pharmaceutical interventions, including antibiotics and vaccines, could likely provide some limited protection in the event of a mirror bacterial outbreak. Understanding the feasibility of specific pharmaceutical antimirror strategies may help inform the appropriate measures to confront the risks of mirror bacteria. Here, we experimentally evaluated the prospects of previously proposed antimirror antibiotic and vaccine strategies. First, we assessed the expected efficacy of existing antibiotics chloramphenicol, linezolid, tedizolid, and aztreonam against mirror bacteria by characterizing the antibacterial activities of their enantiomers against natural-chirality bacteria. We found that ent-chloramphenicol, ent-linezolid, ent-tedizolid, and ent-aztreonam exhibited minimal antibiotic activity, suggesting that their parent antibiotics would be ineffective against mirror bacterial infections. Second, to explore whether the enantiomers of existing antibiotics could be suitable as antimirror antibiotics, we evaluated the acute toxicities of ent-chloramphenicol, ent-linezolid, ent-tedizolid, and ent-aztreonam in mice, finding that these compounds have favorable acute toxicity profiles compatible with their continued development. Finally, we investigated D-peptide-based approaches to antimirror vaccines, finding that three bacterially-derived D-peptides induced robust D-peptide-specific antibody responses in mice when conjugated to a carrier protein and adjuvanted. Our results support previous suggestions that the enantiomers of existing antibiotics and D-peptide conjugate vaccines represent feasible pharmaceutical strategies against mirror bacterial infections.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.10.681688v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.386097","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":248,"author":"Kleinman, A., Torres, J., Wang, B.","raw_content_length":2017,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.24,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["aztreonam"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2017,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Evaluation","antibiotic and peptide vaccine strategies","mirror bacterial infections","Recent advances","synthetic biology","concerns","the creation","bacteria","mirror-image biomolecules","the coming decades"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["antibiotic and peptide vaccine strategies"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Evaluation":2.0,"antibiotic and peptide vaccine strategies":2.0,"mirror bacterial infections":2.0,"Recent advances":1.0,"synthetic biology":1.0,"concerns":1.0,"the creation":1.0,"bacteria":1.0,"mirror-image biomolecules":1.0,"the coming decades":1.0}},"age_hours":30.78677817722222,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.7049999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.659,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2546,"joy":0.0059,"surprise":0.0102,"sadness":0.0124,"fear":0.6218,"anger":0.0483,"disgust":0.0466},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research into potential pharmaceutical interventions for mirror bacterial infections.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_0515cf4a3b83","title":"Inferring antibiotic resistance selection in the environment can be confounded by correlations between resistance genes and unrelated functional traits","content":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a silent pandemic that is coupled with other crises such as climate change in the polycrisis humanity is facing. One of the key questions is whether antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are selected for at the low antibiotic concentrations typical for most environments. Many studies have observed changes in the relative abundance of ARGs from one environmental compartment to the next, e.g. from wastewater treatment plant influent to effluent. Fewer studies have directly tested for selection by incubating environmental samples in mesocosms or laboratory models at different concentrations of antibiotics to infer minimal selective concentrations. We developed a mathematical model to demonstrate that these studies can be confounded by shifts in the microbial community composition that occur when a microbiome is transported from one environmental compartment to another or when incubated under different conditions. Such community shifts will confound tests of selection when there is an association between carriage of ARGs and other functional traits. As an example, we show that there is a phylum-dependent association between the number of ARGs and the number of ribosomal RNA genes, which are both higher in fast growing, copiotrophic bacteria. We then show that specific growth rate or nutrient concentration upshifts increased the proportion of copiotrophs in the community and thus the relative abundance of ARGs. This result generalizes to community shifts for other reasons if there is some association between ARGs and ecological niches. Therefore, most studies of selection for ARGs in the environment are confounded. Solutions are proposed.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681873v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.386416","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":250,"author":"Uluseker, C., Raguideau, S., Quince, C., Kreft, J.-U.","raw_content_length":1692,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AMR"],"persons":[],"locations":["Antimicrobial"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1692,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Inferring antibiotic resistance selection","the environment","correlations","resistance genes","unrelated functional traits","ARGs","Antimicrobial resistance","AMR","a silent pandemic","other crises"],"filter_categories":{"engineering":["Inferring antibiotic resistance selection"],"ai_ml":["unrelated functional traits"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Inferring antibiotic resistance selection":2.0,"the environment":2.0,"correlations":2.0,"resistance genes":2.0,"unrelated functional traits":2.0,"ARGs":2.0,"Antimicrobial resistance":1.0,"AMR":1.0,"a silent pandemic":1.0,"other crises":1.0}},"age_hours":30.786793643055553,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":3.634,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.2732,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.867,"joy":0.0022,"surprise":0.0197,"sadness":0.0191,"fear":0.0198,"anger":0.0232,"disgust":0.049},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a mathematical model demonstrating that studies of antibiotic resistance gene selection in the environment can be confounded by shifts in microbial community composition.

A family of S. aureus serine hydrolases are important regulators of virulence and biofilm formation. Among these, FphE is highly specific to S. aureus and therefor a viable target for both imaging and therapy. Here, we present bioinformatic and structural evidence that FphE may be involved in aromatic compound metabolism. In addition, twelve distinct crystal forms reveal that FphE exists as a highly unusual but stable and flexible, cross-subunit homodimer, unique to the large alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. Substrate engagement favors retention of the dimeric state, which is a more catalytically active form of the enzyme and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirms the dimeric architecture occurs in solution. High-resolution co-crystal structures of FphE covalently bound to two chemically distinct ligands reveal different modes of active site engagement, supporting an atypical structural plasticity of the dimer interface. Together, these findings establish FphE as a structurally unique alpha/beta hydrolase and provide a foundation for structure-guided development of S. aureus specific inhibitors and imaging probes.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681921v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.386694","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Jo, J., Upadhyay, T., You, X., Bennett, J.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_5129c2c4a5b3","title":"Dynamical buffering of reconfiguration dynamics in intrinsically disordered proteins","content":"Although they populate diverse conformational ensembles, intrinsically disordered proteins have well-defined functions determined by their equilibrium and dynamic properties. Such properties can be probed by single-molecule FRET experiments, which have revealed a strong dependence of the equilibrium degree of compaction on sequence for a set of 16 naturally occurring disordered regions of the same length from RNA-binding proteins. Remarkably, however, we find chain reconfiguration times measured for the same proteins to be almost independent of sequence, although chain dynamics would be expected to be slower for more compact proteins because of stronger intrachain interactions leading to increased internal friction. We investigate this effect with the aid of multi-microsecond, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations of all 16 disordered proteins. The simulations reproduce the experimental FRET efficiencies across the sequence set with near-quantitative accuracy. Explicitly including the FRET dyes improves agreement while minimally perturbing the protein ensemble, with residual deviations arising mainly from slightly overstabilized salt bridges. The simulations further reproduce the experimentally observed lack of correlation between reconfiguration times and chain dimensions across sequences. We are able to rationalize this observation as arising from two compensating factors as the chains get more compact: The narrowing of end-to-end equilibrium distance distributions and a concomitant reduction of the effective end-to-end diffusion coefficients have opposite effects that result in the the small variation of reconfiguration times with protein collapse, helping to \"buffer\" the effect of sequence on linker dynamics.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.12.681911v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-12T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:42:21.386990","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","biology","life-sciences","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Ivanovic, M.

TILs are manufactured by expanding and reinfusing tumor-reactive T cells from tumor biopsies. Efficacy of TIL therapies has been limited by the heterogeneity of expanded TIL products and the high prevalence of dysfunctional exhausted CD8+ T cells (TEX). While a subset of CD8+ TILs co-expressing CD103 and CD39 are enriched for tumor-reactive TILs across multiple cancer types, these cells are often in the TEX state with low proliferative potential. To identify regulators of human TIL proliferation, we screened an open reading frame library encoding for all human transcription factors (TFs). RELB emerged as the dominant driver of human TIL expansion with a skew towards CD8+ cells. TCR diversity was maintained after multiple days of in vitro expansion driven by RELB. Transcriptome profiling of multiple RELB-expressing TIL subtypes revealed a shift towards a memory/costimulatory-like phenotype. Using a HER2-targeting CAR and tumor co-culture model, RELB conferred improved persistence after multiple tumor challenges in vitro and improved solid tumor control in mouse xenografts in vivo. Finally, co-culture of RELB-overexpressing TILs with patient-matched tumor organoids showed an increase in TIL product polyfunctionality, tumor reactivity, and tumor killing.
