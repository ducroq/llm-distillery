However, MTS operations face disruptions from natural disasters, man-made disturbances, or cascading combinations of these events. These threats can disrupt trade routes, pose serious risks to personnel, and damage critical port infrastructure. In today's advanced technological world, MTS also face growing threats from cyberattack and terrorist attack. Given these evolving risks, efforts to ensure resilience in port operations must be more inclusive, reflecting the full spectrum of potential threats. This article focuses on two key aspects of maritime transportation supply chain resilience (MTSCR): operational excellence and system technology. It presents a structured review framework of relevant literature including research papers and government documents, to explore strategies for strengthening MTSCR. The article classifies the review findings and highlights vulnerable areas requiring future research.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09844","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.618826","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicssoc-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":153,"author":"Digvijay Redekar, Ronald Askin, Feng Ju","raw_content_length":1154,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.765,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Maritime Port Supply Chain Resilience: A Systematic Review","MTS"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1153,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Maritime Port Supply Chain Resilience","A Systematic Review","arXiv251009844v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Maritime transportation systems","MTS","a crucial role","the uninterrupted supply","essential goods","services"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Maritime Port Supply Chain Resilience"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Maritime Port Supply Chain Resilience":2.0,"A Systematic Review":2.0,"arXiv251009844v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Maritime transportation systems":1.0,"MTS":1.0,"a crucial role":1.0,"the uninterrupted supply":1.0,"essential goods":1.0,"services":1.0}},"age_hours":2.773951035,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.937,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8126,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.1876,"joy":0.0057,"surprise":0.0079,"sadness":0.0343,"fear":0.7333,"anger":0.0246,"disgust":0.0067},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":4,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article is a systematic review of literature on maritime transportation supply chain resilience.

The model is specifically designed to allow a more flexible calibration of crack nucleation than existing anisotropic fracture formulations, while avoiding the introduction of multiple damage variables. In addition to the classical components of anisotropic phase-field models based on a single damage variable -- namely, anisotropic elasticity and the extension of the fracture energy density via a second-order structural tensor -- the proposed approach introduces fracture anisotropy through a cohesive degradation function with potentially distinct cohesive lengths along the principal material directions. For this reason, we refer to it as multi-cohesive model. This feature enables independent control of the critical stresses governing crack nucleation in each material direction. We analyze the homogeneous solution and its second-order stability, and we compare the resulting strength surfaces with those of two representative anisotropic phase-field models available in the literature. Finally, numerical simulations in two and three dimensions demonstrate the capability of the proposed model to independently control crack nucleation and propagation in anisotropic fracture problems of increasing complexity.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11309","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.677324","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsapp-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":182,"author":"Angela Maria Fajardo Lacave, Francesco Vicentini, Fabian Welschinger, Laura De Lorenzis","raw_content_length":1358,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.91,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1357,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A variational phase","arXiv251011309v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","a novel variational phase-field model","fracture","anisotropic materials","The model","a more flexible calibration","crack nucleation","existing anisotropic fracture formulations"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A variational phase":2.0,"arXiv251011309v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"a novel variational phase-field model":1.0,"fracture":1.0,"anisotropic materials":1.0,"The model":1.0,"a more flexible calibration":1.0,"crack nucleation":1.0,"existing anisotropic fracture formulations":1.0}},"age_hours":2.774968010833333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"sentiment_score":2.3605,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5279,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8527,"joy":0.0276,"surprise":0.082,"sadness":0.0059,"fear":0.0091,"anger":0.0154,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel phase-field model for fracture in anisotropic materials.

These quantities must be properly distributed to the mesoscale grid. Existing parameterizations use the single-column method. However, this method can easily lead to the errors of the spatial distribution of the sink and source, thereby impacting the accuracy of mesoscale flow simulations. To this end, we propose a multi-column spatial distribution method based on the Gaussian function. This method distributes the sink and source to multiple vertical grid columns based on the grid weights, which are analytically determined by integrating the two-dimensional Gaussian function over the mesoscale grid. We have applied this method to the classic Fitch model, proposed the improved Fitch-Gaussian model, and integrated it into the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model. Using high-fidelity large eddy simulation as a benchmark, we compared the performance of the proposed method with the single-column method. The results show that the proposed method captures the spatial distribution of the sink and source more accurately, with a higher correlation coefficient and lower normalized root mean square error. Furthermore, the Fitch-Gaussian model better captures the overall spatial distribution patterns of velocity deficit and added TKE. Therefore, the proposed method is recommended for future mesoscale wind farm simulations, especially when the influence of the wind turbine rotor spans multiple mesoscale grid columns.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11392","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.677941","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicsao-ph","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Bowen Du, Qi Li, Mingwei Ge, Xintao Li, Yongqian Liu","raw_content_length":1698,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TKE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1697,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A novel spatial distribution method","wind farm parameterizations","the Gaussian function","arXiv251011392v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Wind farm parameterizations","the wind-farm atmosphere interaction","wind turbines","elevated momentum sinks","sources"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["wind turbines"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A novel spatial distribution method":2.0,"wind farm parameterizations":2.0,"the Gaussian function":2.0,"arXiv251011392v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Wind farm parameterizations":1.0,"the wind-farm atmosphere interaction":1.0,"wind turbines":1.0,"elevated momentum sinks":1.0,"sources":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7749829727777775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8497,"joy":0.0181,"surprise":0.0744,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0184,"anger":0.0248,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":6,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":4,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article presents a novel method for wind farm parameterization, improving the accuracy of mesoscale flow simulations.

Each session has a bespoke schedule created, optimised for the particular time period and the station network that is available during it. Due to various factors, whether it be station outages, sensitivity issues or source effects, not all scheduled observations are available, or of sufficient quality, to be included in the final geodetic analysis. In this paper we derive statistics about the number of missing observations, as well as their effect on the expected precision of geodetic parameters such as station positions and Earth Orientation Parameters. We investigate the impact of observation loss on the weekly rapid turnaround IVS-R1 and IVS-R4 geodetic VLBI sessions over a decade period from 2014 - 2023. Across our 1030 sessions we find on average 25.3\\% of observations scheduled do not make it to analysis.

We find that the estimation of X/Y nutation is particularly robust to typical observation loss seen from these 24-hour sessions. Conversely, we see high-rates of critical degradation in performance (a doubling of the scheduled repeatability) for other geodetic parameters at observations losses of between 15 - 19%, which is less than the median loss of 25.3% that we find across this 10-year period.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11436","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.684049","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physicsgeo-ph","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":243,"author":"Tiege McCarthy, Lucia McCallum","raw_content_length":1596,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.215,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Earth Orientation Parameters","IVS-R1","VLBI","IVS"],"persons":[],"locations":["Earth"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1595,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The impact","observation losses","IVS","arXiv251011436v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Global VLBI observations","Earth orientation","station positions","24-hour sessions","Each session"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The impact":2.0,"observation losses":2.0,"IVS":2.0,"arXiv251011436v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Global VLBI observations":1.0,"Earth orientation":1.0,"station positions":1.0,"24-hour sessions":1.0,"Each session":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7750129194444444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.25,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.25,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8945,"joy":0.0059,"surprise":0.0527,"sadness":0.0248,"fear":0.0063,"anger":0.0109,"disgust":0.005},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"impact_measurement","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":6,"systemic_impact":5,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":5,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":true},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article analyzes the impact of observation losses on geodetic parameters derived from VLBI sessions.

The most common method for atom reconfiguration using optical tweezers relies on frequency chirping of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs). However, chirp-induced acoustic lensing limits the speed of atom transport by deformation of the tweezer profile and warping of the tweezer trajectory. We use a three-dimensional acousto-optic deflector lens (3D-AODL) to mitigate both effects, a design predicted to halve current state-of-the-art long-range transport times. Additionally, we introduce fading-Shepard waveforms that bypass the finite AOD bandwidth and thus enable sustained axial displacement. We demonstrate unrestricted 3D motion within a cuboid volume of at least 200 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 200 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 136 $\\mu$m, with tweezer velocities exceeding 4.2 m/s. The ability to move optical tweezers along arbitrary trajectories in 3D should enable rapid in-plane and out-of-plane rearrangement of atoms in 2D or 3D tweezer arrays and optical lattices, as well as omnidirectional trajectories and dynamical engineering of optical potentials. This technology has the potential to advance quantum control and atom manipulation in current atom-array quantum computers, boosting clock rates and enabling rapid sorting in geometries scalable to millions of qubits.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11451","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.684501","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","physicsatom-ph","physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Yue-Hui Lu, Nathan Song, Tai Xiang, Jacquelyn Ho, Tsai-Chen Lee, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M.

These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties.

The metasurface comprises silicon-rich nitride meta-atoms periodically arrayed in a subdiffractive lattice and overlaid with MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$, which provides optically-pumped gain around $1130~\\mathrm{nm}$. Light emission is enabled by exploiting a quasi-bound state in the continuum in the form of a perturbed vertical magnetic dipole resonance. Following a meticulous design process guided by full-wave simulations and multipole expansion analysis, an ultralow lasing threshold of $\\sim 6~\\mathrm{kW/cm^2}$ is achieved. Moreover, the thermal stability of the lasing structure is examined through heat transfer simulations; stable operation with pump power densities up to a few MW/cm$^2$ (three orders of magnitude above the threshold) is predicted. These results demonstrate that MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$-based metasurface lasers can exhibit robust operation, paving the way for highly-performing ultrathin light-emitting surfaces. The lasing response is rigorously assessed through a highly-efficient temporal coupled-mode theory framework, verified by time-domain FEM simulations showing excellent agreement.

The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\\pm$90$^{\\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\\sim$200 MBq to $\\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements.

In the thermal infrared domain, where radiation follows Planck's law, the self-emission of materials reveals intrinsic properties and internal degradation. By contrast, in the near-infrared range, external illumination enhances surface details and pigment differentiation. Far-infrared and terahertz techniques, operating in both transmission and reflection modes, provide complementary insights by penetrating surface layers to uncover subsurface structures and concealed features. Integrating visible and infrared imaging further enriches diagnostic capabilities by correlating conventional visual assessments with spectral information. Beyond reviewing the wide applications of these NII techniques in cultural heritage research, this work also summarizes recent advances in signal processing, encompassing both hardware and software developments. In particular, deep learning has revolutionized the field by enabling automated classification, feature extraction, defect detection, and super-resolution imaging. Through supervised and unsupervised learning strategies, neural networks can reliably identify subtle anomalies and material variations indicative of past restorations or early stages of deterioration. In conclusion, the convergence of advanced spectral imaging, sophisticated signal processing, and deep neural networks offers a transformative pathway toward more accurate, efficient, and data-driven cultural heritage analysis, ultimately supporting more informed conservation and restoration decisions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11521","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.686665","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":220,"author":"Pengfei Zhu, Hai Zhang, Stefano Sfarra, Dazhi Yang, Xavier Maldague","raw_content_length":1787,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.1,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["NII"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1786,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A review","cultural heritage inspection","mid","arXiv251011521v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","This review","non-invasive imaging NII methods","the terahertz spectral regions","the detection","analysis"],"filter_categories":{"business_innovation":["analysis"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A review":2.0,"cultural heritage inspection":2.0,"mid":2.0,"arXiv251011521v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"This review":1.0,"non-invasive imaging NII methods":1.0,"the terahertz spectral regions":1.0,"the detection":1.0,"analysis":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775124816111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3665000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5267,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8474,"joy":0.0217,"surprise":0.079,"sadness":0.0083,"fear":0.0166,"anger":0.0136,"disgust":0.0134},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article reviews non-invasive imaging techniques for cultural heritage analysis, focusing on advancements in signal processing and deep learning.

By combining steady-state and transient PL with contactless transient surface photovoltage measurements we disentangle the intertwined processes of extraction and recombination, clarifying the physical origin of this phenomenon. This joint approach reveals extraction dynamics not captured by PL alone. A digital replica of the interface shows that Coulomb attraction and interfacial recombination are the fundamental mechanisms driving quenching after charge extraction. Based on these insights, we present a decision tree for heterojunction classification and PL interpretation applicable across diverse optoelectronic systems, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs.

Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements.

For example, a single 6-rod RodOri unit can easily access 11 distinct configurations, far exceeding the reconfigurability of conventional origami or general mechanical reconfigurable systems. Individual rods, constrained under clamped boundary conditions, undergo snapping transitions between discrete morphologies whose strain energy and stiffness are precisely prescribed by their natural curvature. Assembling these rods into modular multi-rod architectures yields metamaterials with numerous stable configurations that can be selectively and reversibly programmed. This configurational diversity enables tunable static stiffness, nonlinear force response, and thus enables tunable dynamic behaviors such as vibration filtering, wave-propagation switching, and mode conversion within a single, easily-manufactured platform.

Among these advancements, the Timepix3 hybrid-pixel direct electron detector stands out for its unique ability to output temporal information about individual hits within its pixel array. Its event-based architecture enables data-driven detection, where individual events are immediately read out from the chip. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of event-based detectors in various applications in the context of continuous-gun scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), the use of such detectors with standard scanning units remains underdeveloped. In this work, we present a custom-designed, Timepix3-compatible scanning unit specifically developed to leverage the advantages of event-based detection.

Accessing this time scale requires precisely synchronised oscillators. In free-electron X-ray lasers, which also provide sub-atomic resolution, synchronisation must be achieved across hundreds of meters. Current approaches to synchronisation based on mode-locked lasers deliver this level of performance but complexity, cost and size hinder their deployment in facility-wide multi-node networks. Here, we demonstrate attosecond-level synchronisation of two chip-integrated photonic oscillators (microcombs) separated by 100 m of fibre. A pair of continuous-wave lasers establishes a time reference that is delivered over fibre, and on-chip Kerr-nonlinear synchronisation results in an integrated relative timing jitter of the microcombs below 400 as (1 kHz to 1 MHz), without any active stabilisation. These results unlock precision timing at scale for large facilities and next-generation technologies such as disaggregated computing and quantum networks, and ultimately may lead to chip-integrated attosecond photonics.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11630","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.694846","language":"en","tags":["preprints","research","physics","physicsoptics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":155,"author":"Alexander E.

By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_ab59416df816","title":"Ensemble","content":"arXiv:2510.09703v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: High-fidelity simulations are essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of materials under high-velocity impact (HVI) in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, their accuracy relies on material models and parameters that are traditionally obtained through manual fitting to multiple time- and labor-intensive experiments. This study presents an ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) framework to automatically and simultaneously calibrate plasticity, fracture, and equation of state (EOS) parameters from a single HVI test. The framework integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for HVI simulations, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for parameter refinement, and adaptive covariance inflation to mitigate uncertainty underestimation. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic back-face deflection data from an AZ31B magnesium plate to identify Johnson-Cook plasticity/fracture and Mie-Gruneisen EOS parameters. Test cases with biased initial guesses and limited data show the EnKF-based framework accurately recovers sensitive parameters in few iterations, indicated by a convergent ensemble standard deviation. Conversely, insensitive parameters converge to incorrect values with persistently large standard deviations. Limited observational data can still achieve convergence but requires more iterations. Under extreme prior bias, sensitive parameters may exhibit a drift-then-stall behavior with small residual biases. In practice, the ensemble standard deviation thus provides a diagnostic tool to assess parameter sensitivity and calibration accuracy. This study demonstrates the proposed DA framework is a robust and efficient tool for HVI material model characterization.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09703","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.698252","language":"en","tags":["preprints","physicsdata-an","research","physics","cond-matmtrl-sci","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":225,"author":"Rong Jin, Guangyao Wang, Xingsheng Sun","raw_content_length":1774,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.125,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Johnson-Cook","EnKF","EOS"],"persons":["Announce Type"],"locations":["Kalman"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1773,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["arXiv251009703v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","High-fidelity simulations","understanding","the behavior","materials","high-velocity impact","HVI","both fundamental research"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["both fundamental research"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"arXiv251009703v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"High-fidelity simulations":1.0,"understanding":1.0,"the behavior":1.0,"materials":1.0,"high-velocity impact":1.0,"HVI":1.0,"both fundamental research":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775343659722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9074,"joy":0.0169,"surprise":0.0197,"sadness":0.0038,"fear":0.024,"anger":0.0196,"disgust":0.0086},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":4,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a data assimilation framework for calibrating material models used in high-velocity impact simulations.

In interstellar and circumstellar environments benzene and other small aromatics are considered the precursor for more complex prebiotic molecules and they have shown to potentially have rich ice-phase photochemistry. The availability of small organic molecules in prebiotic networks depends on their photostability in astrophysical environments preceding planet formation, particularly during the protoplanetary disk stage, as the disk composition is linked to the chemical make-up of planets and planetesimals. We study the ultraviolet (UV) photodestruction (120-160 nm) of five aromatic molecules in undiluted ices and, for selected cases, in astrophysically relevant ice matrices (H2O, CO, CO2). For each ice, we measure the destruction cross sections as a function of photon exposure. In undiluted ices, aromatic molecules exhibit substantially lower photodestruction cross sections (sigma < 10-19 cm2) than aliphatic hydrocarbons, including cyclohexane, (sigma = 2.8-4x10-18 cm2). Furthermore, neither substituent nature nor size affects the aromatic stability in pure ices, suggesting that the strong intermolecular interactions among aromatic molecules provide protection against VUV exposure, even with small to mid-sized ring substituents. In mixed ices, the photodestruction and reactivity of aromatic molecules (sigma = 2.5-6.1x10-18 cm2) increases by more than an order of magnitude, but are still lower than in the gas-phase. We attribute this to a weaker cage effect and matrix-specific interactions. We use the experimental photodestruction cross sections to estimate the lifetime of aromatic molecules in protoplanetary disks, denileating the disks regions in which aromatic photochemistry is expected to be the most active.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09797","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.704316","language":"en","tags":["astro-phep","preprints","physicschem-ph","research","astro-phim","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":255,"author":"Elettra L.

These disentangled low-dimensional representations are observed in multiple brain areas and across different species, and are typically the result of a process of abstraction that supports simple forms of out-of-distribution generalization. The mechanisms by which such geometries emerge remain poorly understood, and the mechanisms that have been investigated are typically unsupervised (e.g., based on variational auto-encoders). Here, we show mathematically that abstract representations of latent variables are guaranteed to appear in the last hidden layer of feedforward nonlinear networks when they are trained on tasks that depend directly on these latent variables. These abstract representations reflect the structure of the desired outputs or the semantics of the input stimuli. To investigate the neural representations that emerge in these networks, we develop an analytical framework that maps the optimization over the network weights into a mean-field problem over the distribution of neural preactivations. Applying this framework to a finite-width ReLU network, we find that its hidden layer exhibits an abstract representation at all global minima of the task objective.

However, the current understanding of the nature of turbulent magnetic reconnection remains insufficient. We investigate the statistical properties of reconnection turbulence in the framework of the self-driven reconnection. Using the open-source software package AMUN, we first perform numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection. We then obtain the statistical results of reconnection turbulence by traditional statistical methods such as the power spectrum and structure function. Our numerical results demonstrate: (1) the velocity spectrum of reconnection turbulence follows the classical Kolmogorov type of $E\\propto k^{-5/3}$, while the magnetic field spectrum is steeper than the Kolmogorov spectrum, which are independent of limited resistivity, guide field, and isothermal or adiabatic fluid states; (2) most of the simulations show the anisotropy cascade, except that the presence of a guide field leads to an isotropic cascade; (3) reconnection turbulence is incompressible in the adiabatic state, with energy distribution dominated by the velocity solenoidal component; (4) different from pure magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, the intermittency of the velocity field is stronger than that of the magnetic field in reconnection turbulence. The steep magnetic field spectrum, together with the velocity spectrum of Kolmogorov type, can characterize the feature of the reconnection turbulence. In the case of the presence of the guide field, the isotropy of the reconnection turbulence cascade is also different from the cascade mode of pure MHD turbulence. Our experimental results provide new insights into the properties of reconnection turbulence, which will contribute to advancing the self-driven reconnection theory.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09978","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.707095","language":"en","tags":["physicsplasm-ph","astro-phhe","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":261,"author":"Shi-Min Liang, Jian-Fu Zhang, Na-Na Gao, Nian-Yu Yi","raw_content_length":1928,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.305,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["AMUN"],"persons":["Kolmogorov"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1927,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the properties","reconnection","arXiv251009978v1 Announce Type","cross","Magnetic reconnection","turbulence interaction","a ubiquitous phenomenon","astrophysical environments","the current understanding","the nature"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the properties":2.0,"reconnection":2.0,"arXiv251009978v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Magnetic reconnection":1.0,"turbulence interaction":1.0,"a ubiquitous phenomenon":1.0,"astrophysical environments":1.0,"the current understanding":1.0,"the nature":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7754743147222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.6014,"joy":0.0456,"surprise":0.0641,"sadness":0.0089,"fear":0.222,"anger":0.0423,"disgust":0.0157},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents numerical simulations of turbulent magnetic reconnection using the AMUN software package.

The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10070","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.708455","language":"en","tags":["physicscomp-ph","preprints","math-ph","mathmp","research","astro-phim","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":275,"author":"S.

This framework offers a systematic approach to investigate how network topology and choice mechanisms jointly shape percolation behavior. We analyze the effects of the degree exponent $\\omega$ and the choice parameter $M$ on the critical point $t_c$ and the critical exponents ($\\beta,\\alpha,\\gamma$), which define universality classes and obey the Rushbrooke inequality $\\alpha + 2\\beta + \\gamma \\geq 2$. Using entropy, the order parameter, and their derivatives (representing specific heat and susceptibility respectively), we show that both $t_c$ and the universality class depend only weakly on $\\omega$ but strongly on $M$, while the Rushbrooke inequality remains valid throughout. For $M=2$, the order parameter varies continuously without a clear order-disorder transition. By contrast, $M=3$ and $M=4$ display explosive percolation that still corresponds to a continuous phase transition, with $M=4$ producing a significantly sharper and clearer order-disorder transition.

Between two checks, a trajectory may leave and re-enter the domain without being detected. Under this \\emph{stroboscopic} rule (``kill-on-check''), exit statistics change qualitatively.

The dynamics collapse onto a single confinement ratio $\\rho=L/(\\sigma\\sqrt{\\Delta t})$. For boundary starts we obtain linear scaling of the mean number of frames until exit, while for bulk starts the survival is governed by the spectral gap of a one-step stroboscopic operator, leading to a quadratic law with linear corrections.

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_fde38a1de5fa","title":"Atomic","content":"arXiv:2510.10326v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Amorphous boron nitride (\\textrm{$\\alpha$}-BN) is a promising ultrathin barrier for nanoelectronics, yet the atomistic mechanisms governing its chemical stability remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the structure-property relationship that dictates the oxidation of \\textrm{$\\alpha$}-BN using a combination of machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The simulations reveal that the film structure, controlled by synthesis conditions, is the critical factor determining oxidation resistance. Dense, chemically ordered networks with a high fraction of B-N bonds effectively resist oxidation by confining it to the surface, whereas porous, defect-rich structures with abundant homonuclear B-B and N-N bonds permit oxygen penetration and undergo extensive bulk degradation. These computational findings are consistent with experimental trends observed in \\textrm{$\\alpha$}-BN films grown by chemical vapour deposition. XPS analysis shows that a film grown at a higher temperature develops a more ordered structure with a B/N ratio nearer to stoichiometric and exhibits superior resistance to surface oxidation compared to its more defective, lower-temperature counterpart.

Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10345","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.712391","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","physicscomp-ph","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"Elijah Pelofske","raw_content_length":1274,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz","QAOA","Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm"],"persons":["Ansatz","Boltzmann"],"locations":["Gibbs"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1273,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz","an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler","QAOA","arXiv251010345v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","This study","the thermal sampling properties","the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz","which"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["This study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz":2.0,"an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler":2.0,"QAOA":2.0,"arXiv251010345v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"This study":1.0,"the thermal sampling properties":1.0,"the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7755937877777774,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8498,"joy":0.0301,"surprise":0.0886,"sadness":0.0054,"fear":0.0071,"anger":0.0116,"disgust":0.0074},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":3,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":6,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper explores the potential of QAOA for thermal sampling, which could indirectly contribute to sustainability by optimizing energy-intensive processes.

However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10352","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.713346","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","cond-matsoft","physicsbio-ph","preprints","cond-matstat-mech","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":179,"author":"Amaresh Sahu","raw_content_length":1265,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.895,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Announce Type: cross"],"persons":["fluid drag"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1264,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Osmotic forces","lipid membrane fluctuations","arXiv251010352v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","hydrodynamic descriptions","lipid bilayers","the membrane","the surrounding solute-containing fluid","biological and in vitro lipid membranes"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["the surrounding solute-containing fluid"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Osmotic forces":2.0,"lipid membrane fluctuations":2.0,"arXiv251010352v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"hydrodynamic descriptions":1.0,"lipid bilayers":1.0,"the membrane":1.0,"the surrounding solute-containing fluid":1.0,"biological and in vitro lipid membranes":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775608923333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.997000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5994,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8254,"joy":0.0102,"surprise":0.0553,"sadness":0.0117,"fear":0.028,"anger":0.0277,"disgust":0.0418},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research on lipid membrane dynamics, which could potentially inform the development of more efficient membranes for various applications.

The deformity in notches creates non-uniform pinning strength, leading to multiple faults during shift operation. This study proposes a novel approach to address these challenges and gain greater control over domain manipulation for advanced applications in Boolean and non-Boolean paradigms. Utilizing the magnetic topological insulator (MTI) can create pinning sites without potentially faulty topographical notches made through complex lithography. Moreover, applying an external current enables precise control over the pinning potentials at these sites. Micromagnetic simulations validate the effectiveness of MTI-based pinning sites, showcasing their potential for future applications. Our approach introduces an alternative method for creating pinning sites by cross-architecture of ferromagnetic nanowires and MTI nanobars, inducing exchange interaction at their intersection points.

For simplicity, we first take a system with two identical scalar particles as an example. The interaction between these two scalar particles is described by the exchange of another massive scalar meson under the instantaneous approximation, which results in the Yukawa potential. A highly accurate numerical method is used to determine the critical screening mass value of the system. The resulting critical screening mass for the ground state is consistent with those reported in the literature, agreeing to about 30 significant figures. The highly accurate results for the $l=1$ case are also presented, which are significantly more precise than those previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, we extend the discussion to physical hadronic molecule states, where form factors are introduced in the interaction to describe the structure of hadrons. Our numerical results show that although the binding energies of the hadronic molecule states depend on the cutoff in the form factors, the number of hadronic molecule states is almost independent of the cutoffs across a very wide physical region. This indicates a strong and important property: the number of hadronic molecule states is almost solely determined by the coupling constants and the masses of the exchange particles. This highly accurate numerical method can also be straightforwardly applied to higher $l$ cases or other systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10420","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.715313","language":"en","tags":["physicsatom-ph","hep-ph","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":234,"author":"Lin-Qing Song, Hai-Qing Zhou","raw_content_length":1565,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.17,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Yukawa"],"monetary":["$l=1$"]},"char_count":1564,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["bound states","Critical properties","arXiv251010420v1 Announce Type","cross","Abstract","this study","some general critical properties","one-boson-exchange potential","simplicity","a system"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["this study"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"bound states":3.0,"Critical properties":2.0,"arXiv251010420v1 Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"this study":1.0,"some general critical properties":1.0,"one-boson-exchange potential":1.0,"simplicity":1.0,"a system":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775637915,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.213,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5574,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.889,"joy":0.0311,"surprise":0.0615,"sadness":0.0043,"fear":0.0032,"anger":0.0075,"disgust":0.0034},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":8,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":2,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents highly accurate numerical methods for calculating critical screening mass values in particle physics.

In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11350","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.729200","language":"en","tags":["physicscomp-ph","preprints","research","physics","cond-matmtrl-sci","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":185,"author":"\\'A.

The vanishingly low probability of the natural codon-to-amino acid mapping arising by chance has spurred the hypothesis that its structure is a solution optimized for robustness against mutations and translational errors. For the construction of effective molecular machines, the dictionary of encoded amino acids must also be diverse enough in physicochemical features. Here, we examine whether the standard genetic code can be understood as a near-optimal solution balancing these two objectives: minimizing error load and aligning codon assignments with the naturally occurring amino acid composition. Using simulated annealing, we explore this trade-off across a broad range of parameters. We find that the standard genetic code lies near local optima within the multidimensional parameter space. It is a highly effective solution that balances fidelity against resource availability constraints. These results suggest that the present genetic code reflects coevolution under conflicting pressures of fidelity and diversity, offering new insight into its emergence and evolution.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10871","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.721307","language":"en","tags":["q-bioot","preprints","physicsbio-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":172,"author":"Yudam Seo, Tsvi Tlusty, Junghyo Jo","raw_content_length":1235,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.86,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Fidelity and Diversity"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1234,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Interplay","Fidelity","Diversity","the Evolution","the Genetic Code","Announce Type","Abstract","The origin","principles","the genetic code"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Interplay":2.0,"Fidelity":2.0,"Diversity":2.0,"the Evolution":2.0,"the Genetic Code":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"The origin":1.0,"principles":1.0,"the genetic code":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775769795277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.063,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8126,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8513,"joy":0.0291,"surprise":0.0618,"sadness":0.0063,"fear":0.0334,"anger":0.0126,"disgust":0.0054},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This is theoretical research about the evolution of the genetic code and its optimization for robustness.

However, in practice, the acoustics of the playback room may lead to a noticeable degradation in sound quality. We propose a recording and rendering method based on Ambisonics that utilizes a perceptually-motivated approach to compensate for the reverberation of the playback room. The recorded direct and reverberant sound field components in the spherical harmonics (SHs) domain are spectrally and spatially compensated to preserve the relevant auditory cues including the direction of arrival of the direct sound, the spectral energy of the direct and reverberant sound components, and the Interaural Coherence (IC) across each auditory band. In contrast to the conventional Ambisonics, a flexible number of Ambisonics channels can be used for audio rendering. Listening test results show that the proposed method provides a perceptually accurate rendering of the originally recorded sound field, outperforming both conventional Ambisonics without compensation and even ideal Ambisonics rendering in a simulated anechoic room. Additionally, subjective evaluations of listeners seated at the center of the loudspeaker array demonstrate that the method remains robust to head rotation and minor displacements.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10883","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.721985","language":"en","tags":["physicsapp-ph","eessas","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Ali Fallah, Shun Nakamura, Steven van de Par","raw_content_length":1437,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.025,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["the Interaural Coherence","Ambisonics"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1436,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Perceptual Compensation","Ambisonics Recordings","Reproduction","Room","Ambisonics","the acoustics","the playback room","Announce Type","cross","a method"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Perceptual Compensation":2.0,"Ambisonics Recordings":2.0,"Reproduction":2.0,"Room":2.0,"Ambisonics":2.0,"the acoustics":2.0,"the playback room":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"a method":1.0}},"age_hours":2.775784352777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":2.3665000000000003,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.5267,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9108,"joy":0.0149,"surprise":0.0243,"sadness":0.0071,"fear":0.0102,"anger":0.009,"disgust":0.0237},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"applied_research","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":3,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This paper presents a novel method for improving the perceptual accuracy of Ambisonics recordings in real-world playback environments.

We show that exact transformations arise whenever the adjoint action of a unitary's generator defines a linear map within a finite-dimensional operator space. In this regime, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem ensures the existence of a finite-degree polynomial that annihilates the adjoint map, rendering the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion finite. This perspective brings together previously disparate examples of exact transformations under a single unifying principle and clarifies how algebraic relations between generators and transformed operators determine the polynomial degree of the transformation. We illustrate this framework for unitary coupled-cluster and involutory generators, identifying cases in which a single commutator suffices. The result establishes clear algebraic criteria for when exact unitary transformations are possible and provides new strategies for reducing their computational cost in quantum simulation.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10957","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.722645","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","preprints","physicschem-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":158,"author":"Praveen Jayakumar, Tao Zeng, Artur F.

In this review, we examine recent advances in quantum optical circuits with spatially structured light, focusing particularly on top-down approaches that employ complex mode-mixing transformations in free-space and fibers. In this context, we highlight circuits based on platforms such as multi-plane light conversion, complex scattering media, multimode and multi-core fibers. We discuss their applications for the manipulation and measurement of multi-dimensional and multi-mode quantum states. Furthermore, we discuss how these circuits have been employed to perform multi-party operations and multi-outcome measurements, thereby opening new avenues for scalable photonic quantum information processing.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11154","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.725242","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":154,"author":"Suraj Goel, Bohnishikha Ghosh, Mehul Malik","raw_content_length":1178,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Quantum Information Processing with Spatially Structured Light arXiv:2510.11154v1"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1177,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Quantum Information Processing","Spatially Structured Light","quantum information processing","arXiv251011154v1","Announce Type","cross","Qudits","a powerful resource","enhanced channel capacities","robustness"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Quantum Information Processing":2.0,"Spatially Structured Light":2.0,"quantum information processing":2.0,"arXiv251011154v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Qudits":1.0,"a powerful resource":1.0,"enhanced channel capacities":1.0,"robustness":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7758533069444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.608,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9216,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8684,"joy":0.0387,"surprise":0.0668,"sadness":0.0042,"fear":0.0062,"anger":0.0093,"disgust":0.0062},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":6,"economic_viability":2,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":6,"evidence_strength":5,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article discusses advances in quantum information processing using spatially structured light.

Statistical analysis of 100 jets (50 inside jets and 50 outside jets) reveals that inside jets have a projected velocity range of 4--14~km\\,s$^{-1}$, a length range of 1--4~Mm, a width range of 0.2--0.6~Mm, and a lifetime range of 135--450~s, with mean values of 7.90~km\\,s$^{-1}$, 2.61~Mm, 0.41~Mm, and 260~s, respectively. About 52\\% of inside jets are associated with brightenings in H$\\alpha$ blue wing images, and some show high-temperature signatures, suggesting a connection with localized energy release. In contrast, outside jets have higher velocities (8--50~km\\,s$^{-1}$, average 19.04~km\\,s$^{-1}$), greater lengths (average 6.26~Mm, up to 27.27~Mm), slightly larger widths (average 0.46~Mm), and longer lifetimes (135--630~s, average 327~s). They typically originate from regions of opposite magnetic polarities and are associated with magnetic flux emergence and EUV brightenings.

I give special attention to certain disagreements between QBism and LBF identified French's work, as well as French's related claims that QBism may be at odds with key ideas in phenomenology. My main finding is that QBism does not fare so badly with phenomenology as French makes out; in particular it can be made compatible with Zahavi's correlationism and Husserl's notion of intersubjectivity, both of which strongly inform LBF.

SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\\%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and position of bubbles, we demonstrate a~mask-based method that enables deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters, providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11610","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.734275","language":"en","tags":["physicsoptics","preprints","research","physics","cond-matmtrl-sci","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":192,"author":"Piotr Tatarczak, Tomasz F\\k{a}s, Jan Paw{\\l}owski, Aleksandra Krystyna D\\k{a}browska, Jan Suffczy\\'nski, Piotr Wr\\'obel, Andrzej Wysmo{\\l}ek, Johannes Binder","raw_content_length":1463,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.96,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["MOVPE)-grown hBN"],"persons":["Announce Type:"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1462,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["studies","Deterministic hBN bubbles","a versatile platform","SPEs","arXiv251011610v1","Announce Type","cross","Abstract","Single-photon emitters","two-dimensional materials"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"studies":3.0,"Deterministic hBN bubbles":2.0,"a versatile platform":2.0,"SPEs":2.0,"arXiv251011610v1":1.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"cross":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"Single-photon emitters":1.0,"two-dimensional materials":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7760592969444446,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.2314999999999998,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7537,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8528,"joy":0.0165,"surprise":0.0094,"sadness":0.0068,"fear":0.0446,"anger":0.0376,"disgust":0.0323},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":3,"deployment_readiness":2,"systemic_impact":3,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":true,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes research on a new platform for studying single-photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride.

However, the error analysis of product formulas is challenging, and their cost is often overestimated. It is established that Trotter error can be bounded in terms of spectral norms of nested commutators of the Hamiltonian partitions [Childs et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011020], but evaluating these expressions is challenging, often achieved by repeated application of the triangle inequality, significantly loosening the bound. Here, we show that the spectral norm of an operator can be upper bounded by the spectral norm of an equivalent sign-problem-free operator, which can be calculated efficiently to large system sizes using projector Monte Carlo simulation. For a range of Hamiltonians and considering second-order formulas, we demonstrate that this Monte Carlo-based bound is often extremely tight, and even exact in some instances. For the uniform electron gas we reduce the cost of performing Trotterization from the literature by an order of magnitude. For the Pariser-Parr-Pople model for linear acene molecules, which has $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ long-range interaction terms, we show that it suffices to use $\\mathcal{O}(N^{0.57})$ Trotter steps and circuit depth $\\mathcal{O}(N^{1.57})$ to implement Hamiltonian simulation.

Constructions with canonical self-interacting scalars in asymptotically flat spacetimes and inverse reconstruction schemes do exist, but they rarely produce a fully closed-form potential that smoothly matches a de Sitter core to a Schwarzschild-(A)dS exterior. Here we present a fully analytic, static, spherically symmetric solution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system with a minimally coupled canonical scalar. Working in a two-function metric gauge and adopting a simple monotone kink profile that interpolates between two vacuum energies, we reconstruct the scalar potential directly from the field equations; for zero mass parameter it reduces to a quintic polynomial in a natural interpolation variable. The resulting configuration is everywhere regular, fixes the redshift algebraically, requires neither thin shells nor modified gravity, and realizes a de Sitter core matched to a Schwarzschild-(A)dS exterior with explicitly characterizable horizons. This compact closed-form model furnishes a convenient analytic benchmark for studies of horizon structure, thermodynamics, stability, and AdS applications within a canonical matter sector.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02078","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.735599","language":"en","tags":["physicsgen-ph","research","preprints","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":188,"author":"Thomas Sch\\\"urmann","raw_content_length":1412,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.94,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["de Sitter"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1411,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Closed-Form Canonical","arXiv200102078v4 Announce Type","Regular non-singular black holes","de Sitter cores","effective mass functions","anisotropic vacuum fluids","phantom scalars","energy conditions","Constructions","canonical self-interacting scalars"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Closed-Form Canonical":2.0,"arXiv200102078v4 Announce Type":1.0,"Regular non-singular black holes":1.0,"de Sitter cores":1.0,"effective mass functions":1.0,"anisotropic vacuum fluids":1.0,"phantom scalars":1.0,"energy conditions":1.0,"Constructions":1.0,"canonical self-interacting scalars":1.0}},"age_hours":2.776089952777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.640000000000001,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.128,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8982,"joy":0.0043,"surprise":0.0213,"sadness":0.0066,"fear":0.0221,"anger":0.0247,"disgust":0.0227},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"breakthrough_research","innovation_stage":"basic_research","climate_impact_potential":2,"technical_credibility":7,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":3,"innovation_quality":7,"evidence_strength":7,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":true,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":true,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article presents a theoretical, fully analytic solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system.

To partially describe the effects of anharmonicity, important in the spectra of real molecules, we describe a combination of the Hagedorn wavepacket approach to SVL spectroscopy with the local harmonic approximation. In a proof-of-principle study [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010801 (2025)], we successfully demonstrated the utility of this method by computing the SVL spectra of difluorocarbene, a floppy molecule with moderately anharmonic potential. Here, we describe the theory in detail and analyse the method more thoroughly. To assess the accuracy of the method independently of electronic structure errors, we use a two-dimensional Morse-type potential for which exact quantum benchmarks are available, and show that the local harmonic approach yields more accurate results than global harmonic approximations, especially for the emission spectra from higher initial vibrational levels. Next, we compare the global and local harmonic SVL spectra of anthracene, where the more expensive local harmonic corrections turn out to be less important as long as the correct global harmonic model is used. We also present additional local harmonic results for difluorocarbene, where treating anharmonicity is essential for accurate evaluation of the spectra. Yet, we also show that the structure of the difluorocarbene spectra can be explained qualitatively (but not quantitatively) with a reduced-dimensional harmonic model, for which the spectral intensities can be evaluated analytically.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11991","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.739387","language":"en","tags":["quant-ph","preprints","physicschem-ph","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":233,"author":"Zhan Tong Zhang, M\\'at\\'e Visegr\\'adi, Ji\\v{r}\\'i J.

A climate emergency has been declared yet policies and emission reductions continue to fail. Global temperature anomalies in recent years have not been modelled well. Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years), and a perturbation lifetime of 11.8 $\\pm$ 1.8 yrs (IPCC AR6). It has a high, short-term impact on global warming: substantially greater than CO2. Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure the short-term, negative climatic effects of CH4, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses. This study examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing the true, immediate climate impact of CH4 and its inability to incorporate varying emissions, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the multi-faceted implications of this under-reporting of CH4 emissions. Recalculation of 2024 Emissions Gap Report using a ten-year GWP of 105 increased CH4's warming effect to almost 90% of CO2, rather than 25% using a GWP100 of 28. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate time horizon for CH4's warming effects, accelerating climate emergency action, while recognizing the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of CH4 emissions on reduction efforts. To overcome the limitations of GWP100, a static constant, we propose GWPEFF(t) which dynamically represents warming across various time periods.
