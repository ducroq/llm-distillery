{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_07d417c423fb","title":"Herfstvakantie met rustig weer, weinig zon maar ook weinig regen","content":"Het weer in Nederland is op dit moment erg rustig. Weinig wind, weinig regen, maar ook heel weinig zon. De komende week, waarin de scholen in het zuiden herfstvakantie hebben, blijft die weerssituatie bijna onveranderd. Dat grijze weer wordt veroorzaakt door een groot hogedrukgebied in de buurt van ons land. In de zomer geeft een hogedrukgebied bijna gegarandeerd zonnig weer. Maar in de herfst en de winter kan het juist ook heel grijs weer opleveren. Dat zit zo: in een hogedrukgebied daalt de lucht langzaam van grote hoogte naar beneden. Daarbij warmt de lucht op, en in de zomer zorgt het ervoor dat er nauwelijks wolken kunnen ontstaan door opstijgende vochtige lucht. Daardoor staat in de zomer een hogedrukgebied bijna garant voor zonnig weer. Hogedrukgebied Maar in de herfst en de winter, als de zon zwak is en de zee nog behoorlijk warm, verdampt er veel water en ontstaan er wolken. Die raken dan gevangen in een dunne laag tussen het aardoppervlak en de dalende lucht van het hogedrukgebied. Die grijze wolkenlaag kan dan met weinig wind heel lang blijven hangen. De zon is ook te zwak om de bewolking te laten oplossen. De komende dagen blijft er een hogedrukgebied iets ten noorden van ons land liggen. De wind komt bij ons de komende dagen uit het noorden, vanaf de Noordzee. Daardoor blijft er de hele tijd bewolking boven ons land drijven. Jammer voor als je van zon houdt, maar aan de andere kant valt er ook nauwelijks regen. Het is ook bepaald niet koud, met overdag een temperatuur van 15 tot 17 graden. Mocht je deze week op vakantie gaan, dan vind je in de landen om ons heen ook vaak bewolking. Maar de zon is niet heel ver weg. In Berlijn en Londen moet je het weliswaar met de bewolking doen die we hier in Nederland ook hebben. Nochtans schijnt in Parijs regelmatig de zon.

De vrouw, die nog spoorloos is, wordt als drukmiddel ingezet, zegt de politie die daar verder niet over uitweidt. Rechercheurs uit andere landen zijn betrokken bij het onderzoek naar de ontvoering van de vrouw. De politie heeft niet bekendgemaakt welke landen het zijn. Meerdere aanhoudingen De afgelopen dagen zijn zes mannen aangehouden voor betrokkenheid bij de ontvoering: een 29-jarige man uit het Belgische Beersel, twee 37-jarigen uit Almere en drie mannen van 17, 20 en 24 jaar uit Rotterdam en Amsterdam.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_606855ba75fa","title":"Kameroen kiest president, Paul Biya (92) maakt kans op achtste termijn","content":"De 92-jarige Paul Biya, 's werelds oudste president, staat vandaag opnieuw op het stembiljet. Als hij wordt herkozen en hij blijft in leven, is hij bijna 100 jaar als zijn ambtstermijn erop zit. Biya is al ruim veertig jaar aan de macht het centraal-Afrikaanse land. Hij neemt het in de verkiezingen op tegen elf kandidaten van de oppositie. Verwacht wordt dat Biya de verkiezingen wint. De vorige keren dat hij werd gekozen, speelden een lage opkomst en de angst van minderheden om te gaan stemmen een belangrijke rol bij de uitkomst. Een van de andere kandidaten is Issa Tchiroma Bakary (79), oud-woordvoerder van Biya. Op zijn campagnebijeenkomsten, waar hij kritiek uitte op de vele jaren dat Biya aan de macht is, trok hij massaal publiek. Maandenlang was het nog maar de vraag of Biya zich opnieuw verkiesbaar zou stellen. Hij is vaak ziek of in het buitenland. Het regeren laat hij dan over aan partijfunctionarissen of familieleden. De opkomst zal in deze verkiezingen een doorslaggevende rol spelen, omdat er twee miljoen nieuwe geregistreerde kiezers zijn aangemeld sinds de vorige verkiezingen. De laatste jaren is er meer onrust in Kameroen. Het land kent een Franstalige meerderheid, Engelstalige separatisten boycotten de verkiezingen. Ook kampt het land met ernstige armoede. Bijna de helft van de bevolking leeft van minder dan 2 dollar per dag. Biya is pas de tweede president van Kameroen sinds het land in 1960 onafhankelijk werd van Frankrijk. De uitslag van de verkiezingen wordt naar verwachting binnen twee weken bekendgemaakt.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586196","published_date":"2025-10-12T14:11:34","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:32:22.908677","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":250,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1804,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.25,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Tchiroma Bakary"],"persons":["Paul Biya","Maandenlang"],"locations":["Verwacht","Biya"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1550,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["hij","president","kans","achtste termijn","de verkiezingen","werelds","het stembiljet","leven","bijna 100 jaar","zijn ambtstermijn"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"hij":4.0,"president":2.0,"kans":2.0,"achtste termijn":2.0,"de verkiezingen":2.0,"werelds":1.0,"het stembiljet":1.0,"leven":1.0,"bijna 100 jaar":1.0,"zijn ambtstermijn":1.0}},"age_hours":4.449918687777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.2940000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4588,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7154,"joy":0.0213,"surprise":0.119,"sadness":0.0436,"fear":0.0312,"anger":0.0314,"disgust":0.0381},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":1,"technical_credibility":2,"economic_viability":1,"deployment_readiness":1,"systemic_impact":1,"justice_equity":2,"innovation_quality":1,"evidence_strength":2,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"The article discusses an election in Cameroon.

Mogelijk deed hij dat expres. De man meldde zichzelf bij de politie. Bij de aanrijding raakten twee mannen gewond. Een van hen werd met hoofdletsel naar het ziekenhuis overgebracht, de ander werd door ambulancepersoneel nagekeken. Mogelijk ging er aan de aanrijding een conflict tussen de bestuurder en de slachtoffers vooraf. Toen de bestuurder op de vlucht sloeg heeft hij mogelijk gedreigd met een voorwerp dat lijkt op een vuurwapen, schrijft Omroep Brabant. Onderzoek leidde de politie naar het huis van de verdachte. Daar zagen ze een beschadigde auto staan. De verdachte was er niet, maar die meldde zich later op het politiebureau. Een vrouw die naast hem in de auto had gezeten, werd niet aangehouden. In het huis van de verdachte werd geen vuurwapen gevonden. De politie praat met betrokkenen en getuigen en bekijkt camerabeelden. De auto van de man is in beslag genomen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2586194","published_date":"2025-10-12T13:29:03","collected_date":"2025-10-12T18:32:22.909306","language":"nl","tags":["nederland","mainstream","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":166,"author":null,"raw_content_length":1208,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.83,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Den Bosch","Omroep Brabant"],"persons":[],"locations":["Den Bosch"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1014,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["mensen","die","tankstation","hij","de aanrijding","de bestuurder","Een 22-jarige man","de avond","een tankstation","dat expres"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"mensen":3.0,"die":2.0,"tankstation":2.0,"hij":2.0,"de aanrijding":2.0,"de bestuurder":2.0,"Een 22-jarige man":1.0,"de avond":1.0,"een tankstation":1.0,"dat expres":1.0}},"age_hours":5.158544614722222,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":1.3245,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7351,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5094,"joy":0.0212,"surprise":0.1291,"sadness":0.0703,"fear":0.0706,"anger":0.0817,"disgust":0.1177},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_analysis":{"content_type":"policy_action","innovation_stage":"commercial","climate_impact_potential":0,"technical_credibility":0,"economic_viability":0,"deployment_readiness":0,"systemic_impact":0,"justice_equity":0,"innovation_quality":0,"evidence_strength":0,"investment_signals":{"has_funding":false,"has_patents":false,"has_customers":false,"has_metrics":false,"has_peer_review":false,"has_deployment":false},"verification_indicators":{"owid_indicator":false,"ipcc_alignment":false,"iea_data":false,"third_party_verified":false,"regulatory_approved":false},"flags":{"greenwashing_risk":false,"vaporware_risk":false,"fossil_transition":false},"reasoning":"This article describes a crime.
