      weight: 0.15
      description: "MW/GW deployed, units sold, installations (context-aware)"
      scale: |
        0-2: Zero or negligible (<1 MW, <100 units)
        3-4: Small scale (1-10 MW, 100-1000 units) - startup proof-of-concept
        5-6: Meaningful (10-100 MW, 1000-10k units) - early commercial
        7-8: Significant (100 MW-1 GW, 10k-100k units) - regional impact
        9-10: Massive (>1 GW, >100k units) - national/global scale
      context_adjustment:
        startup: "+1.5x multiplier (1 MW is significant)"
