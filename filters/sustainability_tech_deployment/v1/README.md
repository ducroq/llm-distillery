# Sustainability Pillar 1: Technology Works Filter

**Version**: 1.0
**Purpose**: Prove that climate solutions are deployed NOW and scaling, not theoretical future promises
**Pillar**: "Technology Actually Works (and is scaling)"
**Oracle Output**: Dimensional scores only (0-10 per dimension). Tier classification is computed post-processing from dimensional scores, not generated by the oracle.

## Overview

This filter evaluates climate technology articles to distinguish deployed, proven technology from vaporware, prototypes, and pure R&D announcements. It supports the narrative that climate solutions exist and are scaling globally.

## Pre-Filter Logic

**Goal**: Block vaporware and lab-only tech before expensive LLM calls.

**Block if article contains**:
- "concept", "theoretical", "could potentially" (without deployment data)
- "prototype unveiled", "demo", "proof-of-concept"
- "laboratory results", "bench-scale", "research published" (without commercialization)
- "plans to deploy", "aiming for", "will build by 2030" (future-only, no current deployment)

**Pass if article contains**:
- "operational", "online", "generating", "producing"
- "deployed", "installed", "commissioned"
- Specific numbers: "X MW", "Y GW", "Z tons CO2", "N units sold"
- "market share", "YoY growth", "capacity factor"
- "cost declined", "LCOE", "price parity"

**Expected pass rate**: ~30-40% (most tech news is vaporware/prototypes)
