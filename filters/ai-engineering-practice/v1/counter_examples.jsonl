Uses dslim/bert-base-NER running entirely on localhost - no cloud inference. Architecture: Frontend: Chrome Extension (intercepts DOM events on paste/enter). Backend: Python FastAPI running locally (defaulting to dslim/bert-base-NER). Privacy: Inference is 100% localhost. No data leaves your machine until you confirm "}
