{"id":"community_social_dev_to_d7ebb68034fe","title":"Evolution of Agentic AI C/O Amazon Quicksuite","content":"Today, whatever is new quickly becomes old. We started with AI, then moved to Generative AI, and now it’s Agentic AI. Honestly, the lines blur because everything overlaps and shines depending on our use cases and requirements. Before diving deeper, it’s also key to clarify the difference between Generative AI and Agentic AI. Generative AI is reactive; it creates content—text, images, code—based on user prompts. It focuses on what to create when asked. In contrast, Agentic AI is proactive and autonomous. It takes initiative, sets goals, plans multi-step workflows, makes decisions, adapts dynamically, and executes tasks with minimum supervision. Generative AI powers content within these systems, but Agentic AI orchestrates entire processes to achieve goals efficiently, turning AI from a passive tool into an active partner driving outcomes. This post gives you a glimpse of the newest addition to AWS’s agentic AI stack—Amazon QuickSuite. The name says it all: Quick — enabling you to build agent flows, create agentic AIs, conduct deep research, dive into your data, or even build your own personal chat agent like your own GPT—all really fast, right at your fingertips. Suite — because it’s a family of tools: Quick Flow, Quick Automate, Quick Agents, Quick Research, and more. QuickSuite is an agentic AI ecosystem delivered as a SaaS offering from AWS. Before this, building agentic AIs with Bedrock agents meant you had to manage model invocations, quotas, Lambda runtimes, observability, security, and more. Now, all that complexity is gone. My QuickSuite Use Cases Automated content generation for sales and marketing AWS assistant for Weekly Updates Resume analyzer with Quick Automate Quick Suite Dashboard Quick Flows It is a no-code/low-code automation feature that lets users create intelligent workflows using natural language prompts. It automates repetitive or routine tasks by turning simple descriptions into fully functioning workflows, connecting data and actions seamlessly across apps without coding Automated content generation for sales and marketing You can how fast i created an agentic ai which handles multiple tasks as below. with just bare minimum prompting thats all . We can also edit it , by going into editor mode and also we can text fields, file upload fields , integrations , UI Agents ,etc. Final Flow Output: AWS assistant for Weekly Updates Mode of Searches are three types one is General Knowledge uses Gen AI , Web search does web browsing and last one is quicksuite data which is skimming through your enterprise data After running my flow here is the output ** Resume Analyser Agent ** Create me a resume analyser where Users uploades files which must be pdf,docx,txt which must 5 files at time. please make sure i can upload 3 files at a time if needed add reasoning flow to that user will enter information like for which role , experince , then provide me recommdations , certifications , weak strong , compare between other profiles resumes . genreate final info we can still improvise it very well enough and add other functionality too. Quick Automations Creates multi-agent automations for business processes Automate end-to-end enterprise processes with ease. Build, test, and deploy sophisticated automations using natural language or documentation. ** AI Footprint Analyst ** simply created from the prompting create be AI Foot print analyst AI which goes to UI agent Web browsing and checks information for and also it will checks latest cloud providers updates in the AI On the left side you can see we can drag a lot Action components like unzip folders , pdf text extraction , excel data extraction , UI Agent , Python code block , process flows , Data Tables ( We can perform CRUD) , Chat Agents Build personalized AI chat assistants capable of multiple integrated tasks. Summary Amazon QuickSuite is designed to cut through information overload and repetitive work, helping you rapidly build, deploy, and manage agentic AI workflows that deliver actionable insights and automation—all while ensuring security and governance. This marks a new frontier in how AI can work proactively as your teammate.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_e223b2bc951f","title":"My Code Worked. Excel’s \"Protected View\" Killed It.","content":"I am building a Micro-SaaS called SpeakSheet. The premise is simple: You speak (or type) a prompt, and it generates a structured Excel file. The stack is solid: NextJS, Tailwind, Supabase, and Gemini on the backend. This week, I tackled the hardest part of the MVP: Formulas. Teaching an LLM to understand \"Profit Margin\" is tricky. It knows the math, but it doesn't know the context. After hours of tweaking the JSON schema and refining the prompt, I finally got a green light in the console. The logic was perfect. The schema was validated. I downloaded the generated file to test it. Profit Margin: 0. I stared at the screen. I felt that specific mix of confusion and anger that only developers know. I checked the backend logs—the calculation was correct. I checked the cell data—the formula was there. But the cell displayed 0. I spent an hour debugging a bug that didn't exist. The Invisible Villain Then, I looked at the top of the Excel window. A thin yellow bar: Protected View: Be careful—files from the Internet can contain viruses. Because my software generated the file programmatically, Excel didn't trust it. It blocked the execution. It suppressed the formula results. It made my product look broken. This is the reality of building Micro-SaaS. You spend 20% of your time writing logic in NextJS, and 80% of your time fighting edge cases in the tools your customers actually use. I realized that for a user with low Excel literacy (my target audience), this is a dealbreaker. They won't click \"Enable Editing.\" They will just churn. I had to refactor the user journey to account for a security feature I have no control over. The Design Pivot (feat. Gemini 3.0) Once the logic was fixed, I looked at the UI. It was functional, but it looked like a Bootstrap template from 2015. I am a developer, not a designer. Usually, this is where I stall. I decided to test Gemini 3.0 Flash. I gave it a simple instruction: Design a modern, clean landing page for a SaaS that converts text to Excel. I expected the usual generic AI slop. Instead, it one-shot a layout that actually looked... premium. It understood whitespace. It utilized the ShadCN components correctly. It saved me two days of CSS wrestling. The Lesson Building SpeakSheet has taught me that code is only half the product. Your logic can be perfect, but if Excel's UI hides it, you failed. Your backend can be robust, but if the frontend looks cheap, you failed. I am building this in public to show the messy reality of shipping a product.

{"id":"french_connaissancedesenergies_3ed804d080e5","title":"Climat: l'UE face aux pays pétroliers et émergents, la COP30 dans l'impasse","content":"Climat: l'UE face aux pays pétroliers et émergents, la COP30 dans l'impasse Admin FCE 22 nov. 2025 - 11:55 La conférence de l'ONU sur le climat à Belém (Brésil) est entrée en prolongation samedi, avec un face-à-face entre Union européenne d'un côté et des pays pétroliers et émergents de l'autre, en désaccord frontal.Les négociations se sont poursuivies dans la nuit de vendredi à samedi, alors que la COP30 devait s'achever vendredi soir, après deux semaines de travaux. Où en est-on au petit matin?\"Nulle part\", répond la ministre française de la Transition écologique, Monique Barbut, en arrivant à une réunion avec les Vingt-Sept tôt samedi. De nombreux négociateurs n'ont pas dormi de la nuit, alors que des parties du site à Belem commencent à être démontées.Que doit dire la déclaration finale de cette COP30? La question divise les délégations venues jusqu'en Amazonie.Une séance de clôture est programmée à 10h00 (13h00 GMT), mais l'horaire pourrait changer.Pour les Européens, l'avenir passe obligatoirement par un message pour réduire les émissions de gaz à effet de serre et les énergies fossiles. Celles-ci sont responsables de la grande majorité du réchauffement. Des pays comme la Chine, la Russie, l'Arabie saoudite ou l'Inde sont désignés par la France comme menant le camp du refus. Mais une partie du monde en développement ne soutient pas non plus la bataille contre les fossiles.Ils expliquent que de nombreuses économies, pauvres ou émergentes, n'ont pas à l'heure actuelle les moyens d'une transition vers une consommation et une croissance moins denses en carbone, ou tout simplement de s'adapter à un climat déréglé. Ils réclament des pays les plus riches des engagements financiers supplémentaires pour aider les nations qui le sont moins.- Européens \"isolés\" -La présidence brésilienne de la conférence a consulté tout le monde vendredi sur une proposition d'accord qui ne contient plus le mot \"fossiles\". Et encore moins la création d'une \"feuille de route\" sur la sortie du pétrole, du charbon et du gaz, réclamée par au moins 80 pays européens, latino-américains ou insulaires, et soutenue par le président brésilien Lula lui-même.L'Union européenne a évoqué vendredi la perspective de partir \"sans accord\". Ce serait un échec retentissant pour l'hôte, le Brésil, et pour une conférence organisée dans l'une des régions emblématiques des questions environnementales posées à la planète, l'Amazonie.Mais cela pose un dilemme. Les Européens se retrouvent \"isolés\" dans leur refus du texte, selon une délégation d'un des 27. Ils hésitent sur l'attitude à adopter: claquer la porte pour marquer la gravité de la situation, ou chercher encore une conciliation par \"peur (...) d'endosser la responsabilité\" de l'échec du sommet.Le projet d'accord de la présidence brésilienne demande des \"efforts\" pour tripler les financements pour l'adaptation des pays pauvres au changement climatique. Or les État appelés à contribuer appelés sont réticents, un an après une COP29, à Bakou, qui les a déjà engagés sur dix ans.\"Concentrons-nous sur l'essentiel: l'accès à l'énergie pour les plus pauvres, la sécurité énergétique pour tous et la durabilité énergétique pour la planète\", dit à l'AFP l'Indien Arunabha Ghosh, émissaire de la COP30 pour l'Asie du Sud.- \"Nous mettre d'accord\" -Selon plusieurs observateurs et délégués interrogés par l'AFP, les débats se concentrent sur des modifications à la marge des trois principaux points de friction: l'ambition de réduction des énergies fossiles, l'aide financière due par les pays développés, et les tensions commerciales sur les taxes carbone aux frontières.\"Ceux qui doutent que la coopération soit la meilleure chose à faire pour le climat seront absolument ravis de voir qu'on n'arrive pas à nous mettre d'accord\", lançait le président de la COP30, le diplomate André Corrêa do Lago.L'idée d'une \"feuille de route\" pour accélérer la sortie du pétrole, du charbon et du gaz, est née de la frustration face au manque de concrétisation de l'engagement à leur abandon progressif pris à la COP28 il y a deux ans.Peu comptaient sur le retour de cette question au menu, jusqu'à ce que le président brésilien la remette au centre du jeu au début du sommet.Premier producteur de pétrole au monde, les États-Unis sont eux-mêmes absents de cette COP30, le président Donald Trump jugeant ces négociations inutiles. 251122105256.k4oold5h © 2025 AFP 22 nov. 2025 -

Esperaba encontrar cosas que me sorprendieran, como las bater√≠as externas que hay en cada esquina de la ciudad, pero me top√© con algo inesperado: el Galbot G1. Se trata de un robot humanoide muy distinto al resto de robots humanoides. ¬øPor qu√©? Porque este ya est√° trabajando. Y no en un almac√©n o en una f√°brica, como tantos otros, sino en un puesto mucho m√°s exigente: cara al p√∫blico. Est√° atendiendo un puesto de bebidas en un centro comercial bast√≠simo. Lo hace sin que intervenga ning√∫n humano. Y... los camareros pueden estar tranquilos. El robot que te sirve botellitas de aguaAntes de entrar al robot, vamos con algo de contexto. Galbot es otra de las much√≠simas empresas chinas que est√°n investigando la rob√≥tica. Se est√°n centrando no tanto en las piezas m√≥viles como en el 'cerebro' de estos robots: los modelos de lenguaje conectados con un sistema de visi√≥n que permita al robot manipular objetos de forma generalista. En Xataka En 2018 Rusia present√≥ a su nuevo y revolucionario robot humanoide. El √∫nico problema es que no era un robot Esto implica que puede salirse de rutinas preprogramadas para reaccionar en tiempo real. Su cerebro est√° potenciado por hardware NVIDIA Jetson Thor, que es el que permite que ejecute ese LLM en tiempo real, y tiene dos claves: Navega sin necesidad de que haya marcadores en el suelo. No lo hace con piernas, sino con una base que le otorga menos flexibilidad, pero una mayor autonom√≠a y estabilidad.Su sistema permite que perciba lo que le rodea, lo \"entienda\" y reaccione bas√°ndose en esa percepci√≥n.En definitiva: miles y miles de d√≥lares invertidos en crear un robot con un objetivo: servirme una botella de agua. Imagen | Xataka Cuando nos topamos con el puesto, fue de casualidad. no hab√≠a nadie pidiendo, todas las filas de botellas estaban intactas y era hasta extra√±o. Pero como la ciencia no se hace sola, me acerqu√©, decidido a comprar la botella de agua de sabor m√°s barata que hubiera para hacer la prueba. El proceso no podr√≠a ser m√°s sencillo: Escoges producto.Pagas con AliPay/WeChat.El robot hace los suyo.Te vas. El problema es que puedo estar definiendo el trabajo de un robot que ha costado un dineral, pero tambi√©n puedo estar describiendo el proceso de comprar en una m√°quina expendedora Goya. Hay dos diferencias: el robot mola m√°s... y tarda much√≠simo m√°s. ¬øCu√°nto? Aqu√≠ lo tienes: Como barman, meh. En un almac√©n tiene sentidoLo cierto es que mi sensaci√≥n fue extra√±a y lo primero que pens√© fue \"los camareros pueden estar tranquilos porque esto no es una amenaza\". Pero tambi√©n me pregunt√© hasta qu√© punto el Galbot G1 que me hab√≠a atendido no era m√°s que una prueba de concepto en el mundo real y las intenciones de la compa√±√≠a son otras. Y, efectivamente. Toda esa tecnolog√≠a y razonamiento en tiempo real, con percepci√≥n del espacio f√≠sico gracias a sus numerosas c√°maras y sensores ubicadas por varias partes del cuerpo, no est√° ah√≠ para servirme botellitas de unos pocos c√©ntimos, sino para realizar trabajos en entornos en los que realmente puede ser √∫til: el de la log√≠stica. Porque frente a la acrobacia, este G1 (porque el Unitree tambi√©n es un G1) apuesta por demostrar su viabilidad en usos comerciales reales actualmente. Uno es la hosteler√≠a \"ligera\", como puede ser el kiosko en el que compr√©, pero tambi√©n la log√≠stica en espacios controlados en √∫ltima milla. Aplicaciones a las que apunta Galbot Es el v√≠deo demostraci√≥n justo sobre estas l√≠neas, donde vemos esa adaptabilidad del Galbot cuando le mueven las cajas. El tiempo de respuesta en el que analiza la situaci√≥n es similar al que vi cuando ped√≠ mi botellita, y esos puestos de venta en algunas zonas de China no son m√°s que un entrenamiento, o esa sensaci√≥n me da, para su modelo de inteligencia artificial. La cola que se mont√≥ justo cuando ped√≠. Antes estaba vac√≠o. Imagen | Xataka De momento, curiosidad, un Furby, una atracci√≥n, pero en ciertos ambientes, puede ser de lo m√°s √∫til. Como m√°quina de vending, no, aunque llama much√≠simo la atenci√≥n, y se form√≥ una buena cola no para comprar... sino para ver c√≥mo compraba. Im√°genes | Xataka En Xataka | Un robot llamado \"Sardinator\" circulaba por las calles de M√°laga promocionando un chiringuito. Hasta que lleg√≥ la polic√≠a - La noticia Me ha servido el primer robot camarero aut√≥nomo de China.

{"id":"portuguese_canaltech_b3a889a2c812","title":"Como criar um grupo com amigos no ChatGPT","content":"Os chats em grupo do ChatGPT podem ser usados para reunir várias pessoas em uma única conversa, colaborar com a ajuda da IA e ainda compartilhar arquivos, imagens e ideias em tempo real — tudo com controles de privacidade. A ferramenta está disponível para todos os planos e plataformas. ChatGPT ganha conversas em grupo para coordenar projetos no app GPT-5.1 chegou: o que muda no novo modelo do ChatGPT? A seguir, tire suas dúvidas sobre: Como criar grupo no ChatGPT? Quem pode acessar o recurso? Quando a IA responde? Quem tem acesso às conversas? O que o ChatGPT consegue fazer nos grupos? Como criar grupo no ChatGPT? Para criar conversas em grupo no ChatGPT, siga os passos abaixo: -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Entre no ChatGPT no PC ou celular; Abra um novo chat; No canto superior direito, clique no ícone de pessoa; Toque em “Iniciar conversa em grupo”; Na nova tela, clique em “Copiar link” e compartilhe o link de convite com os integrantes. Dá para criar conversas em grupo no ChatGPT para várias pessoas interagirem ao mesmo tempo com a IA. (Imagem: Captura de tela/Viviane França/Canaltech) Quem pode acessar o recurso? O recurso de chats em grupo está disponível em todos os planos do ChatGPT, na Web e nos apps para iOS e Android. Cada grupo aceita até 20 pessoas, com entrada apenas por convite. O link pode ser compartilhado, redefinido ou apagado por qualquer membro. Para contas de adolescentes, pais e responsáveis podem ativar controles parentais, inclusive bloquear o uso de grupos. Quando a IA responde? O ChatGPT participa do grupo como um membro, mas não responde tudo: Por padrão, ele usa respostas automáticas e entra na conversa quando alguém faz uma pergunta ou pede ajuda; Se quiser chamar a IA diretamente, basta mencionar “ChatGPT” ou “@ChatGPT”; É possível desativar as respostas automáticas. Nesse modo, o bot só fala quando for mencionado; Cada resposta da IA conta no limite de uso do plano do usuário que acionou a mensagem. Quem tem acesso às conversas? Nos chats em grupo do ChatGPT, qualquer pessoa que entra por link pode visualizar todo o histórico da conversa. A IA só acessa o que é compartilhado naquele grupo, como mensagens, arquivos e perfis, e não vê conversas privadas, memória da conta ou instruções gerais dos usuários. O que o ChatGPT consegue fazer nos grupos? Nos chats em grupo, o ChatGPT ajuda a organizar ideias, planejar eventos, responder dúvidas, pesquisar, resumir conteúdos e criar textos mantendo todos alinhados no mesmo contexto. As respostas usam o modelo GPT-5.1 Auto, que escolhe a melhor versão conforme o plano e o tipo de pergunta. Além disso, os usuários podem acessar os seguintes recursos: Pesquisa na web; Geração de imagens; Upload e análise de fotos; Upload e leitura de documentos; Reações com emoji e threads; Instruções personalizadas por grupo; Uso do microfone para ditar mensagens; Criação de imagens usando foto de perfil.

{"id":"portuguese_canaltech_7243a6268747","title":"Nano Banana Pro e mais: tudo o que o Google anunciou em IA nesta semana","content":"O Google segue avançando em suas ferramentas e recursos voltados à inteligência artificial (IA), e os anúncios feitos ao longo desta semana são um bom exemplo disso. Gemini 3, Nano Banana Pro e o identificador de imagens geradas por IA foram os principais lançamentos da big tech nos últimos dias. O que muda do Nano Banana para o Nano Banana Pro? Conheça as IAs do Google Como usar a IA Gemini do Google | Guia Prático As atualizações e novas ferramentas trazem aprimoramentos principalmente no raciocínio das IAs, oferecendo aos usuários novas possibilidades para criar conteúdos com mais criatividade e personalização, de acordo com cada necessidade. A seguir, o Canaltech lista os principais detalhes dos lançamentos de IA do Google nesta semana. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Gemini 3 O Gemini 3 é considerado o modelo de IA mais avançado já lançado pelo Google até o momento, e o anúncio da sua chegada aconteceu na terça-feira (18). Ele veio acompanhado de mudanças no visual do aplicativo Gemini para celulares, incluindo uma aba para acessar as mídias mais recentes. Uma das principais novidades do Gemini 3 são as interfaces generativas, que permitem criar experiências mais imersivas e interativas durante as conversas com o chatbot. A ferramenta também foi integrada ao Modo IA da busca, com o objetivo de trazer resultados mais completos para as solicitações. Há ainda o novo modo \"Raciocínio\", voltado a pesquisas complexas que exigem um processamento mais detalhado para gerar respostas. A big tech destaca ainda que a nova versão da IA conta com evolução multimodal, com desempenho superior no entendimento de comandos de voz, texto, imagem, vídeo e código — identificando com mais precisão as particularidades de cada prompt. Gemini 3 permite gerar experiências imersivas e interativas com interfaces generativas (Divulgação/Google) O Gemini 3 já está disponível? Sim. A nova versão já pode ser acessada no aplicativo Gemini, no Modo IA da busca e em outras aplicações do ecossistema Google. No app, todos os usuários têm acesso ao Gemini 3 Pro, mas assinantes dos planos Google AI Plus, Pro e Ultra contam com limites de uso maiores. Nano Banana Pro A semana de lançamentos do Google também contou com o anúncio do Nano Banana Pro no app Gemini, nesta quinta-feira (20). A atualização foi desenvolvida com base no Gemini 3 Pro e aprimorou sua capacidade de interpretar dados para gerar diagramas, infográficos e materiais didáticos com mais precisão. A nova versão também traz avanços na renderização de texto dentro das imagens, com otimizações de ortografia, alinhamento e consistência tipográfica. Além disso, há agora um suporte aprimorado para idiomas internacionais. Usuários do Nano Banana Pro também podem utilizar recursos de “estúdio” para criar e editar imagens. Ajustes de iluminação, foco, ângulo da câmera e até mesmo formato da imagem estão entre novas possibilidades. A atualização do modelo conta ainda com um recurso que permite misturar diversas fotos em uma única imagem final. É possível combinar até 14 imagens diferentes, mas, no caso de fotos com rostos, a ferramenta mantém a consistência de até 5 pessoas. Nano Banan Pro mantém a consistência facial de até 5 pessoas em imagens combinadas (Divulgação/Google) O Nano Banana Pro é grátis? Sim. O Nano Banana Pro pode ser utilizado gratuitamente no Gemini, mas o plano gratuito tem um limite de cotas diárias e, quando ele é atingido, o sistema volta automaticamente para o Nano Banana padrão. Assinantes dos planos Google AI Plus, Pro e Ultra recebem cotas maiores e conseguem usar a versão Pro do gerador de imagens com mais frequência. Identificador de imagens geradas por IA No mesmo comunicado de lançamento do Nano Banana Pro, o Google anunciou que agora será possível enviar fotos ao Gemini para verificar se o conteúdo foi gerado pela IA da empresa. Essa verificação — que em breve também analisará áudios e vídeos produzidos artificialmente — utiliza a tecnologia SynthID. Desenvolvida pela Google DeepMind, a SynthID insere marcas d’água e assinaturas digitais invisíveis ao olho humano em imagens, textos, áudios e vídeos gerados artificialmente pelos recursos do próprio Google.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_9757018ad76a","title":"Hay exactamente cinco cosas con las que 100% no has soñado. Y la ciencia ya sabe por qué","content":"El mundo de los sueños tiene sus propias reglas. Es un lugar donde lo imposible parece ser lo rutinario, pero, paradójicamente, algunas de las tareas más mundanas de nuestra vida se convierten en algo imposible de que aparezcan en nuestros sueños. Y esto es algo que puede provocarnos muchas preguntas de por qué no hemos soñado algunas cosas en concreto. Los ejemplos. Avisamos que esto es algo que te puede romper la cabeza, porque la pregunta es obligada: ¿alguna vez has intentado leer un texto en un sueño? (si es que te acuerdas) o ¿Has sacado el móvil para descubrir una interfaz incomprensible? Todo esto no es una casualidad, porque en la realidad es que hay algunas cosas que no podemos soñar nunca como todos esperábamos (aunque sean sueños muy reales). Tiene una explicación. La ciencia cuenta con varias razones en su regazo para convencernos de por qué los elementos de la vida moderna como el smartphone o las interfaces de ordenador tienen poca cabida en nuestros sueños. Todo se centra en que durante la fase de sueño REM la actividad en las redes prefrontales del cerebro están muy disminuidas. Y justamente es aquí donde se tiene 'almacenado' el control ejecutivo y el lenguaje. En Xataka Si cuando madrugas mucho tienes la sensación de \"ir borracho\", no estás solo: la ciencia ha descubierto por qué De esta manera, si durante el sueño estas neuronas están 'dormidas', entonces no vamos a poder leer correctamente un texto o incluso a coger un smartphone en las manos. Cuando dormimos, parece ser que no queremos trabajar o estar usando el móvil. Esto se debe a que en este rango de tiempo la actividad del área límbica, relacionada con la parte emocional y visual, se dispara. Esto se traduce en que el contenido de los sueños se incline hacia lo asociativo, lo visual y lo emocional, en lugar de hacia tareas que requieren de un gran foco analítico como operar una interfaz compleja. De esta manera, el material de nuestra vida despierta no se copia literalmente a los sueños, sino que se integra de forma selectiva y transformada, priorizando la carga emocional sobre la fidelidad funcional. La pesadilla de leer. El mismo principio neurocognitivo que hemos visto es el que explica otro de los fenómenos más conocidos: la incapacidad de leer textos de forma estable. Lo que se provoca básicamente es que los caracteres literalmente se 'mueven' o distorsionan porque no se están estimulando tanto las redes del lenguaje. Esto se aplica igualmente a los números, los cálculos matemáticos o la simple tarea de mirar la hora en un reloj digital. Los estímulos que requieren una precisión simbólica fina tienden a volverse ilegibles o a cambiar constantemente. Aunque algunos estudios con soñadores lúcidos han demostrado que se pueden realizar operaciones básicas bajo condiciones experimentales, fuera del laboratorio, la estabilidad de los símbolos es casi nula. Ni olor ni sabor. Mientras la vista y el oído dominan el paisaje onírico, otras modalidades sensoriales están prácticamente ausentes. Los estudios sistemáticos basados en diarios de sueño son consistentes al mostrar que las experiencias olfativas y gustativas son extremadamente infrecuentes. Las cifras sitúan su aparición en aproximadamente el 1% de todos los informes de sueños. Incluso en experimentos de laboratorio donde se manipula el ambiente olfativo durante la noche, la mayoría de los participantes no reporta haber olido nada en sus sueños, reforzando la idea de que los sentidos químicos son una rareza en este estado. El espejo. Es otro fenómeno bastante común en los sueños: verse reflejado en el espejo es algo casi imposible de conseguir. En los sueños, esta se genera predominantemente \"de arriba abajo\" (top-down), es decir, desde las propias redes cerebrales y con muy poca o ninguna información sensorial del exterior. En Xataka La relación entre sueño y Alzheimer, en una “sencilla” acción: nuestro cerebro también tiene que hacer limpieza Debido a esto, los detalles de alta resolución, como un rostro propio reflejado, un texto o una interfaz, tienden a transformarse o distorsionarse en cuanto intentamos examinarlos con detenimiento. La estabilidad visual no es la norma. El contenido ancestral. En marcado contraste con la ausencia de móviles o libros, hay un tipo de contenido que parece estar sobrerrepresentado: las amenazas. Soñar con ser perseguido, caer, enfrentarse a peligros o incluso con elementos como tormentas o serpientes es extremadamente usual. Y en muchas ocasiones lo recordamos perfectamente porque justamente nos hemos despertado al momento sudando o con el corazón a cien. Esto respalda la conocida \"Hipótesis de Simulación de Amenazas\" (TST), propuesta por el filósofo Antti Revonsuo. Esta teoría sugiere que los sueños podrían tener una función evolutiva: servir como un “entrenamiento” virtual para ensayar cómo responder ante un peligro en la vida real. Sin embargo, la propia literatura científica señala que esta hipótesis, aunque plausible y con apoyo, también es objeto de debate y presenta resultados mixtos al compararla entre diferentes culturas y entornos.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_c23033d1cc3f","title":"Los \"cozy games\" nos iban a salvar del estrés y la productividad. Han terminado siendo auténticos esclavistas del ocio","content":"La promesa de relajarte y despejar tu mente durante unas horas es lo que nos atrae de los cozy games: esos juegos que nos rodean de animalitos cuquis, nos calman con una paleta visual reconfortante y nos plantean tareas repetitivas y amables que nos hacen huir del estrés. Todo parece muy bucólico; heredas una granja, plantas flores, decoras estancias o fabricas muebles de ensueño, con la promesa de escapar por unas horas de la rutina diaria. Sin embargo, esa especie de refugio digital se ha convertido en la materialización de aquello de lo que querías huir; en un segundo Google Calendar repleto de reuniones, en un clon de tu trabajo de 9 a 5. Y 'Tiny Bookshop' nos lo reafirma. Lanzado este verano,‘Tiny Bookshop' se convirtió rápidamente en un éxito dentro de la abarrotada categoría cozy. La premisa es clara: llegas a un pueblo pequeñito y encantador con tu nuevo proyecto de librería ambulante, la cual puedes decorar con cientos de posibilidades. A través de tu relación con los vecinos consigues vender y recomendar una gran cantidad de libros y, a su vez, descubrir todos los secretos del pueblo. En Xataka 'GTA 6' parece invencible, pero quizás tanto retraso acabe pasándole factura Todo este punto inicial es más que llamativo para seguidores del género (como una servidora). Pasadas más horas de las que me gustaría admitir, me percaté de que había vuelto a caer en la trampa de los juegos cozy: dedicar horas y horas a un trabajo. Bajo lo adorable de poder pintar todo de tonos pastel o recomendar a tus clientes ‘Jane Eyre’, al final te encuentras con que llevas un buen rato en una dinámica de búsqueda de objetos para incrementar tus ventas, revisar el horario de apertura del día siguiente y estar al tanto para reponer las estanterías con el género adecuado. Esto puedes llamarlo cozy, pero yo lo llamo emular otra jornada laboral más; y lo que es peor, disfrutándola. Recomienda todo tipo de libros en 'Tiny Bookshop' A principios de la década del 2010 se puso bastante de moda, auspiciado por los gurús de Silicon Valley, una tendencia llamada “gamificación del trabajo”. Mediante mecánicas propias de videojuego o juegos de mesa, se añadían misiones, puntos o recompensas dentro del día a día de las monótonas tareas laborales. Cabe preguntarse si los cozy games han hecho el camino inverso, “trabaficando” los videojuegos. Es cierto que, como suele ocurrir con estos juegos acogedores, es fácil divertirse con ellos y sumergirte de lleno en la historia. Las interacciones son adorables, los personajes tiernos y tienen ese aire de “peli de tarde\" que los hace irresistibles; pero al final no podemos omitir que estamos replicando tareas de las que se supone huimos, como pasar horas y horas trabajando. Y sí, todo depende del tipo de jugador que seas y como manejes los objetivos del juego, pero los cozy games pocas veces tienen que ver con algo cómodo o cálido. Hemos romantizado hasta pagar una hipoteca No estamos hablando de una cosa puntual que sucede con este nuevo lanzamiento, completar o realizar las tareas diarias de este estilo de juegos puede ser lo menos relajante que existe. Con el pináculo de los cozy, ‘Stardew Valley’, el día no da para más entre ordeñar a las vacas, recoger los huevos, hacer mermelada e ir a la mina para conseguir objetos. Además, como si de la propia vida real se tratase, después de todas esas tareas, hay que poner buena cara e interactuar con los vecinos. Algo parecido sucede con otro de los grandes nombres de la categoría como es ‘Animal Crossing’: tienes que regalar objetos a tus compañeros de isla, talar árboles, plantar flores, pescar y estar atento al día que llega el personaje que se encarga de comprar tu recolección, para poder conseguir dinero e ir pagando la hipoteca. Si, una hipoteca de una casa preciosa, pero Tom Nook no perdona los plazos. Tras todo esto sería interesante comprobar las pulsaciones de los jugadores cuando su personaje se va a dormir después de cumplir con todas esas tareas. Pásate el día talando árboles en 'Animal Crossing' Al convertirse en algo más mainstream y producir unas ventas más que sustanciosas desde su auge en la pandemia, hay infinidad de juegos que adoptan la etiqueta de “cozy” para captar al público, incluso cuando sus dinámicas se alejan de lo que caracteriza al género. Vale la pena preguntarse si dentro de esta etiqueta, los mayores exponentes no deberían ser juegos como ‘Abzu’ o ‘Unpacking’, donde se lleva a rajatabla el “no tienes que hacer nada” y los objetivos no cuentan con un temporizador. Lo contemplativo y lo mecánico es lo esencial en estos ejemplos, haciendo honor a esa parte “cozy” de refugio mental con paz, serenidad y tareas que se repiten una y otra vez. En Xataka Toda una generación de internautas no entiende los memes modernos. Quieren hacer borrón y cuenta nueva para empezar de nuevo De hecho, hay hasta metacrítica dentro de este mundo. 'Wanderstop', un simulador de tienda de té creado por la visionaria mente detrás de 'The Stanley Parable', Davey Wreden. El juego ironiza sobre este hecho con un personaje que te invita a atender las peticiones de los clientes cuando te parezca bien, sin prisa, porque lo último que necesita la protagonista es más presión. Es curioso que la mayoría de juegos cozy traten sobre salud mental o ansiedad, pero que unos tengan mecánicas en consonancia con ello y otros ofrezcan unas radicalmente opuestas a los sentimientos que buscan crear en el jugador. La perversión del lenguaje, o el uso desmedido de una etiqueta como es “cozy” para vender más copias acaba produciendo una realidad muy concreta: algo está roto cuando lo primero que nos viene a la mente cuando hablamos de estos juegos reconfortantes es cuidar una granja o un supermercado, regar las chirivías o pagar la ampliación de tu casa. La productividad como ocio Más allá de las mecánicas y la calidad de cada uno de ellos, la adicción y fanatismo que nos generan no hace más que ponernos frente al espejo y exponer la realidad de nuestro día a día: incluso con nuestro ocio queremos ser productivos, supeditando el descanso a un esquema de metas y resultados. Con los cozy games conseguimos esa sensación terapéutica y de bienestar gracias a que dicha búsqueda de la productividad, con su estética adorable y música ambiental, no le acompaña consecuencias negativas. Y así, nos encontramos jugando a ‘Stardew Valley’ o ‘Tiny Bookshop’ víctimas de un capitalismo cuqui que llega incluso a lo emocional; en estos juegos se trabaja, invierte y decora, no solo por moneda si no también por el afecto de los demás. En Xataka El día en que 'Los Simpson' se codearon con 'Toy Story': el mítico episodio que cambió la historia de la televisión De modo que, el foco de su éxito quizá no reside en la tarea en sí, sino en lo que nos hace sentir; no podemos negar lo atractivo de realizar una tarea sin presión y sin plazos o de interacciones amables donde no existen jefes ni relaciones tóxicas. Y, también, puede que más allá del uso compulsivo de tareas asociables a un trabajo común, seamos nosotros, los jugadores, los que tenemos el problema dentro de nosotros. Nadie me obligaba a progresar más rápido en ‘Tiny Bookshop’, y aún así me encontré buscando una guía en internet para completar alguna misión de forma más ágil. Parece, por lo tanto, que al ocio también ha llegado esa sensación de “no llego” y nuestros hobbies parecen requerir una gran inversión de tiempo. Es muy difícil estar al día de las tendencias, filtrar fake news, leer la novedad viral y además ver la nueva temporada de la serie de moda. Así que, quizá, también en nuestro rato libre nos dejamos llevar por esa falsa sensación de descanso que nos produce otra jornada laboral virtual.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_b3492997852d","title":"Opera Neon promete ser el futuro del navegador. Es una visión ambiciosa todavía por madurar","content":"Llevo una semana usando Opera Neon y no sé si estoy probando el futuro de la navegación web o participando en un experimento psicológico sobre cuánta fricción tolera un humano antes de volver a su navegador habitual. Probablemente ambas cosas. Neon trae de serie todo lo que cualquier usuario veterano de Opera da por hecho: las integraciones laterales de mensajería, las apps de música en streaming, el panel multimedia... Es el recordatorio de que, pese a toda la experimentación agéntica, sigue habiendo un Opera debajo: práctico, cómodo y pensado para quien vive pegado a varias plataformas a la vez. La promesa es seductora: un navegador que no solo responde preguntas, sino que actúa por ti. Que navega, compara, reserva, crea. Que entiende lo que quieres hacer y lo hace mientras tú te dedicas a cosas más importantes. Opera llama a esto \"agentic AI\", y técnicamente es correcto: Neon puede tomar el control del navegador, abrir pestañas, rellenar formularios, comparar productos. Es IA con manos, es la propuesta de Opera para el mismo campo que Perplexity con Comet u OpenAI con ChatGPT Atlas. El problema es que esas manos a veces son torpes, impredecibles y peligrosamente confiadas. Opera Neon mantiene todas las bondades clásicas de Opera, como los paneles laterales para desplegar en una capa superior miniaplicaciones de mensajería o música en streaming. En la imagen, Apple Music. Imagen: Xataka. Tres cerebros en un solo cuerpoPara entender Neon tienes que aceptar que no es un navegador con IA. Es un navegador con tres IAs viviendo juntas. Chat, Do y Make. Cada una con su función, su propósito, su personalidad. Y aquí empieza el primer gran problema: saber cuál usar en cada momento es un ejercicio de adivinanza. Chat es la más familiar. Un chatbot conversacional que responde preguntas, resume páginas, traduce textos. Lo típico. Funciona bien cuando no se inventa cosas, que es aproximadamente el 70% del tiempo. Le pedí que contara los comentarios de varios artículos y me respondió con 400 palabras explicando que no había ninguno. Cuando había cuatro.Do es donde vive la magia y el terror. Le pides que reserve una clase de CrossFit, que encuentre el vuelo más barato a Lisboa, que compare precios de auriculares, que me desuscriba de algunas newsletters. Y a veces lo hace. Abre pestañas, navega por sitios web, rellena campos. Verlo trabajar es hipnótico. También es lento, errático y ocasionalmente catastrófico. En una prueba le pedí que añadiera flores al carrito de una tienda. En lugar de inferir de alguna forma mi código postal o preguntarme por él, directamente introdujo el 28001: madridcentrismo al canto. Mientras yo, impotente, hacía click en las opciones correctas que ignoraba por completo. No hay forma de corregirlo mientras trabaja. Solo puedes observar, como quien ve a su coche autónomo acercarse peligrosamente al precipicio. Un código postal puesto porque sí, a 350 km de mi casa. Imagen: Xataka. Neon se quedó durante una cantidad absurda de tiempo dando vueltas por la web, añadiendo el ramo al carro, atascándose en el código postal de envío, sin sentir que nada productivo estaba ocurriendo. Imagen: Xataka. Otro ejemplo con Do: Imagen: Xataka. Lo que hizo fue abrir Google Shopping, introducir el término y no poder darle a 'Buscar', aparentemente por algún cambio sutil en el código de la web. Le di yo mismo y Neon continuó. Tardó bastante simplemente en escoger el orden por precio de menor a mayor. Finalmente escribió la respuesta: Imagen: Xataka. Final feliz, aunque cuesta pensar en escenarios de uso donde realmente compense el uso frente al tiempo y la supervisión que requiere. Si alguien no conoce la existencia de Google Shopping, este es un buen caso de uso. Si alguien conoce Google Shopping, solo tiene que hacer dos clicks. Otro ejemplo: leyendo unas recetas de Directo al Paladar, le pedí que añadiera todos los ingredientes necesarios para hacerlas al carrito de Mercadona. Vamos al lío. Imagen: Xataka. Imagen: Xataka. Este fue uno de esos escenarios en los que no hubo forma de que llegara a completar la misión. Imagen: Xataka. Make es la más ambiciosa. Genera código, construye aplicaciones web, crea vídeos. Le pedí un juego de memoria con vocabulario en español y lo hizo en minutos. Tosco, pero funcional. Es como tener un minidesarrollador viviendo en tu navegador, trabajando en un entorno virtual que desaparece cuando cierras la pestaña. Una idea brillante. Poco pulida quizás, pero brillante. Imagen: Xataka. También están las Cards, una especie de plantillas de prompts que funcionan como atajos mentales. Puedes combinarlas —“resumir + comparar”, “decisiones + seguimiento”— o crear las tuyas propias para no empezar desde cero cada vez que hablas con la IA. Es una idea sencilla pero potente: convierte el aprendizaje del usuario en parte del sistema. Similar a lo que propone Dia con sus Skills. Es una buena idea. Lo que no se está diciendo sobre Opera NeonAquí viene la parte que me interesa más, la que leo entre líneas después de una semana conviviendo con esta cosa. Opera Neon no es realmente un producto. Es un campo de pruebas con precio de producto. Es una beta pública disfrazada de servicio premium. Y eso no sería tan problemático si no costara 20 dólares al mes. Déjenme ser claro: he visto suficientes lanzamientos tecnológicos para reconocer cuándo una empresa está probando conceptos en campo abierto. Y Neon es eso. Los bugs no son ocasionales, son estructurales, como las alucinaciones. El agente Do se desconecta si tu ordenador entra en suspensión. Las respuestas de Chat son verborreicas. La interfaz de Cards —esos atajos de prompts reutilizables— está llena de ejemplos sin contenido útil real. Interfaz de los ejemplos de Cards. Imagen: Xataka. Pero hay algo más interesante sucediendo aquí. Opera está haciendo una apuesta contraintuitiva en el peor momento posible. Estamos en 2025: Google regala Gemini en Chrome.Perplexity tiene Comet.The Browser Company (la empresa de Arc) tiene Dia.Microsoft mete Copilot por todas partes.Y OpenAI lanzó hace poco ChatGPT Atlas. El consenso de la industria (Dia es la excepción) es claro: la IA en navegadores debe ser gratis, ubicua, invisible. Y Opera aparece con un producto que cuesta lo mismo que una suscripción a ChatGPT Plus (que te permite usar Atlas por completo además de todo un ChatGPT), que falla más que acierta, y que te pide que cambies toda tu forma de navegar por Internet. Es una locura. O es genialidad. La tesis subyacente (y por qué podría tener razón) Aquí está lo que creo que Opera entiende y el resto no: si la IA va a hacer cosas por ti de verdad, no puede ser gratis. No me refiero solo al coste computacional, que es real. Me refiero a algo más profundo. Si un navegador va a tomar control de tus pestañas, acceder a sitios donde estás logueado, realizar compras, enviar correos, etc, necesita un modelo de negocio que no sea \"te espiamos y vendemos tus datos\". Necesita un modelo de negocio donde tú seas el cliente, no el producto. En Xataka Opera lleva 30 años plantando cara a gigantes como Microsoft, Google y Apple. Así planea seguir haciéndolo otros 30 años La arquitectura de Neon apunta en esa dirección. Do ejecuta localmente las tareas sensibles. No envía tus contraseñas a la nube. Funciona con los sitios donde ya estás autenticado sin compartir credenciales con servidores de terceros. Es un diseño híbrido: local cuando puede, nube cuando debe. Esto es importante porque estamos a punto de entregar muchísimo poder a estos agentes. Y Opera está apostando —quizá prematuramente, pero apostando— a que la gente pagará por un agente que no vende su información a cambio. 20 euros al mes es el precio que pide. El problema del momento Pero hay un problema de timing que Opera no puede resolver solo con buenas intenciones. Llegamos a esta era de navegadores agénticos desde un lugar de hartazgo. Estamos cansados de la tecnología que nos pide más atención, más datos, más tiempo. Y Opera nos presenta un navegador que literalmente te pone gafas de realidad virtual pero para navegar por Internet. Que te pide que confíes ciegamente mientras un bot abre quince pestañas y rellena formularios. Que te dice: \"dame más control, no menos\". La ironía es que el concepto es sólido. De verdad. Hay tareas en Internet que son pura fricción burocrática. Comparar 47 vuelos, reservar citas, buscar el mismo producto en cinco tiendas. Cosas que no requieren creatividad humana, solo tiempo y paciencia. Automatizar eso mucho tiene sentido. El problema es que Neon no lo hace lo suficientemente bien todavía. Y nos pide que confiemos (y paguemos) mientras aprende. ¿Vale 20 dólares al mes?Esta es la pregunta. Y la respuesta honesta es: depende de quién seas y cómo de desesperado estés por recuperar tiempo. Si eres un power user que se pasa el día haciendo investigaciones complejas, comparando información de múltiples fuentes, generando informes, construyendo herramientas pequeñas... Neon tiene sentido. La función de Tasks —espacios de trabajo con contexto compartido entre pestañas— es realmente útil. Poder preguntarle al navegador \"compara estos tres productos que tengo abiertos\" sin copiar y pegar nada es magia cuando funciona.Si eres un usuario normal que solo quiere navegar por Internet... puedes hacerlo con Neon sin tener que pagar, pero casi todos los demás navegadores también son gratis. Incluido, probablemente, el que ya usas.Pero más allá del cálculo individual, Neon plantea una pregunta incómoda sobre el futuro. Si los navegadores van a volverse verdaderamente agénticos —y todo indica que sí—, ¿quién capturará el valor de esa automatización? ¿Las empresas de IA que cobran subscripciones? ¿Las empresas que dominan la distribución como Apple o Google? ¿O quedará como commodity, con los modelos de código abierto igualando a los propietarios en meses? Opera está apostando a que llegará pronto a algo que los demás no puedan replicar. Que su arquitectura híbrida, su sistema de Tasks y Cards, su modelo de subscripción, construirán un moat defensivo. Pero tras una semana de uso, no veo ese moat. Veo una buena ejecución de conceptos que otros pueden copiar. El veredicto provisionalOpera Neon es fascinante, frustrante y prematuro. Es el futuro llegando con las costuras al aire, pidiendo 20 dólares al mes por el privilegio de verlas. No lo recomendaría a casi nadie ahora mismo, solo a entusiastas y early adopters. Pero no quiero dejar de usarlo. Porque de todos los navegadores IA que he probado, este es de los pocos que realmente intentan cambiar qué es un navegador, no solo añadirle funciones. Y eso, aunque sea torpe, aunque falle, aunque cueste demasiado, merece atención. Aunque sea compartida El futuro de la web probablemente se parezca a algo como Neon. Solo que funcionará mejor, costará menos, y llegará cuando estemos listos para él. No creo que sea ahora, todavía.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_48d69e0acf97","title":"Llevamos varias semanas seguidas con estrenos de Stephen King. ¿Es que no sabemos hacer otra cosa?","content":"El otoño de 2025 ha traído consigo una avalancha de Stephen King: casi en semanas consecutivas hemos tenido el estreno de 'La larga marcha' y 'The Running Man', y poco antes arrancó la serie 'It: Bienvenidos a Derry' en HBO Max. Tres grandes producciones en apenas un mes. ¿Estamos ante una industria sin imaginación que recurre constantemente al mismo autor, o es que King sigue ofreciendo algo que otros no consiguen? La respuesta tiene tres claves: la llamada Kingaissance, el factor decisivo del streaming y el valor actual de King, que no se ha devaluado con malas adaptaciones. Desmontando el mito. Para desmentir la supuesta dependencia de King dentro del género de terror basta con mirar los últimos doce meses de estrenos. El terror independiente está gozando de una edad dorada insospechada: 'Longlegs', por ejemplo, recaudó más de cien millones de dólares en taquilla con un presupuesto de apenas diez, y películas como 'La sustancia' han dotado al terror de un aliento de calidad de toda la vida, nominaciones a los Oscar incluidas. Se recuperan franquicias clásicas como 'Destino final', 'Frankenstein' arrasa en Netflix y se ha generado un star system de creadores de terror: el citado Perkins, Prano Bailey-Bond, Danny y Michael Philippou, Zach Creggar o Rose Glass, entre otros. La Kingaissance. Los medios anglosajones acuñaron un término para describir lo que está ocurriendo: la \"Kingaissance\", un renacimiento que tiene fecha de nacimiento precisa. En septiembre de 2017, 'It' de Andy Muschietti se convirtió en un fenómeno cultural inesperado: con apenas treinta y cinco millones de presupuesto, recaudó más de setecientos globalmente, convirtiéndose en la película de terror más taquillera de la historia sin ajustar inflación. En Xataka Por qué 'It' es la novela definitiva de Stephen King Lo que siguió fue una avalancha. Sin exhaustividad: 'Doctor Sleep', 'Cementerio de animales', 'Ojos de fuego', 'Salem's Lot', 'En la hierba alta', las series 'Apocalipsis' y 'Chapelwaite'... Y ahora, tres adaptaciones más, a las que se sumarán la futura 'Carrie' televisiva de Mike Flanagan, 'El talismán' para Netflix y quizás una nueva 'Cujo'. La diferencia con los años ochenta es abismal. Entonces predominaban las TV movies y la serie B: ahora son series en HBO y películas con directores consolidados. El propio King tiene a menudo control creativo y participa como productor ejecutivo en muchos de estos proyectos. El factor streaming. Durante décadas, las adaptaciones de novelas más largas de King se han visto perjudicadas al tener que comprimir su duración a los márgenes del largometraje. El streaming cambió las reglas del juego: ahora las plataformas permiten series de ocho o diez episodios que respetan la complejidad narrativa del autor, algo que antes solo se había experimentado en formato miniserie, en producciones como la primera versión de 'It' o 'La tienda'. Sucedió con '11.22.63', con 'El extraño', con 'La historia de Lisey' (que escribió personalmente King)... Ahora es el turno de la precuela de la última versión de 'It', y está claro cómo funciona la lógica de las plataformas: buscan IPs reconocibles, y King ofrece decenas de historias con estructura dramática a prueba de bombas. '' Pero hubo malas adaptaciones de King. Y no mataron a la gallina de los huevos de oro. Sucede desde siempre: hay adaptaciones en formato miniserie en los noventa, como 'The Langoliers' o 'El resplandor' que son un pestiño. Desde los noventa hubo tantas películas flojas de King como notables. Muy reciente es la horrenda 'La torre oscura' de 2017, que comprimió ocho novelas en 95 minutos desastrosos. O 'Cell', absolutamente olvidable. ¿Por qué estas catástrofes no hundieron el valor de King? Primero, las novelas originales siguen siendo, en el peor de los casos, más que legibles, y en los mejores, directamente excelentes: el material original es indestructible. Segundo, los lectores distinguen claramente entre autor y adaptación, siguen apreciando al escritor y siguen probando suerte en las adaptaciones. Tercero, las buenas adaptaciones ('El resplandor', 'Carrie', 'It', 'Misery', la 'Cementerio de animales' original) son tan buenas que siempre vamos a volver a por más. En Xataka No todas las novelas de Stephen King son un éxito. Esta novela se ha intentado adaptar tres veces, y sigue inédita en el cine Por qué volvemos a King. La respuesta, pese a las apariencias, no es la falta de ideas, sino que estamos ante un nombre de eficacia probada, incluso en sus peores momentos: pocos tienen ese gancho comercial aunado a unos estándares mínimos de calidad y entretenimiento. King posee más de 65 novelas y 200 relatos cortos, una mina inagotable cuyos temas no van a pasar nunca de moda y son universales: traumas generacionales, adicciones, los problemas de la clase trabajadora, amenazas invisibles, la corrupción del poder, el peso de nuestro pasado... Y como guinda, estamos en la era del IP. Así que no es una cuestión que le afecte únicamente a él. Marvel, DC, Disney.... En 2024, las diez películas más taquilleras procedían todas de propiedades intelectuales preexistentes. Y Hollywood busca familiaridad: desde las películas de Agatha Christie dirigidas por Kenneth Branagh hasta la explosión de adaptaciones de videojuegos como 'Fallout', 'The Last of Us' y 'Super Mario Bros.: La película'.

{"id":"community_social_hacker_news_bfe78f961830","title":"Show HN: I built a wizard to turn ideas into AI coding agent","content":"I created vibescaffold.dev. It is a wizard-style AI tool that will guide you from idea → vision → tech spec → implementation plan. It will generate all the documents necessary for AI coding agents to understand & iteratively execute on your vision.How it works: - Step 1: Define your product vision and MVP - Step 2: AI helps create technical architecture and data models - Step 3: Generate a staged development plan - Step 4: Create an AGENTS.md for automated workflowsI've used AI coding tools for awhile. Before this workflow (and now, this tool), I kept getting \"close but not quite\" results from AI coding tools. I learned that the more context & guidance I gave these tools up front, the better results I got.The other thing I have found with most tools that attempt to improve on \"vibe coding\" is that they add abstraction. To me, this just adds to the problem. AI coding agents are valuable, but they are error-prone - you need to be an active participation in their work. This workflow is designed to provide a scaffolding for these AI agents, while minimizing additional abstraction.Would love feedback on the workflow - especially curious if others find the upfront planning helpful or constraining.

A plataforma gera roteiros, imagens, cenas e clipes com o apoio do Gemini, além de oferecer opções simples de edição e colaboração. O que muda no Veo 3.1? Veja as novidades da IA do Google para gerar vídeos IAs para gerar vídeos: 5 diferenças entre o Veo 3 e o Sora 7 recursos para dominar o Google Vids Conheça sete recursos do Google Vids para dominar a ferramenta e gerar vídeos profissionais: Narração (que pode ser com IA); Criação de imagens com IA; Interface amigável; Organização por scripts; Modelos prontos; Animações; Gemini no Vids. 1. Narração O Google Vids é uma ferramenta que integra recursos de narração e criação visual para a produção de vídeos. Para o áudio, é possível utilizar a própria voz ou optar por locuções geradas pela IA Gemini, que produz falas claras e naturais a partir de um script. O estúdio de gravação oferece suporte manual com teleprompter e limpeza automática de ruídos. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- 2. Criação de imagens com IA No visual, o Google Vids permite criar imagens usando IA a partir de descrições de texto, gerando elementos gráficos personalizados. O modelo Veo também pode animar fotos, adicionar pequenos movimentos ou criar vídeos curtos a partir de comandos simples. No Google Vids, dá para criar vídeos com Inteligência Artificial e edições simples. (Imagem: André Magalhães/Canaltech) 3. Interface amigável O Google Vids tem uma interface simples, com linha do tempo organizada e trilhas separadas para textos, imagens e áudio. Tudo segue o padrão dos outros apps do Workspace, o que facilita a adaptação. Os controles permitem ajustar cenas, visualizar o vídeo e fazer edições sem complexidade. 4. Organização por scripts Cada cena do Vids usa um script como base e o Gemini pode sugerir textos e melhorar o roteiro, além de permitir usar o mesmo script para narração de IA ou teleprompter. 5. Modelos prontos A plataforma oferece diversos modelos prontos para acelerar a criação de vídeos. Eles já vêm com estrutura, cenas e estilo visual definidos, podendo ser personalizados com cores, fontes e logotipos. 6. Animações O Vids cria animações para destacar textos, formas e imagens, permitindo que objetos entrem ou saiam da cena com efeitos leves. Fotos estáticas também podem ganhar movimento com zoom ou panorâmica, e há recursos avançados, como rastreamento de objetos, para ajustes mais detalhados. 7. Gemini no Vids O Gemini é o principal recurso de IA do Google Vids e ajuda em quase todas as etapas do processo.

{"id":"portuguese_canaltech_1a1706b1d434","title":"Xbox 360 completa 20 anos; relembre a história do console","content":"Em 22 de novembro de 2005, chegava ao mercado o poderoso e saudoso Xbox 360. O console da Microsoft fez parte da infância e adolescência de milhões de jogadores, especialmente aqui no Brasil, onde o Xbox 360 fez um barulho imenso. 10 melhores jogos do Xbox 360 Vale a pena comprar um Xbox 360 em 2025 ou é cilada? Diferente de hoje em dia, a sétima geração da Microsoft ficou conhecida por seu foco no hardware e nos jogos, com exclusividades de peso: desde first-parties como Gears, Halo, Fable e Forza até acordos com terceiros, como BioShock, Mass Effect e The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. O Xbox 360 também foi pioneiro ao aprimorar a Xbox Live e serviços online apresentados em seu antecessor, e criar uma verdadeira cultura digital nos consoles, com funcionalidades padronizadas e utilizadas até hoje, como chat nativo, conquistas e muito mais. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Para entender todo o legado do Xbox 360, o Canaltech trouxe uma rápida recapitulação da história do melhor console que a Microsoft já lançou. Desenvolvimento do Xbox 360 Antes de entrarmos de fato no lançamento do Xbox 360, precisamos voltar ainda mais no tempo. Apesar de ter vindo ao mundo apenas em 2005, a história do console de sétima geração da Microsoft começou três anos antes. Foi em 2002 que a gigante de Redmond iniciou o desenvolvimento do Xbox 360 sob os codinomes Trinity e, posteriormente, Xenon. Neste período, os chefões da Microsoft, Bill Gates e Steve Ballmer, aprovaram uma mudança de estratégia para a próxima geração do Xbox, que naquela altura já havia vendido 3,5 milhões de unidades. Essa mudança marcou a transição de hardware do Xbox, abandonando a parceria de produção de chips com a Intel e a Nvidia e optando por seguir com a IBM e a ATI. Esta mudança foi extremamente importante para o sucesso inicial do Xbox 360. Em paralelo com a Microsoft, a IBM também estava envolvida em uma parceria com a Sony para desenvolver o superprocessador Cell, com investimento de US$ 400 milhões, sem contar custos de fabricação. O problema é que, quando a dona do Xbox contratou a empresa para desenvolver o chip para sua nova geração, a IBM usou o design central do Cell e disponibilizou os chips primeiro para a Microsoft. O Xbox 360 começou a ser desenvolvido em 2002 (Divulgação/Microsoft) Também em 2002 estreava um dos pilares da plataforma, a Xbox Live, que trouxe recursos online e foi um sucesso imediato, com mais de 80 mil assinantes em seu primeiro fim de semana. Neste período, o Xbox original sofria de alguns problemas, como o scratch gate (falha que arranhava os discos dentro do próprio console), e foi um calvário para a \"invasão verde\" em território japonês, além dos altos preços na Europa, que dificultaram na infiltração do hardware no continente. Uma das mais aclamadas desenvolvedoras da época, a Rare foi comprada pela Microsoft em um negócio de US$ 375 milhões, sendo uma importante aquisição para o futuro line-up de exclusivos da Microsoft no Xbox 360. A revelação do Xbox 360 na MTV No maior estilo anos 2000, a Microsoft apresentou o Xbox 360 oficialmente durante o programa MTV Presents em 12 de maio de 2005. O evento contou com cerca de 20 minutos e foi apresentado por uma das estrelas de O Senhor dos Anéis, Elijah Wood. O ator de O Senhor dos Anéis, Elijah Wood, apresentou o Xbox 360 em maio de 22005 (Divulgação/Microsoft) A apresentação focou no design do Xbox 360, bem como em seus recursos online e controle sem fio. Para quem curte a banda, o programa contou com uma apresentação ao vivo do The Killers e também marcou a presença de várias celebridades. Nos jogos, a Microsoft apresentou na MTV sua line-up composta por Call of Duty 2, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4, Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland, Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Gears of War e muitos outros títulos. Mais de seis meses depois, os jogadores puderam experimentar todos esses e diversos outros games. Xbox 360 chega ao mercado Em 22 de novembro de 2005, o Xbox 360 chegava ao mercado e inaugurava a sétima geração de consoles em 36 mercados. O lançamento foi uma verdadeira façanha logística e comercial da Microsoft, que claramente estava dando tudo de si para subjugar as veteranas Sony e Nintendo. Lembra do imbróglio entre IBM, Microsoft e a dona do PlayStation em torno do superprocessador Cell? Bem, além de a Microsoft conseguir chips antes da Sony, a dona do Xbox 360 contou com uma fabricante reserva, o que permitiu que a empresa contornasse problemas na produção inicial dos chips, algo que não foi feito no PlayStation 3. A icônica dashboard Blades foi a mais marcante do Xbox 360 (Divulgação/Microsoft, darkcoffeegaming) O resultado foi que o Xbox 360 chegou ao mercado um ano antes dos rivais, o que não só deixou o caminho livre para a Microsoft, como permitiu a chegada de jogos exclusivos temporários, como BioShock. Vale lembrar que, com este cenário, a gigante de Redmond também iniciou a primeira geração na era HD (720p/1080p). Tudo isso num hardware com design côncavo, botão de ligar com luzes verdes e a clássica e icônica interface Blades, que foi substituída em atualizações posteriores. Xbox 360 define os jogos online Um dos pilares do Xbox 360 foram os seus recursos online da Xbox Live, que permitiram que a Microsoft definisse este mercado nos consoles. Graças a esse ecossistema online, a empresa expandiu a cultura digital nos consoles, impulsionando jogos online e estabelecendo funcionalidades importantes até hoje, como sistemas de conquista, rankings, grupos e chats de voz nativos. Outra importante revolução foi o marketplace do Xbox 360, que redefiniu a forma com que os jogadores consumiam games. As mídias físicas ainda eram prioridade das fabricantes de consoles, mas a loja online do Xbox permitiu que os jogadores contornassem escassez e logística, permitindo comprar e baixar jogos instantaneamente. Também ajudou desenvolvedores a lançar atualizações e conteúdos adicionais de forma mais simples. Xbox Live definiu os jogos online e a forma como consumimos jogos (Divulgação/Microsoft) Falando em marketplaces, outra novidade trazida pelo Xbox 360 foi o Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA), uma iniciativa apenas para jogos digitais que fortaleceu estúdios indie ao facilitar a comercialização na plataforma. Foi dessa iniciativa que nasceram jogos como Braid, FEZ e Limbo, todos aclamados na época e considerados os pais dos títulos independentes como conhecemos hoje. Empresas maiores também fizeram uso do XBLA, como a Capcom, que trouxe um reboot do clássico Strider. Exclusividades que dão inveja no Xbox Series Se hoje a Microsoft colocou hardware e exclusividade em segundo plano, no Xbox 360 a coisa foi muito diferente. Nos primeiros anos da sétima geração, a plataforma contou com exclusivos temporários de peso, como os já citados BioShock, Mass Effect e The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, dando um gás inicial ao Xbox 360. O console também contou com jogos first-party aclamados até hoje, como Halo 3; inaugurou a série Gears, além de aprimorar séries como Fable e Forza (tanto Horizon como Motorsport). A Rare, adquirida anteriormente, ficou responsável por trazer \"experiências Nintendo\" ao Xbox 360, incluindo o saudoso Viva Piñata, e jogos para o Project Natal (falaremos mais sobre isso abaixo). Lembra que o Xbox original passou por problemas no mercado japonês? No Xbox 360, a Microsoft estava apostando muito alto e queria se infiltrar de vez no Japão. Para isso, a companhia investiu muito, fechando parceria com nomes como o criador de Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi. 10 jogos que definiram o Xbox 360 O Xbox 360 foi o período em que a marca ficou mais próxima do Japão (Divulgação/Microsoft) O Xbox 360 marcou a época mais próxima da marca no Japão, com títulos como Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon e Ninja Blade, este último desenvolvido por ninguém menos que a FromSoftware. Claro que o primeiro Xbox já havia tido certa proximidade com o mercado nipônico, visto exclusivos e system-sellers como Dead or Alive e Ninja Gaiden. A aposta no Japão se mostrou um relativo sucesso para o Xbox 360. Apesar de ficar atrás do Wii e PlayStation 3, o console da Microsoft vendeu cerca de 1,6 milhão de unidades no país, ultrapassando o Sega Mark-III (o Master System japonês). Xbox 360 explode no Brasil Lançado em 1° de dezembro de 2006 no Brasil, o Xbox 360 foi de longe o console mais popular da sétima geração ao permitir um fácil desbloqueio e, por consequência, o uso de softwares piratas, algo em que a Sony era mais restritiva. Apesar da polêmica envolvendo a prática, pirataria e videogames andaram de mãos dadas na história dos jogos no Brasil. Por isso, não era difícil encontrar o Xbox 360 em \"feiras do rolo\" e no mercado cinza, além dos jogos pirateados que podiam ser encontrados em qualquer feirinha ou loja de bairro. O Xbox 360 começou a fazer parte de muitos lares brasileiros, ao trazer uma potência absurda por preços muito mais baixos que o PlayStation 3, tudo isso impulsionado pela facilidade de desbloqueio e pirataria. Pirataria garantiu a popularidade do Xbox 360 no Brasil (Divulgação/Microsoft, Canaltech) A Microsoft também fez esforços à la Tectoy, sendo uma das primeiras grandes empresas de jogos a localizar seus títulos em português do Brasil. Cinco anos depois, a empresa trouxe a fabricação do hardware para o território nacional, barateando o Xbox 360 e tornando-o ainda mais popular entre públicos com menos poder aquisitivo. Todos esses esforços resultaram em uma popularidade que durou anos. Para se ter ideia, a Pesquisa Games Brasil 2016 revelou que o Xbox 360 era o console onde a maioria dos brasileiros jogava, apesar da oitava geração já estar no mercado há três anos. As Três Luzes Vermelhas da Morte Como nem tudo são flores, o Xbox 360 sofreu de um problema grave frequentemente relacionado a superaquecimento conhecido como as Três Luzes Vermelhas da Morte (ou 3RL), comum nas primeiras versões do console. O defeito acontecia por vários fatores, principalmente por superaquecimento que afetava componentes como CPU e GPU, mas podia ser causado por problemas de solda e ventilação, ou mesmo falhas e problemas em fonte de alimentação e placa-mãe. Três Luzes Vermelhas da Morte ou 3RL aterrorizou muitos donos do Xbox 360 (Divulgação/Microsoft) Ele era conhecido como \"Três Luzes Vermelhas da Morte\" pois, quando alguma dessas falhas acontecia, três das quatro luzes do botão de ligar do Xbox acendiam em vermelho, sinalizando que o console estava inutilizado. Ou seja, era a confirmação de que o seu Xbox 360 tinha virado um tijolo. As Três Luzes Vermelhas da Morte foi um dos maiores defeitos técnicos da história dos consoles, com estimativas de que o problema afetou modelos do Xbox 360 entre 2005 e 2008. Claro que isso custou rios de dinheiro para a Microsoft, que investiu US$ 1,15 bilhão para reverter os danos, segundo o ex-chefe da divisão Xbox, Peter Moore, em entrevistas ao IGN e Eurogamer. Kinect chega ao Xbox 360 fazendo barulho Já na segunda metade da vida do Xbox 360, a Microsoft lançaria seu Project Natal, ou mais conhecido como Kinect. A companhia prometeu muitas coisas que não foram lançadas em torno do aparelho, mas seu sucesso gritante é inegável. O Kinect foi uma resposta clara da empresa ao Wii, que, apesar de ter se distanciado do mercado de consoles de alta performance, nadou de braçada na geração, vendendo mais que o PlayStation 3 e o Xbox 360. E a resposta da Microsoft não poderia ser mais bem-sucedida. O Kinect foi uma das cartas na manga da Microsoft (Divulgação/Microsoft) Lançado em 2010, o Kinect permitia que os jogadores transformassem o corpo e a voz em controle, possibilitando jogar títulos dedicados ao dispositivo, como Just Dance e Kinect Adventures. Muitos desses jogos eram desenvolvidos pela Rare, que já havia se distanciado da produção de jogos tradicionais. Apesar de ser conhecido como uma das pedras que afundou o Xbox One, o Kinect foi um sucesso gigantesco na época, vendendo 8 milhões de unidades em apenas 60 dias e sendo reconhecido pelo Guinness como o \"Dispositivo Eletrônico de Consumo com Vendas Mais Rápidas da História\". O aparelho fechou a geração do Xbox 360 com 24 milhões de unidades comercializadas, passando em certo momento das vendas mensais do próprio Wii. Xbox 360: o melhor console da Microsoft O Xbox 360 terminou a geração atrás do PlayStation 3, apesar de seu forte início, muito influenciado pelas falhas de hardware das Três Luzes Vermelhas, mas foi por pouco. O console da Microsoft vendeu cerca de 84 milhões de unidades e deve manter o posto de hardware mais vendido pela companhia por muitos anos, visto a atual estratégia da marca. Xbox 360 é considerado por muitos como o melhor console da Microsoft (Divulgação/Microsoft) Foi no Xbox 360 que muitos dos recursos online e tendências dos jogos surgiram e se solidificaram como um padrão na indústria. O legado deixado pelo lado verde da força na sétima geração é indiscutível e fator de nostalgia para muitos fãs. Infelizmente, apesar de hoje marcar um dia festivo para o Xbox 360, é impossível não comparar com o estado atual da divisão Xbox, que parece mais perdida do que nunca. Tudo o que podemos fazer é saudar o Xbox 360 e respeitar seu legado monstruoso. Parabéns ao nosso querido 360!

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_46aee9732ddf","title":"The rise of the builder C","content":"Executives are no longer measured by the weight of their title but by the scale of what they create, especially in an era reshaped by AI. The most effective leaders now marry vision with execution, using technology as a co-pilot to accelerate outcomes while keeping human judgment at the center. Strategy isn’t declared anymore; it’s built in real time, constantly iterating and leveraging AI to turn ideas into outcomes faster than ever. The builder CEO is a visionary who architects systems, coaches teams, and removes obstacles through hands-on involvement. Here’s how executives with a builder leadership style are involved with the day-to-day work and unite teams around a shared mission. FROM VISION-SETTER TO VELOCITY ARCHITECT The builder mindset thrives where growth, technology, and disruption collide. Customers demand speed, relevance, and trust simultaneously. Meeting those demands requires leaders who are adaptive, accountable, and relentlessly driven by outcomes. Builders shorten decision loops by being present where the work happens: sprint reviews, demos, and product trade-offs. Their involvement clarifies priorities, reduces friction, and ensures strategy is lived at every level, not left on a slide deck. Stability still matters, but speed is the differentiator. Builders create systems that allow rapid testing without recklessness: guardrails, rollback plans, and clear accountabilities. They collapse silos by taking ownership of the P&L, customer outcomes, and cross-functional metrics. Marketing, product, operations, and sales work as one team because builders demand it. Builders flatten hierarchies and empower autonomy, but with accountability. Teams know exactly which calls they can make, which require escalation, and how success is measured. When a feature underperforms, the team doesn’t wait for a quarterly review. They assess metrics, test hypotheses, and implement fixes in days, not weeks. This rhythm of experimentation and fast learning ensures companies adapt in real time to customers and markets. The builder is always asking, “What can we test now?” and “What can we improve today?” BUILDERS IN AN AI-FIRST WORLD The builder archetype matters most in an AI-driven commerce environment. AI is the co-pilot bringing precision and scale, while human oversight preserves trust. Executives who design for measurement, keep human judgment where it counts, and integrate AI thoughtfully create enduring advantage. The best builders set a single customer outcome as the north star, participate directly in product reviews, require every experiment to have guardrails, and assign clear ownership for cross-functional work. They standardize where possible but keep space for human judgment where it drives value. AI, in their hands, is not a replacement but an amplifier, removing repetitive work so teams can focus on judgment, creativity, and engagement. This balance accelerates both growth and employee buy-in. THE HUMAN CORE OF BUILDING Builders aren’t flawless. Over-involvement can slip into micromanagement, while too much autonomy without boundaries breeds chaos. The remedy is clarity: metrics, cadence, and transparent ownership. Most importantly, builders lead with humanity. They celebrate wins, fail fast, and then mine failures for lessons, and ensure every team member understands the impact of their work. They know speed without trust is brittle, and systems without people are hollow. The modern C-suite is no longer judged by how many strategies it produces but by the outcomes it builds and the speed with which it learns. In an era defined by complexity and constant change, the builder mindset is the defining quality of leadership. The leaders who shape the next decade will be those with builder DNA.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_41da24f64156","title":"Why teams stop developing—and how to get them moving again","content":"IT development has been around for more than 60 years and it has undergone radical transformations from the emergence of the first programming languages and OS development to the internet boom and the current AI era. Although programming tools and approaches are constantly changing, one thing remains constant: Only those developers who can adapt and master new knowledge and skills survive. I’m the chief software officer of a 70-strong team that designs a predictive maintenance system (PdM): A solution based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and AI. Without continuous growth, our developers cannot remain competitive. The same is true in nearly every industry; when individuals stop working on their skills, a company can lose its edge. Here’s a look at how we have created a system where professional development is an integral part of the work and how we help developers avoid and overcome stagnation. MUST EVERYONE GROW? Every team has specialists who prefer routine work, and to some extent teams need those people who do well in a position that does not require growth. But for a project to develop steadily, I believe such experts should not exceed 20% of the team. If their share is higher, other developers will eventually start to emulate their passive colleagues. Optimally, the majority—about 80%—should be actively developing and improving their expertise. Not everyone in the 80% needs to generate new ideas. The driver-to-performer ratio depends on the company’s development stage. A start-up needs 80% drivers because they’re the ones who forge ahead. Conversely, in mature companies, sustainable quality leads require constant hard-skill honing rather than a fountain of ideas. DEVELOPMENT THROUGH SMALL ACTIONS Encouraging developers to advance their skills can start small. For example, one underrated tool is having a person write tests to check their code, which is mandatory for everyone on our team, including senior specialists. Many teams use code reviews more often than writing tests. But when a developer writes a test, they may find that their method or function is too cumbersome, with many exceptions and dependencies, and it’s almost impossible to test it entirely. As a result, they begin redesigning their code and look for solutions to improve its logic. They study additional materials, such as technical blogs and best-practice guides, and consult with colleagues to deepen their expertise. However, tests have limitations. Once a person learns patterns, writes tests quickly and confidently, growth stops and routine begins. This tempts developers to automate their work. CASE-BY-CASE APPROACH There are many reasons why professionals pause in their development. They may be satisfied with their position/skills, bored, or facing challenging external circumstances. For example, most of our developers are Ukrainian, and our work has been affected by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has been a great stress to everyone. Team members have responded differently—approximately 30% lost their motivation to do anything, and another 30% have taken a deep dive into their development. One strong junior immersed himself so deeply in his studies that in just six months, he mastered senior level theory. The rest simply adapted and returned to their usual pace. After 10+ years in tech management, I realized that everyone has different motivations for advancing their skills. Your task is not to pressure them but to understand what is holding them back and what incentivizes them. Some practices that I’ve found helpful when developers stagnate are: Provide new context. Offer the developer an opportunity to work on another project or change domains. A new environment presents new challenges, requires adaptation, and learning. Present challenges. Give the developer a task that requires creative thinking and independent research. Don’t provide an answer. This will let them take initiative and responsibility for the result. Encourage learning. If a person seeks development opportunities provide them with resources. For example, compensate for conference or workshop participation. Adjust expectations. Sometimes a person is satisfied with their expertise. In this case, it’s important to agree: If the developer doesn’t want growth, they don’t seek promotion. Each specialist must have their own development plan. We draw it up twice a year, based on in-depth assessment. We set goals that meet the company’s expectations and the developer’s interests. THE COMPANY’S SYSTEMATIC APPROACH In my experience, developers often stop focusing on advancing their skills when they are overloaded. After intense work, they no longer have the energy to learn. Learning by working is our main principle. We believe developers can improve their skills through hands-on experience, so we integrate this approach into employee development plans. Daily: Giving them a short technical digest and work with code through tests and reviews. Two-week sprints: Each sprint includes two to three days when a developer can try a new approach, technology, etc. Once a month: Internal clubs— sessions in each department lasting one hour to 90 minutes where they can share experiences, run practical workshops, and exchange best practices. Once every three to six months: Three-hour sessions with external speakers, advanced training. FINAL THOUGHTS I’m convinced that development begins with dialogue. You should understand what motivates a person. I also believe that there are no wrong decisions—only different points of view. Developers shouldn’t be afraid to disagree because critical thinking and constructive discussion always help team growth.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_871254c489b3","title":"Selling to machines: How AI will change e","content":"How did you get to this article? Maybe you opened a link in an email, or you navigated from the Fast Company home page. Perhaps you Googled “agentic AI” and this figured in the results. The point is, you almost certainly clicked, scrolled, tapped, or typed your way here, because that’s the digital grammar that shapes nearly every online experience. But that 30-year-old paradigm is about to change. Agentic AI is ripping up the rulebook, by creating a new layer of intelligent, autonomous mediation between us and the digital world. Personal shopping agents will handle routine purchases, while in the workplace, agents will automate workflows and streamline procurement. Investors are excited, of course. Earlier this year, more than half of the Y Combinator startups chosen for its accelerator program were working in agentic, while the three biggest Q1 acquisitions in the AI sector involved companies building agentic enterprise technologies. This is because agents are about to transform how work gets done, how businesses operate, and how systems interact. And nowhere are the consequences more profound than in e-commerce. CLICKLESS COMMERCE Today, e-commerce success depends on online visibility, with search driving half of website traffic and fuelling the $75 billion search engine optimization (SEO) industry. But agentic AI upends the traditional business model. For agents, displays and brand content are less important. Merchants must focus on making product data machine-legible—accurate, structured, and accessible—because machines won’t browse sites. They’ll connect directly to sales platforms and databases via APIs, creating a parallel e-commerce track that serves agents rather than human shoppers. Building out that machine track will be a critical job for merchants, fintechs, software companies, and financial institutions. For merchants, an early task is compiling and structuring data in a way that’s visible and relevant to agents. Another is creating seamless connections between merchant systems and agent systems. The good news is that the connective tissue is already here. New protocols—model context, agent-to-agent, and agentic payments—now enable agents to connect, communicate, and transact autonomously. MARKETING TO MACHINES: A NEW INDUSTRY For retailers, one question looms: How do I market to machines? As SEO evolves for human audiences, new disciplines are emerging to optimize digital environments for AI agents. Agent engine optimization helps make digital spaces easier for agents to understand and use. Agent interaction design focuses on how they communicate with platforms, APIs, and other agents to get things done for users. These areas connect with generative engine optimization, which improves content so AI systems can better generate recommendations and make decisions. Taken together, they signal a new ecosystem—one that will create fresh roles, unlock new value streams, and redefine how businesses compete in an AI-driven economy. Another way of attracting machine buyers is to reward them. This is the agentic version of e-commerce’s affiliate system, where publishers, partners, and influencers are paid a commission for driving sales. There’s feverish speculation as to how an attribution mechanism may work, and who will get paid. There are plenty of challenges too—not least verifying agents’ identities, knowing with confidence which agent influenced the sale, and preventing fake agents from gaming the system. But the opportunities are apparent. The affiliate market is predicted to double in size by 2030, even without agents. FACE THE HEADWINDS Certain issues will require regulatory clarity. Agentic referral will have to be transparent, for example, to ensure fair competition. Then there’s the matter of trust. We’ll need confidence in the agents and the ecosystems they operate in. Giving an autonomous bot spending authority is a big commitment, but getting it right is key to scaling agentic commerce. Ensuring agents can operate across different payment systems, platforms, and legal jurisdictions will also pose technical and regulatory challenges. That said, we’re about to experience the biggest transformation in e-commerce since it began. This promises to be an era of great innovation—a time to build new tools, new ecosystems, and new ways of creating value. Agentic commerce isn’t just a tech shift; it’s a reimagining of how we buy, sell, and connect in a digital world.
