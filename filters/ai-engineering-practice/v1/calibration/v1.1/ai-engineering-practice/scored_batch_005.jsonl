The Scene Every Cloud Architect Knows Too Well Its Friday evening. Youve just wrapped up a solid week of architecture reviews and CI/CD firefighting. Then suddenlyPagerDuty pings. Your AI-powered deployment validator has failed again. The LLM was supposed to summarise an Azure App Service deployment manifest. Instead, it choked on a 19KB JSON blob and replied: I cannot process this PowerPoint file. You check the logs. The JSON blob fed into the LLM has: 42 services 118 policy rules 7 nested objects spelling doom And a token bill that could fund a small island nation Meanwhile, your FinOps team messages you: Why did one prompt consume 18,432 tokens?! Just as you stare into the void, contemplating a career in the tea-making business TOON walks in quietly. Like a minimalist samurai. Ready to solve your token trauma. Meet TOONToken-Oriented Object Notation A compact, human-readable, LLM-friendly format designed for the AI era. TOON is what happens when JSON goes to coding bootcamp, takes minimalism seriously, and stops hoarding punctuation. Its designed to serialise structured data in a way that LLMs understand more easilyusing fewer tokens and with fewer hallucinations. If JSON is a 20-page resume, TOON is the clean 1-page CV that actually gets read. Why TOON Matters (Especially If You Live in the Cloud) LLMs struggle with noisy punctuation, long prompts, deeply nested brackets, and repeated field names. TOON fixes that by: Removing unnecessary syntax Flattening repetitive structures Compressing arrays into tabular form Reducing token count by 3060% For engineers dealing with: API specs Kubernetes manifests Azure Bicep outputs CI/CD summaries Observability logs TOON becomes an instant superpower. Few Cloud & DevOps Examples ExampleKubernetes Pod Health Summary JSON { \"namespace\": \"prod\", \"pods\": [ { \"name\": \"web-7f984d\", \"status\": \"Running\", \"restarts\": 1 }, { \"name\": \"payments-4f29d1\", \"status\": \"CrashLoopBackOff\", \"restarts\": 5 } ] } TOON namespace: prod pods[2]{name,status,restarts}: web-7f984d,Running,1 payments-4f29d1,CrashLoopBackOff,5 Example 2 Observability Metrics (from official TOON benchmarks) JSON (5 rows) { \"metrics\": [ { \"date\": \"2025-01-01\", \"views\": 5715, \"clicks\": 211, \"conversions\": 28, \"revenue\": 7976.46, \"bounceRate\": 0.47 } ] } TOON metrics[5]{date,views,clicks,conversions,revenue,bounceRate}: 2025-01-01,5715,211,28,7976.46,0.47 ... Perfect for telemetry, Grafana streams, log analysis, and dashboards. When Should You Use TOON? (Straight from the Spec) Use TOON When: Your data is mostly flat or semi-flat Youre sending structured data to an LLM You want to reduce token costs You need to handle large arrays of similar objects Youre feeding logs, metrics, or infra configs to an AI agent Avoid TOON When: Your structure is deeply nested (complex trees, recursive objects) You need strong schema validation Youre interacting with APIs expecting strict JSON Your data has highly irregular shapes A good rule: If JSON looks like a mazekeep JSON. If JSON looks like a spreadsheetuse TOON. TOON vs JSON vs YAMLDeveloper Cage Match | Feature | JSON | YAML | TOON | | Readability | Good | Great | Excellent | | Token Efficiency | Meh | Better | 🔥 Best | | LLM Accuracy | Decent | Moderate | Highest | | Human Happiness | Medium | Low (indentation PTSD) | High | | Ideal Use | APIs | Configs | AI prompts | Installation & Quick Start (Developers Love This Part) CLI (no installation required) npx @toon-format/cli input.json -o output.toon Pipe from stdin echo '{\"name\":\"Ada\"}' | npx @toon-format/cli Library (TypeScript) npm install @toon-format/toon Usage import { encode } from '@toon-format/toon'; console.log(encode({ users: [ {id: 1, name: 'Alice'}, {id: 2, name: 'Bob'} ] })); Final ThoughtsThe Future Is TOON-Shaped TOON isnt just another data format. Its a practical upgrade for anyone using LLMs in Cloud or DevOps. It reduces token costs. It improves AI accuracy. It removes JSON noise. It cleans up your prompts. And most importantly It gives your AI agents a fighting chance to understand your infrastructure. Try converting one of your ugly JSON prompts today. Your LLMand your token billwill thank you.

{"id":"bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology_2cec411fad54","title":"Comparative safety profile of levofloxacin versus moxifloxacin in first","content":"ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare the safety profiles of two fluoroquinolone-containing regimens, HREL (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, levofloxacin) and HREM (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, moxifloxacin), in the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB), focusing on adverse events (AEs) across age and gender subgroups.MethodsData were extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database (2004–2024). Disproportionality analyses were conducted to assess AE signals for HREL and HREM. Pharmacovigilance metrics, including reporting odds ratios (RORs), proportional reporting ratios (PRRs), Bayesian confidence propagation neural networks (BCPNN), and empirical Bayesian geometric means (EBGMs), were calculated. Subgroup analyses were stratified by age (≥60 vs. <60 years) and gender.ResultsThe analysis included 451 HREL-related and 338 HREM-related AEs. HREL was associated with a significantly higher risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS-TB) and drug-induced liver injury, particularly in females and patients under 60 years of age. In contrast, HREM demonstrated a higher risk of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), peripheral neuropathy, and severe hepatobiliary events such as acute liver failure. Subgroup analyses revealed that these risk profiles were influenced by age and gender. Specifically, elderly patients (≥60 years) receiving HREM had a lower risk of IRIS-TB but a higher propensity for severe liver injury. Male patients treated with HREM showed an increased risk of neurological events, including thalamic infarction.ConclusionHREM may be preferred for elderly patients (≥60 years) due to a lower risk of immune-related events like IRIS-TB, but requires careful liver monitoring. HREL could be an option for younger patients (<60 years), though vigilance for hepatotoxicity and IRIS-TB is needed, especially in females. For males on HREM, increased attention to neurological AEs is recommended.","source":"bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1713170","published_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-21T06:43:30.419138","language":"en","tags":["phytochemistry","pharmacology","plant-based-pharma","biocentre-core","drug-discovery","original_research","bioinformatics"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers

{"id":"bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology_510b47441321","title":"Preclinical pharmacokinetic characterization of (R)","content":"IntroductionKetamine is a significant class of antidepressant drugs, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of its enantiomers exhibit differences. Among them, intravenous infusion of (R)-ketamine can effectively alleviate depressive symptoms in patients, offering the advantages of prolonged duration of action and minimal side effects. The extensive preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of (R)-ketamine were conducted to support its further development.MethodsThis study investigated the preclinical pharmacokinetic behavior of (R)-ketamine across different dose groups through single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs, along with tissue distribution studies in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.In vitro metabolism study using microsomes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans were conducted to evaluate metabolic stability and obtain metabolite profiles. The excretion studies in rats (7.5 mg/kg dose group) were performed to elucidate the primary elimination pathways of (R)-ketamine. The allometric scaling approach was employed to predict human plasma total clearance based on preclinical data.Results(R)-ketamine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics in SD rats and Beagle dogs, with plasma exposure increasing disproportionately to dose after both single and multiple intravenous administrations. The highest tissue exposure to (R)-Ketamine was found in the fat and kidney of the rats. The (R)-ketamine concentration ratio of brain/plasma was 2.25 for the rats, indicating effective blood-brain barrier penetration and significant brain distribution of (R)-ketamine. (R)-ketamine undergoes rapid metabolism in liver microsomes from mice, rats, dogs, monkeys and humans. The predominant metabolite identified in human, monkey and mice liver microsomes was (R)-norketamine and demethylated and mono-oxidized metabolites in rats and dogs. (R)-ketamine is primarily excreted via bile, accounting for 3.613% of the dose within 72 h, significantly higher than in feces (0.327%) or urine (0.030%). The main elimination pathway may be metabolic elimination, and eventually excreted in the form of metabolites. The predicted human plasma total clearance of 29.93 mL/min/kg is close to reported value.ConclusionThe preclinical pharmacokinetic characteristics of (R)-ketamine injection have been thoroughly investigated, and these findings can provide valuable information for predicting the first-in-human dose and designing Phase I clinical trials for (R)-ketamine injection.","source":"bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1699304","published_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-21T06:43:30.420823","language":"en","tags":["phytochemistry","pharmacology","plant-based-pharma","biocentre-core","drug-discovery","original_research","bioinformatics"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers

Before the abstraction of government fiat or cryptocurrency, value was stored in things that required real work and resources, bushels of grain, livestock, gold, assets with their own direct productive output: horses, and tragically, slaves. These were the foundational assets of economies, representing a direct link between labor, resources, and stored value. As we accelerate into an all-electric, all-digital age, this fundamental link is re-emerging, but with a new unit of account. The 21st-century economy, defined by automated industry, robotic, electric transport, and now power-hungry artificial intelligence, runs on a single, non-negotiable input: electricity.

{"id":"positive_news_upworthy_7b02233a8a70","title":"Astrophotographer captures incredible real photo of skydiver falling in front of the sun","content":"With artificial intelligence being used to \"create\" images left and right in 2025, the art of photography has become even more relevant. Human-created art has always held value, and when someone creates something incredible through skill, talent, and effort, it will always be more valuable than AI-generated fakery. Case in point: \"The Fall of Icarus.\" Astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy and friend Gabriel Brown created a photo of a skydiver falling in front of the sun entirely from their knowledge of astrophotography and physics. The final product is a remarkable, one-of-its-kind photo anyone would be hard-pressed to recreate. Gabriel Brown skydives in front of the sun in \"The Fall of Icarus\" by astrophotographer Andrew McCarthy.Courtesy of Andrew McCarthy \"Immense planning and technical precision was required for this absolutely preposterous (but real) view: I captured my friend @BlackGryph0n [Gabriel Brown] transiting the sun during a skydive,\" McCarthy wrote on X. \"This might be the first photo of it's kind in existence.\"McCarthy shared that Brown did the calculations after the idea came to them while skydiving together. Brown shared a video of the moment the shot was taken as he jumped from a small propeller-powered craft and described the preparation that went into creating the moment and capturing it in a photo on Instagram: See on Instagram \"We had to find the right location, time, aircraft, and distance for the clearest shot; while factoring in the aircraft’s power-off glideslope for the optimal sun angle and safe exit altitude. Then we had to align the shot using the opposition effect from the aircraft (shout out to the pilot @jimhamberlin) and coordinate the exact moment of the jump on 3-way comms!\"As if that wasn’t hard enough, we had a myriad of malfunctions that almost led to the shot not being captured… But as you can see, against all odds, we got it on the sixth try!\"Naturally, people have questions about how McCarthy got such interesting details in the sun. McCarthy explained that he kept shooting the sun after Brown cleared the frame and used that data to create a stacked image. — (@) \"When capturing the sun through these telescopes, repeated exposures are needed to eliminate atmospheric turbulence and sensor noise,\" McCarthy explained on X. \"Every single astrophoto is a stacked photo, it’s necessary to overcome atmospheric limitations and sensor noise. Not the same as compositing, which is artificially combining two images from different scenes.\"But capturing the details of the sun wasn't the challenge here. McCarthy has been doing astrophotography for a long time. It was capturing the skydiver that made it a challenge. Brown was a little over two miles away from McCarthy shooting the image, and of course the sun behind him about 93 million miles away. McCarthy had to know exactly how to set up the equipment and they had to time everything out just right in order to get the image they were looking for. See on Instagram McCarthy's other space photography is worth a look as well. He recently captured a gorgeous shot of a supermoon with colorful details we can't see with the naked eye. \"Last night I captured over 60k photos of the largest supermoon of the year using two telescopes to reveal the hidden color in 119 megapixels,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"I call the print 'Artemis Beckons,' after the next crewed lunar mission. These colors are there naturally on the moon—they’re just so faint you can’t really pick them out. When thousands of photos are stacked together, the fidelity of the image allows them to be drawn out.\"The blue color on the moon is titanium, he shared in the comments: \"The moon isn’t gray, but *slightly* colorful based on mineral composition.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_0a5a6c3db583","title":"The billion","content":"As startups race to keep up with advances in artificial intelligence, some of them seem to be borrowing from China’s exacting work culture—which normalized a 72-hour workweek, or a “996” schedule of working six days a week from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. While the 996 parlance and laser focus on AI may be new, hustle culture has always been embedded in Silicon Valley to some degree. Some business leaders, perhaps most famously Elon Musk, have long demanded those hours from their employees: “There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week,” he once said of the “hardcore” work ethic promoted at his companies. Now that culture seems to be seeping into more and more workplaces, as young founders and tech workers try to capitalize on the rise of AI. The CEO of the $10 billion AI startup Cognition has talked openly about the intense work ethic expected at his company. “Cognition has an extreme performance culture, and we’re up front about this in hiring so there are no surprises later,” he shared on X earlier this year. “We routinely are at the office through the weekend and do some of our best work late into the night. Many of us literally live where we work.” In this environment, Karri Saarinen—an early employee at Coinbase and the former principal designer at Airbnb—has sought to do things differently. Saarinen founded Linear, an AI-powered enterprise software company, in 2019. It was well before the pandemic, but Saarinen believed it was important to lean into remote work—not just because Linear was creating tools for companies to use remotely for project management and product development, but also because the founders did not want to get stuck in Silicon Valley for the foreseeable future. “We honestly asked ourselves: Do we want to do a company here for the next 10 or 20 years? And we decided no,” Saarinen says. Linear has raised $82 million this year—spiking its valuation to more than a billion dollars. It boasts high-profile clients like OpenAI and Perplexity. And it’s done so without blindly embracing the hustle culture spouted by people like Musk. Avoiding an unsustainable pace In spite of this success, Saarinen says he has tried to be deliberate in his approach to building Linear, rather than cave to the pressure so many companies seem to feel amid the rapid clip of AI innovation. (It likely also helps that Linear has been profitable for four years, per Saarinen.) The tone of corporate messaging on AI, both from tech giants and smaller startups, has been that the technology is moving fast—and their employees need to step up to meet the moment. In a memo earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noted that the company was already using generative AI in nearly every part of the business, but that Amazon was “still at the relative beginning” and should move faster. “We’re going to keep pushing to operate like the world’s largest startup—customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy, and full of missionaries trying to build something better for customers and a business that outlasts us all,” he wrote. (Jassy also explicitly said AI adoption would necessitate job cuts, though he has denied the recent layoffs at Amazon were due to AI.) Other Big Tech companies have also tied AI strategy to breakneck speed and a potentially draining work culture. At Meta, senior leaders have called for employees to “go 5x faster” by using AI. “Our goal is simple yet audacious: Make Al a habit, not a novelty,” Metaverse VP Vishal Shah wrote in an internal message, per a 404 Media report. “This means prioritizing training and adoption for everyone, so that using Al becomes second nature—just like any other tool we rely on.” Shah added, “We expect 80% of Metaverse employees to have integrated AI into their daily work routines by the end of this year.” Meta has also invested billions of dollars in hiring—and poaching—top AI talent. Saarinen understands why company leaders feel like they need to move fast, but he argues the pace is likely not sustainable, noting that the current AI race “is not going to end after this year. It will probably go for the next decade. So are you going to race that whole next decade?” As a founder, Saarinen says there can be an impulse to emulate other successful companies or keep up with peers, regardless of what might be best for your own company. “I think a lot of this pressure is somewhat self-created,” he says. “I don’t know if it’s even real. Companies are so focused on what all the other companies are doing, so they’re trying to build the same things or catch up to everyone.” Taking time for test runs Linear has intentionally taken a slower approach to growing its ranks, in stark contrast to the companies offering huge sums of money to out-hire their competitors. The company has more or less doubled its headcount each year and now employs about 80 people. “At Coinbase, I was [maybe] the 12th person there,” Saarinen says. “And then in a year, there were like 60 people. Now most of the people around you are new and have been there a very short time. I think it can be useful, and it’s exciting [when] a company is growing fast. But there are a lot of situations where it gets quite chaotic, and the culture kind of suffers.” A core part of its hiring process is what the company calls a work trial. Once a candidate gets to the final stage of the interview process at Linear, they are invited to participate in a paid trial period—typically two to five days—when they are tasked with working on a real project alongside employees at the company. It’s a feature that adds friction to the hiring process but helps the company understand whether someone will be a good fit. Sometimes it’s a differentiator that pushes a candidate to accept a job at Linear over other offers; in other instances, it has weeded out people who did not want to commit to a work trial. “The aim is trying to simulate the real working relationship as much as possible,” Saarinen says. “We can obviously see how the person gets things done, but also: What is their thinking style? What’s their communication style? For the candidate, I think it’s also a good way to know if they want to work in this company.” It can also help determine, for example, whether engineers are looking for a job where they are told what to do, or if they are interested in taking more ownership of their work, as is the norm at Linear. “People should have some life outside of work” The work trial and other atypical elements of Linear’s culture have helped attract people who are not interested in the endless grind of working at some of the hottest AI companies. Linear has had very little attrition, according to Saarinen, and the company usually tries to promote from within. Saarinen also firmly believes that the quality of work is compromised when you work people to the bone. “That quality piece that we value the most—we think that doesn’t happen if you just keep pushing people harder and harder,” he says. “People should have some life outside of work. They should get inspired by their life, and then hopefully that will kind of bleed into the work as well. If you just feel better, then I think the work you do is a little better.” He hopes that Linear might offer a counterexample to tech workers who are building companies in the AI space at this particular juncture. “I want to show other founders that you can also do things differently,” he says. “You don’t always have to do what everyone else is doing. I think that’s kind of what is happening in the market, that everyone is hearing this story: ‘Those guys work really hard, so I must do it as well.’ And maybe it makes sense for you—or maybe it doesn’t.”","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91445544/the-1-25-billion-ai-startup-that-rejects-hustle-culture","published_date":"2025-11-21T09:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-21T12:55:28.253356","language":"en","tags":["business","technology","leadership","innovation"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast

{"id":"community_social_hackernews_newest_9a041d618156","title":"Show HN: GuardiAgent – Sandboxing / permission model for MCP servers","content":"Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) has made it easy to spin up servers that expose tools and data to LLMs.A lot of these MCP servers run locally because they need access to your files, shell, browser, etc. The problem: they typically run with the same privileges as your user. If a server is buggy, misconfigured, or prompt-injected, it can do anything you can do: read SSH keys, exfiltrate dotfiles, poke around in private repos, etc.Our research group is working on this by adding a security manifest (inspired by the Android app manifest) plus a local policy enforcement engine that sandbox MCP servers. You can specify which hosts they can reach, which files/directories they can read/write, and so on, instead of giving them full user-level access.Code and docs: https://github.com/orgs/GuardiAgent/repositories https://www.guardiagent.comCurious how others are locking down agents/tools today and what you'd want from a system like this.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_dc7b1e77bdad","title":"Building a Technical Blog with Astro + Cloudflare","content":"Building a Technical Blog with Astro + Cloudflare This blog is built using Astro 5 and Cloudflare's edge computing technology. Here's how to build a fast and scalable blog system from scratch. Tech Stack Frontend Astro 5 - Static site generator with Content Collections support MDX - Markdown + React components Tailwind CSS 4 - Utility-first CSS framework Backend & Infrastructure Cloudflare Workers - Serverless runtime at the edge Cloudflare Durable Objects - Globally distributed state management Why This Stack? 1. Performance Astro's partial hydration loads JavaScript only where needed Cloudflare's global edge network provides low-latency access worldwide Static generation ensures fast initial page loads 2. Scalability Durable Objects enable serverless state management (view counts, likes) Pay-as-you-go pricing scales from small to large 3. Developer Experience MDX allows embedding components in articles Astro's Content Collections provide type-safe content management Tailwind CSS 4's new CSS variable-based design system Interactive Features One of the key features of this blog is the interactive like button with smooth animations. When users click the like button, they see: Heart bounce animation - The heart icon scales up and bounces (0.6s) Count-up animation - The like count fades in from below (0.4s) Button feedback - The button briefly shrinks on click (0.15s) Color transition - The heart changes to red with a smooth transition The like system uses localStorage to track user interactions (up to 10 likes per article) and Durable Objects to persist the total count globally. The blog listing page uses a batch API to fetch stats for all posts in a single request, and bot detection prevents crawlers from inflating view counts. This creates a delightful user experience while maintaining simplicity and performance.

Create Project Generate the initial project structure using Astro's official CLI. npm create astro@latest shusukedev-blog cd shusukedev-blog 2. Install Dependencies Add Cloudflare Workers deployment, MDX support, Tailwind CSS styling, type definitions, and build tools. npm install @astrojs/cloudflare @astrojs/mdx @astrojs/sitemap npm install @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss npm install -D @cloudflare/workers-types esbuild Package roles: @astrojs/cloudflare - Adapter for Cloudflare Workers deployment @astrojs/mdx - MDX (Markdown + JSX) support @astrojs/sitemap - Automatic sitemap.xml generation for SEO @tailwindcss/vite - Tailwind CSS Vite plugin @cloudflare/workers-types - TypeScript type definitions (dev only) esbuild - Transpile Durable Objects (dev only) 3. Astro Configuration Define Astro's behavior including MDX, Sitemap, Tailwind CSS integrations, and Cloudflare Workers deployment settings. astro.config.mjs: import { defineConfig } from \"astro/config\"; import mdx from \"@astrojs/mdx\"; import tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\"; import cloudflare from \"@astrojs/cloudflare\"; import sitemap from \"@astrojs/sitemap\"; export default defineConfig({ site: \"https://shusukedev.com\", integrations: [mdx(), sitemap()], vite: { plugins: [tailwindcss()], }, adapter: cloudflare(), }); 4. Define Content Collections Schema Define type-safe schema for blog post frontmatter (metadata). This enables type checking and editor autocomplete when writing articles. src/content/config.ts: import { defineCollection, z } from \"astro:content\"; const blog = defineCollection({ type: \"content\", schema: z.object({ title: z.string(), description: z.string(), pubDate: z.coerce.date(), updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional(), tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]), draft: z.boolean().default(false), }), }); export const collections = { blog }; 5. Implement Durable Objects Implement backend logic to persist view counts and likes for each article. Durable Objects is Cloudflare's globally distributed state management service. src/durable-objects/ViewCounter.ts: export interface Env { VIEW_COUNTER: DurableObjectNamespace; } interface CounterData { views: number; likes: number; } export class ViewCounter { state: DurableObjectState; env: Env; constructor(state: DurableObjectState, env: Env) { this.state = state; this.env = env; } async fetch(request: Request): Promise { const url = new URL(request.url); const path = url.pathname; try { if (path === \"/views\" && request.method === \"POST\") { return await this.incrementViews(); } if (path === \"/likes\" && request.method === \"POST\") { return await this.incrementLikes(); } if (path === \"/stats\" && request.method === \"GET\") { return await this.getStats(); } return new Response(\"Not Found\", { status: 404 }); } catch (error) { console.error(\"Durable Object fetch error:\", error); return new Response(\"Internal Server Error\", { status: 500 }); } } private async incrementViews(): Promise { const data = await this.getData(); data.views++; await this.state.storage.put(\"data\", data); return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } private async incrementLikes(): Promise { const data = await this.getData(); data.likes++; await this.state.storage.put(\"data\", data); return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } private async getStats(): Promise { const data = await this.getData(); return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } private async getData(): Promise { const stored = await this.state.storage.get(\"data\"); return stored || { views: 0, likes: 0 }; } } 6. Cloudflare Configuration Define Cloudflare Workers deployment settings and Durable Objects bindings. This allows Workers to recognize the ViewCounter class and make it available via API. wrangler.jsonc: { \"main\": \"dist/_worker.js/index.js\", \"name\": \"shusukedev-blog\", \"workers_dev\": false, \"compatibility_date\": \"2025-11-18\", \"compatibility_flags\": [\"nodejs_compat\", \"global_fetch_strictly_public\"], \"assets\": { \"binding\": \"ASSETS\", \"directory\": \"./dist\" }, \"observability\": { \"enabled\": true }, \"durable_objects\": { \"bindings\": [ { \"name\": \"VIEW_COUNTER\", \"class_name\": \"ViewCounter\", \"script_name\": \"shusukedev-blog\" } ] }, \"migrations\": [ { \"tag\": \"v1\", \"new_sqlite_classes\": [\"ViewCounter\"] } ] } 7. API Endpoints Create API routes to communicate with Durable Objects. These endpoints handle view count increments and statistics retrieval for each blog post. src/pages/api/views/[slug].ts: import type { APIRoute } from \"astro\"; export const prerender = false; export const POST: APIRoute = async ({ params, locals }) => { const { slug } = params; if (!slug) { return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Slug is required\" }), { status: 400, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } try { const id = locals.runtime.env.VIEW_COUNTER.idFromName(slug); const stub = locals.runtime.env.VIEW_COUNTER.get(id); const response = await stub.fetch(\"http://internal/views\", { method: \"POST\", }); const data = await response.json(); return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { status: 200, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } catch (error) { console.error(\"Failed to increment views:\", error); return new Response( JSON.stringify({ error: \"Failed to increment views\" }), { status: 500, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, } ); } }; export const GET: APIRoute = async ({ params, locals }) => { const { slug } = params; if (!slug) { return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Slug is required\" }), { status: 400, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } try { const id = locals.runtime.env.VIEW_COUNTER.idFromName(slug); const stub = locals.runtime.env.VIEW_COUNTER.get(id); const response = await stub.fetch(\"http://internal/stats\"); const data = await response.json(); return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { status: 200, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } catch (error) { console.error(\"Failed to get stats:\", error); return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: \"Failed to get stats\" }), { status: 500, headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }, }); } }; 8. Create Blog Posts Write blog content using MDX format. MDX allows you to use JSX components within Markdown, enabling interactive elements and rich content. src/content/blog/example.mdx: --- title: \"Post Title\" description: \"Post description\" pubDate: 2025-11-20 tags: [\"astro\", \"cloudflare\"] draft: false --- # Heading Write your content here. ## Code Blocks \\`\\`\\`typescript const greeting = \"Hello, World!\"; console.log(greeting); \\`\\`\\` ## Embed Components import CustomComponent from \"../../components/CustomComponent.astro\"; Deployment Local Development npm run dev Build npm run build Deploy to Cloudflare Workers npx wrangler deploy Or use GitHub Actions for automatic deployment: Set up Cloudflare API token in GitHub Secrets Configure GitHub Actions workflow Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment Design Refinement with Claude Code Building a blog isn't just about functionality—design matters. I used Claude Code as my design partner throughout the development process. This approach was inspired by Anthropic's article on improving frontend design through skills. The article highlights a key challenge: LLMs tend to generate generic, \"safe\" designs. By leveraging Claude Code's design expertise, I avoided the typical \"AI-generated\" aesthetic. Avoiding Generic Design Patterns Instead of accepting Claude's initial suggestions, I asked it to critique and refine the design across multiple dimensions: Typography Moved away from default system fonts Chose JetBrains Mono for headings to create a distinctive, technical identity Used Inter for body text to maintain readability while feeling modern Applied negative letter-spacing (-0.02em) to headings for a tighter, more professional look Color System Requested a cohesive grayscale-based palette rather than generic color schemes Added sharp blue accents (blue-600 in light mode, blue-400 in dark mode) for focus and interaction Ensured WCAG AA compliance for text contrast in both themes Layout & Spacing Established a consistent vertical rhythm with proportional spacing (1.25em - 2em) Limited content width to 896px for optimal readability (60-70 characters per line) Created clear visual hierarchy through spacing rather than heavy borders Dark Mode with Context-Aware Design Claude Code helped implement dark mode that feels intentional, not just an inverted color scheme: Prevented FOUC with an inline script checking localStorage and prefers-color-scheme Subtle borders (gray-200 → gray-800) that define sections without overwhelming the design Adjusted code block backgrounds for better syntax highlighting in dark mode Result The final design avoids common AI-generated patterns while maintaining clean, professional aesthetics. It feels purposeful rather than generic—exactly what the Claude Skills blog post advocates for.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_04c31e6ed286","title":"How to Compress Your Prompts and Reduce LLM Costs","content":"Microsoft just solved the hidden cost problem in AI with LLMLingua, making large language models faster, cheaper, and smarter. Every developer working with large language models eventually faces the same challenge. Prompts keep getting longer, models keep getting slower, and API bills keep getting higher. Whether you’re building a retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) system or a chatbot that remembers past conversations, every extra token adds cost and latency. Microsoft quietly introduced a fix that few people outside research circles noticed, with a project called LLMLingua. It compresses prompts before sending them to a model, keeping only the most important information. The result is faster responses, smaller bills, and an easier path to scaling LLMs. In this tutorial, we will look at how to use LLM Lingua to optimze our prompts and make them more efficient while saving costs. The Problem Hidden in Plain Sight When an LLM processes a prompt, every token counts toward your cost and the model’s attention limit. For context-heavy applications, it’s common to hit the maximum token window long before you reach the useful part of your data. Adding more context may help the model reason better, but it also slows down inference. Long prompts not only take more time to generate responses but also eat into your budget when using APIs like GPT-4 or Claude. LLMLingua targets this problem directly by compressing prompts intelligently without retraining or modifying the underlying model. What LLMLingua Does Differently LLMLingua uses a smaller, compact language model, like GPT-2 Small or LLaMA-7B. It uses them to identify and remove non-essential tokens in a given prompt. Instead of feeding thousands of tokens into your main model, you send a compact version that retains meaning. This approach achieves up to 20x compression with negligible accuracy loss. In simple terms, LLMLingua lets your LLM read the same content in fewer words. Working with LLMLingua Getting started is simple. The library is available on PyPI and works out of the box. pip install llmlingua Once installed, you can import it into Python to begin compressing prompts. Here’s how you can compress a large text prompt using LLMLingua. from llmlingua import PromptCompressor # Initialize the compressor llm_lingua = PromptCompressor() # Compress the prompt prompt = \"Sam bought a dozen boxes, each with 30 highlighter pens inside, for $10 each box...\" compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, instruction=\"\", question=\"\", target_token=200) print(compressed_prompt) When you run this, you’ll get a dictionary like this: { 'compressed_prompt': 'Question: Sam bought a dozen boxes each with 30 highlighter pens...', 'origin_tokens': 2365, 'compressed_tokens': 211, 'ratio': '11.2x', 'saving': 'Saving $0.1 in GPT-4.' } You can also load different models depending on your resources. # Use a more powerful compression model llm_lingua = PromptCompressor(\"microsoft/phi-2\") # Or use a quantized model for GPUs with limited memory # Requires: pip install optimum auto-gptq llm_lingua = PromptCompressor(\"TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GPTQ\", model_config={\"revision\": \"main\"}) This simple setup can save hundreds of dollars in production if you’re processing long documents or chat histories. Handling Long Contexts with LongLLMLingua LongLLMLingua extends this concept to massive inputs like PDFs, transcripts, or multi-document retrievals. It reorders and filters context dynamically to ensure that the model sees only the most relevant sections. Here’s how you might use it: from llmlingua import PromptCompressor llm_lingua = PromptCompressor() compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt( prompt_list, question=\"What are the main regulatory changes in the last quarter?\", rate=0.55, condition_in_question=\"after_condition\", reorder_context=\"sort\", dynamic_context_compression_ratio=0.3, condition_compare=True, context_budget=\"+100\", rank_method=\"longllmlingua\", ) This works especially well in RAG systems where documents vary in length and relevance. By combining retrieval with compression, you can fit more context into your LLM without hitting token limits. LLMLingua-2: Faster and Smarter Microsoft’s team didn’t stop there. They introduced LLMLingua-2, which is faster and more general-purpose. It uses data distillation from GPT-4 and a BERT-level encoder to improve compression fidelity. This version handles out-of-domain data better and performs 3–6 times faster than the original. from llmlingua import PromptCompressor # Initialize LLMLingua-2 llm_lingua = PromptCompressor( model_name=\"microsoft/llmlingua-2-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank\", use_llmlingua2=True, ) compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.compress_prompt(prompt, rate=0.33, force_tokens=['\\n', '?']) # Or use a smaller multilingual model llm_lingua = PromptCompressor( model_name=\"microsoft/llmlingua-2-bert-base-multilingual-cased-meetingbank\", use_llmlingua2=True, ) For multilingual and enterprise scenarios, LLMLingua-2 offers the right balance between cost, accuracy, and speed. Structured Prompt Compression Sometimes, you want control over which sections of a prompt should be compressed. LLMLingua supports structured compression using special tags. You can mark segments of text to compress at different rates or skip entirely. structured_prompt = \"\"\"Speaker 4: Thank you. And can we do the functions for content? Items I believe are 11, three, 14, 16 and 28, I believe. Speaker 0: Item 11 is a communication from Council on Price recommendation...\"\"\" compressed_prompt = llm_lingua.structured_compress_prompt( structured_prompt, instruction=\"\", question=\"Summarize the meeting notes\", rate=0.5, ) print(compressed_prompt['compressed_prompt']) This feature is especially useful in meeting summarization or note-taking systems where speaker tags or section headers must remain intact. SecurityLingua: Compression as a Defense A newer addition, SecurityLingua, uses security-aware compression to detect malicious jailbreak attempts. It reveals harmful intent hidden within complex prompts and defends against attacks with 100x less token cost compared to traditional guardrails. from llmlingua import PromptCompressor securitylingua = PromptCompressor( model_name=\"SecurityLingua/securitylingua-xlm-s2s\", use_slingua=True ) intention = securitylingua.compress_prompt(malicious_prompt) This model offers a unique approach: instead of filtering after generation, it prevents malicious instructions from reaching the model in the first place. Integration with the Ecosystem One of the reasons LLMLingua stands out is how seamlessly it fits into the modern AI ecosystem. Instead of being a standalone research prototype, it’s already integrated into popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Microsoft Prompt Flow. This means you can plug it directly into your existing RAG or document-processing pipelines without rewriting code or changing your models. For example, in LangChain, LLMLingua acts as a smart middle layer that compresses retrieved context before it reaches the LLM. Imagine you’re using a retriever to pull documents from a knowledge base. Instead of sending those long texts straight to your model, LLMLingua filters out unnecessary tokens so your prompt stays concise and efficient. Here’s how you can integrate it: from langchain_classic.retrievers.contextual_compression import ContextualCompressionRetriever from langchain_community.document_compressors import LLMLinguaCompressor from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI # Initialize your base model llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0) # Create an LLMLingua-based compressor compressor = LLMLinguaCompressor(model_name=\"openai-community/gpt2\", device_map=\"cpu\") # Wrap your existing retriever with LLMLingua compression compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever( base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever # your existing document retriever ) # Use it like a normal retriever, but now with smart compression compressed_docs = compression_retriever.invoke( \"What did the president say about Ketanji Jackson Brown\" ) pretty_print_docs(compressed_docs) In this setup, the retriever first gathers relevant documents, and LLMLingua compresses them before passing them to the LLM. The model receives a condensed but information-rich prompt, which keeps token usage low while maintaining accuracy. This integration works out of the box with any supported model on LangChain. It can be customized to use your preferred compression rate or model variant (like LLMLingua-2). The result is a more efficient pipeline. Your LLM reads less but understands more. Why LLM Lingua Matters LLMLingua may not make headlines like GPT-5 or Gemini, but its impact is fundamental. It addresses the most expensive part of LLM workflows — context handling. By removing redundant tokens and preserving intent, it transforms how developers build scalable AI applications. Whether you’re summarizing regulatory data, processing long legal documents, or powering multilingual chatbots, LLMLingua gives you a new lever for optimization. The takeaway is simple: the future of AI efficiency won’t just come from larger models, but from smarter ones, and smarter prompts. Conclusion Microsoft’s LLMLingua is more than a research project. It’s a quiet revolution in how we deliver information to LLMs. It lets developers stretch context limits, cut costs, and speed up inference — all without retraining a single model. By learning to compress prompts intelligently, LLMLingua helps you talk to machines more efficiently.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_129360543405","title":"The Great Skill Shift","content":"In boardrooms across Silicon Valley, executives are making billion-dollar bets on a future where artificial intelligence doesn't just assist workers—it fundamentally transforms what it means to be productive. The promise is intoxicating: AI agents that can handle complex, multi-step tasks while humans focus on higher-level strategy and creativity. Yet beneath this optimistic veneer lies a more unsettling question. As we delegate increasingly sophisticated work to machines, are we creating a generation of professionals who've forgotten how to think for themselves? The answer may determine whether the workplace of tomorrow breeds innovation or intellectual dependency. The Productivity Revolution Has Already Arrived The transformation has already arrived. Across industries, from software development to financial analysis, AI agents are demonstrating capabilities that would have seemed fantastical just five years ago. These aren't the simple chatbots of yesterday, but sophisticated systems capable of understanding context, managing complex workflows, and executing tasks that once required teams of specialists. The numbers tell a compelling story. Early adopters report gains that dwarf traditional efficiency improvements. Where previous technological advances might have delivered incremental benefits, AI appears to be creating what researchers describe as a \"productivity multiplier effect\"—making individual workers not just marginally better, but fundamentally more capable than their non-AI-assisted counterparts. This isn't merely about automation replacing manual labour. The current wave of AI development focuses on what technologists call \"agentic AI\"—systems designed to handle nuanced, multi-step processes that require decision-making and adaptation. Unlike previous generations of workplace technology that simply digitised existing processes, these agents are redesigning how work gets done from the ground up. Consider the software developer who once spent hours debugging code, now able to identify and fix complex issues in minutes with AI assistance. Or the marketing analyst who previously required days to synthesise market research, now generating comprehensive reports in hours. These aren't hypothetical scenarios—they're the daily reality for thousands of professionals who've integrated AI agents into their workflows. The appeal for businesses is obvious. In a growth-oriented corporate environment where competitive advantage often comes down to speed and efficiency, AI agents represent a chance to dramatically outpace competitors. Companies that master these tools early stand to gain significant market advantages, creating powerful incentives for rapid adoption regardless of potential long-term consequences. Yet this rush towards AI integration raises fundamental questions about the nature of work itself. When machines can perform tasks that once defined professional expertise, what happens to the humans who built their careers on those very skills? The answer isn't simply about job displacement—it's about the more subtle erosion of cognitive capabilities that comes from delegating thinking to machines. The Skills That Matter Now The workplace skills hierarchy is undergoing a seismic shift. Traditional competencies—the ability to perform complex calculations, write detailed reports, or analyse data sets—are becoming less valuable than the ability to effectively direct AI systems to do these tasks. This represents perhaps the most significant change in professional skill requirements since the advent of personal computing. \"Prompt engineering\" has emerged as a critical new competency, though the term itself may be misleading. The skill isn't simply about crafting clever queries for AI systems—it's about understanding how to break down complex problems, communicate nuanced requirements, and iteratively refine AI outputs to meet specific objectives. It's a meta-skill that combines domain expertise with an understanding of how artificial intelligence processes information. This shift creates an uncomfortable reality for many professionals. A seasoned accountant might find that their decades of experience in financial analysis matters less than their ability to effectively communicate with an AI agent that can perform similar analysis in a fraction of the time. The value isn't in knowing how to perform the calculation, but in knowing what calculations to request and how to interpret the results. The transformation extends beyond individual tasks to entire professional identities. In software development, for instance, the role is evolving from writing code to orchestrating AI systems that generate code. The most valuable programmers may not be those who can craft the most elegant solutions, but those who can most effectively translate business requirements into AI-executable instructions. This evolution isn't necessarily negative. Many professionals report that AI assistance has freed them from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on more strategic and creative work. The junior analyst no longer spends hours formatting spreadsheets but can dedicate time to interpreting trends and developing insights. The content creator isn't bogged down in research but can concentrate on crafting compelling narratives. However, this redistribution of human effort assumes that workers can successfully transition from executing tasks to managing AI systems—an assumption that may prove overly optimistic. The skills required for effective AI collaboration aren't simply advanced versions of existing competencies; they represent fundamentally different ways of thinking about work and problem-solving. The question becomes whether this transition enhances human capability or merely creates a sophisticated form of dependency. The Dependency Dilemma As AI agents become more sophisticated, a troubling pattern emerges across various professions. Workers who rely heavily on AI assistance for routine tasks begin to lose fluency in the underlying skills that once defined their expertise. This phenomenon, which some researchers are calling \"skill atrophy,\" represents one of the most significant unintended consequences of AI adoption in the workplace. The concern is particularly acute in technical fields. Software developers who depend on AI to generate code report feeling less confident in their ability to write complex programmes from scratch. Financial analysts who use AI for data processing worry about their diminishing ability to spot errors or anomalies that an AI system might miss. These professionals aren't becoming incompetent, but they are becoming dependent on tools that they don't fully understand or control. Take the case of a senior data scientist at a major consulting firm who recently discovered her team's over-reliance on AI-generated statistical models. When a client questioned the methodology behind a crucial recommendation, none of her junior analysts could explain the underlying mathematical principles. They could operate the AI tools brilliantly, directing them to produce sophisticated analyses, but lacked the foundational knowledge to defend their work when challenged. The firm now requires all analysts to complete monthly exercises using traditional statistical methods, ensuring they maintain the expertise needed to validate AI outputs. The dependency issue extends beyond individual skill loss to broader questions about professional judgement and critical thinking. When AI systems can produce sophisticated analysis or recommendations, there's a natural tendency to accept their outputs without rigorous scrutiny. This creates a feedback loop where human expertise atrophies just as it becomes most crucial for validating AI-generated work. Consider the radiologist who increasingly relies on AI to identify potential abnormalities in medical scans. While the AI system may be highly accurate, the radiologist's ability to independently assess images may decline through disuse. In routine cases, this might not matter. But in complex or unusual situations where AI systems struggle, the human expert may no longer possess the sharp diagnostic skills needed to catch critical errors. This dynamic is particularly concerning because AI systems, despite their sophistication, remain prone to specific types of failures. They can be overconfident in incorrect analyses, miss edge cases that fall outside their training data, or produce plausible-sounding but fundamentally flawed reasoning. Human experts who have maintained their independent skills can catch these errors, but those who have become overly dependent on AI assistance may not. The problem isn't limited to individual professionals. Entire organisations risk developing what could be called \"institutional amnesia\"—losing collective knowledge about how work was done before AI systems took over. When experienced workers retire or leave, they take with them not just their explicit knowledge but their intuitive understanding of when and why AI systems might fail. Some companies begin to recognise this risk and implement policies to ensure that workers maintain their core competencies even as they adopt AI tools. These might include regular \"AI-free\" exercises, mandatory training in foundational skills, or rotation programmes that expose workers to different levels of AI assistance. The challenge lies in balancing efficiency gains with the preservation of human expertise that remains essential for quality control and crisis management. The Innovation Paradox The relationship between AI assistance and human creativity presents a fascinating paradox. While AI agents can dramatically accelerate certain types of work, their impact on innovation and creative thinking remains deeply ambiguous. Some professionals report that AI assistance has unleashed their creativity by handling routine tasks and providing inspiration for new approaches. Others worry that constant AI support makes them intellectually lazy and less capable of original thinking. The optimistic view suggests that AI agents function as creativity multipliers. By handling research, data analysis, and initial drafts, they free human workers to focus on higher-level conceptual work. A marketing professional might use AI to generate multiple campaign concepts quickly, then apply human judgement to select and refine the most promising ideas. An architect might employ AI to explore structural possibilities, then use human expertise to balance aesthetic, functional, and cost considerations. This division of labour between human and artificial intelligence could theoretically produce better outcomes than either could achieve alone. AI systems excel at processing vast amounts of information and generating numerous possibilities, while humans bring contextual understanding, emotional intelligence, and the ability to make nuanced trade-offs. The combination could lead to solutions that are both more comprehensive and more creative than traditional approaches. However, the pessimistic view suggests that this collaboration may be undermining the very cognitive processes that generate genuine innovation. Creative thinking often emerges from struggling with constraints, making unexpected connections, and developing deep familiarity with a problem domain. When AI systems handle these challenges, human workers may miss opportunities for the kind of intensive engagement that produces breakthrough insights. A revealing example comes from a leading architectural firm in London, where partners noticed that junior architects using AI design tools were producing technically competent but increasingly homogeneous proposals. The AI systems, trained on existing architectural databases, naturally gravitated towards proven solutions rather than experimental approaches. When the firm instituted \"analogue design days\"—sessions where architects worked with traditional sketching and model-making tools—the quality and originality of concepts improved dramatically. The physical constraints and slower pace forced designers to think more deeply about spatial relationships and user experience. The concern is that AI assistance might create what could be called \"surface-level expertise\"—professionals who can effectively use AI tools to produce competent work but lack the deep understanding necessary for true innovation. They might be able to generate reports, analyses, or designs that meet immediate requirements but struggle to push beyond conventional approaches or recognise fundamentally new possibilities. This dynamic is particularly visible in fields that require both technical skill and creative insight. Software developers who rely heavily on AI-generated code might produce functional programmes but miss opportunities for elegant or innovative solutions that require deep understanding of programming principles. Writers who depend on AI for research and initial drafts might create readable content but lose the distinctive voice and insight that comes from personal engagement with their subject matter. The innovation paradox extends to organisational learning as well. Companies that become highly efficient at using AI agents for routine work might find themselves less capable of adapting to truly novel challenges. Their workforce might be skilled at optimising existing processes but struggle when fundamental assumptions change or entirely new approaches become necessary. The very efficiency that AI provides in normal circumstances could become a liability when circumstances demand genuine innovation. The Corporate Race and Its Consequences The current wave of AI adoption in the workplace isn't being driven primarily by careful consideration of long-term consequences. Instead, it's fuelled by what industry observers describe as a \"multi-company race\" where businesses feel compelled to implement AI solutions to avoid being left behind by competitors. This competitive dynamic creates powerful incentives for rapid adoption that may override concerns about worker dependency or skill atrophy. The pressure comes from multiple directions simultaneously. Investors reward companies that demonstrate AI integration with higher valuations, creating financial incentives for executives to pursue AI initiatives regardless of their actual business value. Competitors who successfully implement AI solutions can gain significant operational advantages, forcing other companies to follow suit or risk being outcompeted. Meanwhile, the technology industry itself promotes AI adoption through aggressive marketing and the promise of transformative gains. This environment has created what some analysts call a \"useful bubble\"—a period of overinvestment and hype that, despite its excesses, accelerates the development and deployment of genuinely valuable technology. While individual companies might be making suboptimal decisions about AI implementation, the collective effect is rapid advancement in AI capabilities and widespread experimentation with new applications. However, this race dynamic also means that many companies implement AI solutions without adequate consideration of their long-term implications for their workforce. The focus is on immediate competitive advantages rather than sustainable development of human capabilities. Companies that might otherwise take a more measured approach to AI adoption feel compelled to move quickly to avoid falling behind. The consequences of this rushed implementation are already becoming apparent. Many organisations report that their AI initiatives have produced impressive short-term gains but have also created new dependencies and vulnerabilities. Workers who quickly adopted AI tools for routine tasks now struggle when those systems are unavailable or when they encounter problems that require independent problem-solving. Some companies discover that their AI-assisted workforce, while highly efficient in normal circumstances, becomes significantly less effective when facing novel challenges or system failures. The institutional knowledge and problem-solving capabilities that once provided resilience have been inadvertently undermined by the rush to implement AI solutions. The competitive dynamics also create pressure for workers to adopt AI tools regardless of their personal preferences or concerns about skill development. Professionals who might prefer to maintain their independent capabilities often find that they cannot remain competitive without embracing AI assistance. This individual-level pressure mirrors the organisational dynamics, creating a system where rational short-term decisions may lead to problematic long-term outcomes. The irony is that the very speed that makes AI adoption so attractive in competitive markets may also be creating the conditions for future competitive disadvantage. Companies that prioritise immediate efficiency gains over long-term capability development may find themselves vulnerable when market conditions change or when their AI systems encounter situations they weren't designed to handle. Lessons from History's Technological Shifts The current debate about AI agents and worker dependency isn't entirely unprecedented. Throughout history, major technological advances have raised similar concerns about human capability and the relationship between tools and skills. Examining these historical parallels provides valuable perspective on the current transformation while highlighting both the opportunities and risks that lie ahead. The introduction of calculators in the workplace during the 1970s and 1980s sparked intense debate about whether workers would lose essential mathematical skills. Critics worried that reliance on electronic calculation would create a generation of professionals unable to perform basic arithmetic or spot obvious errors in their work. Supporters argued that calculators would free workers from tedious calculations and allow them to focus on more complex analytical tasks. The reality proved more nuanced than either side predicted. While many workers did lose fluency in manual calculation methods, they generally maintained the conceptual understanding necessary to use calculators effectively and catch gross errors. More importantly, the widespread availability of reliable calculation tools enabled entirely new types of analysis and problem-solving that would have been impractical with manual methods. The personal computer revolution of the 1980s and 1990s followed a similar pattern. Early critics worried that word processors would undermine writing skills and that spreadsheet software would eliminate understanding of financial principles. Instead, these tools generally enhanced rather than replaced human capabilities, allowing professionals to produce more sophisticated work while automating routine tasks. However, these historical examples also reveal potential pitfalls. The transition to computerised systems did eliminate certain types of expertise and institutional knowledge. The accountants who understood complex manual bookkeeping systems, the typists who could format documents without software assistance, and the analysts who could perform sophisticated calculations with slide rules represented forms of knowledge that largely disappeared. In most cases, these losses were considered acceptable trade-offs for the enhanced capabilities that new technologies provided. But the transitions weren't always smooth, and some valuable knowledge was permanently lost. More importantly, each technological shift created new dependencies and vulnerabilities that only became apparent during system failures or unusual circumstances. The internet and search engines provide perhaps the most relevant historical parallel to current AI developments. The ability to instantly access vast amounts of information fundamentally changed how professionals research and solve problems. While this democratised access to knowledge and enabled new forms of collaboration, it also raised concerns about attention spans, critical thinking skills, and the ability to work without constant connectivity. Research on internet usage suggests that constant access to information has indeed changed how people think and process information, though the implications remain debated. Some studies indicate reduced ability to concentrate on complex tasks, while others suggest enhanced ability to synthesise information from multiple sources. The reality appears to be that internet technology has created new cognitive patterns rather than simply degrading existing ones. These historical examples suggest that the impact of AI agents on worker capabilities will likely be similarly complex. Some traditional skills will undoubtedly atrophy, while new competencies emerge. The key question isn't whether change will occur, but whether the transition can be managed in ways that preserve essential human capabilities while maximising the benefits of AI assistance. The crucial difference with AI agents is the scope and speed of change. Previous technological shifts typically affected specific tasks or industries over extended periods. AI agents have the potential to transform cognitive work across virtually all professional fields simultaneously, creating unprecedented challenges for workforce adaptation and skill preservation. The Path Forward: Balancing Enhancement and Independence As organisations grapple with the implications of AI adoption, a consensus emerges around the need for more thoughtful approaches to implementation. Rather than simply maximising short-term gains, forward-thinking companies develop strategies that enhance human capabilities while preserving essential skills and maintaining organisational resilience. The most successful approaches appear to involve what researchers call \"graduated AI assistance\"—systems that provide different levels of support depending on the situation and the user's experience level. New employees might receive more comprehensive AI assistance while they develop foundational skills, with support gradually reduced as they gain expertise. Experienced professionals might use AI primarily for routine tasks while maintaining responsibility for complex decision-making and quality control. Some organisations implement \"AI sabbaticals\"—regular periods when workers must complete tasks without AI assistance to maintain their independent capabilities. These might involve monthly exercises where analysts perform calculations manually, writers draft documents without AI support, or programmers solve problems using only traditional tools. While these practices might seem inefficient in the short term, they help ensure that workers retain the skills necessary to function effectively when AI systems are unavailable or inappropriate. Training programmes also evolve to address the new reality of AI-assisted work. Rather than simply teaching workers how to use AI tools, these programmes focus on developing the judgement and critical thinking skills necessary to effectively collaborate with AI systems. This includes understanding when to trust AI outputs, how to validate AI-generated work, and when to rely on human expertise instead of artificial assistance. The concept of working effectively with AI becomes as important as traditional digital literacy was in previous decades. This involves not just technical knowledge about how AI systems work, but understanding their limitations, biases, and failure modes. Workers who develop strong capabilities in this area are better positioned to use these tools effectively while avoiding the pitfalls of over-dependence. Some companies also experiment with hybrid workflows that deliberately combine AI assistance with human oversight at multiple stages. Rather than having AI systems handle entire processes independently, these approaches break complex tasks into components that alternate between artificial and human intelligence. This maintains human engagement throughout the process while still capturing the efficiency benefits of AI assistance. The goal isn't to resist AI adoption or limit its benefits, but to ensure that the integration of AI agents into the workplace enhances rather than replaces human capabilities. This requires recognising that efficiency, while important, isn't the only consideration. Maintaining human agency, preserving essential skills, and ensuring organisational resilience are equally crucial for long-term success. The most sophisticated organisations begin to view AI implementation as a design challenge rather than simply a technology deployment. They consider not just what AI can do, but how its integration affects human development, organisational culture, and long-term adaptability. This perspective leads to more sustainable approaches that balance immediate benefits with future needs. Rethinking Work in the Age of Artificial Intelligence The fundamental question raised by AI agents isn't simply about efficiency—it's about the nature of work itself and what it means to be professionally competent in an age of artificial intelligence. As these systems become more sophisticated and ubiquitous, we're forced to reconsider basic assumptions about skills, expertise, and human value in the workplace. Traditional models of professional development assumed that expertise came from accumulated experience performing specific tasks. The accountant became skilled through years of financial analysis, the programmer through countless hours of coding, the writer through extensive practice with language and research. AI agents challenge this model by potentially eliminating the need for humans to perform many of these foundational tasks. This shift raises profound questions about how future professionals will develop expertise. If AI systems can handle routine analysis, coding, and writing tasks, how will humans develop the deep understanding that comes from hands-on experience? The concern isn't just about skill atrophy among current workers, but about how new entrants to the workforce will develop competency in fields where AI assistance is standard. Some experts argue that this represents an opportunity to reimagine professional education and development. Rather than focusing primarily on task execution, training programmes could emphasise conceptual understanding, creative problem-solving, and the meta-skills necessary for effective AI collaboration. This might produce professionals who are better equipped to handle novel challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. Others worry that this approach might create a generation of workers who understand concepts in theory but lack the practical experience necessary to apply them effectively. The software developer who has always relied on AI for code generation might understand programming principles intellectually but struggle to debug complex problems or optimise performance. The analyst who has never manually processed data might miss subtle patterns or errors that automated systems overlook. The challenge is compounded by the fact that AI systems themselves evolve rapidly. The skills and approaches that are effective for collaborating with today's AI agents might become obsolete as the technology advances. This creates a need for continuous learning and adaptation that goes beyond traditional professional development models. Perhaps most importantly, the rise of AI agents forces a reconsideration of what makes human workers valuable. If machines can perform many cognitive tasks more efficiently than humans, the unique value of human workers increasingly lies in areas where artificial intelligence remains limited: emotional intelligence, creative insight, ethical reasoning, and the ability to navigate complex social and political dynamics. This suggests that the most successful professionals in an AI-dominated workplace might be those who develop distinctly human capabilities while learning to effectively collaborate with artificial intelligence. Rather than competing with AI systems or becoming dependent on them, these workers would leverage AI assistance while maintaining their unique human strengths. The transformation also raises questions about the social and psychological aspects of work. Many people derive meaning and identity from their professional capabilities and achievements. If AI systems can perform the tasks that once provided this sense of accomplishment, how will workers find purpose and satisfaction in their careers? The answer may lie in redefining professional success around uniquely human contributions rather than task completion. The Generational Divide One of the most significant aspects of the AI transformation is the generational divide it creates in the workplace. Workers who developed their skills before AI assistance became available often have different perspectives and capabilities compared to those who are entering the workforce in the age of artificial intelligence. This divide has implications not just for individual careers but for organisational culture and knowledge transfer. Experienced professionals who learned their trades without AI assistance often possess what could be called \"foundational fluency\"—deep, intuitive understanding of their field that comes from years of hands-on practice. These workers can often spot errors, identify unusual patterns, or develop creative solutions based on their accumulated experience. When they use AI tools, they typically do so as supplements to their existing expertise rather than replacements for it. In contrast, newer workers who have learned their skills alongside AI assistance might develop different cognitive patterns. They might be highly effective at directing AI systems and interpreting their outputs, but less confident in their ability to work independently. This isn't necessarily a deficit—these workers might be better adapted to the future workplace—but it represents a fundamentally different type of professional competency. The generational divide creates challenges for knowledge transfer within organisations. Experienced workers might struggle to teach skills that they developed through extensive practice to younger colleagues who primarily work with AI assistance. Similarly, younger workers might find it difficult to learn from mentors whose expertise is based on pre-AI methods and assumptions. Some organisations address this challenge by creating \"reverse mentoring\" programmes where younger workers teach AI skills to experienced colleagues while learning foundational competencies in return. These programmes recognise that both types of expertise are valuable and that the most effective professionals might be those who combine traditional skills with AI fluency. The generational divide also raises questions about career progression and leadership development. As AI systems handle more routine tasks, advancement might increasingly depend on the meta-skills necessary for effective AI collaboration rather than traditional measures of technical competency. This could advantage workers who are naturally adept at working with AI systems while potentially disadvantaging those whose expertise is primarily based on independent task execution. However, the divide isn't simply about age or experience level. Some younger workers deliberately develop traditional skills alongside AI competencies, recognising the value of foundational expertise. Similarly, some experienced professionals become highly skilled at AI collaboration while maintaining their independent capabilities. The most successful professionals might be those who can bridge both worlds effectively. The challenge for organisations is creating environments where both types of expertise can coexist and complement each other. This might involve restructuring teams to include both AI-native workers and those with traditional skills, or developing career paths that value different types of competency equally. Looking Ahead: Scenarios for the Future As AI agents continue to evolve and proliferate in the workplace, several distinct scenarios emerge for how this transformation might unfold. Each presents different implications for worker capabilities, skill development, and the fundamental nature of professional work. Understanding these possibilities can help organisations and individuals make more informed decisions about AI adoption and workforce development. The optimistic scenario envisions AI agents as powerful tools that enhance human capabilities without undermining essential skills. In this future, AI systems handle routine tasks while humans focus on creative, strategic, and interpersonal work. Workers develop strong capabilities in working with AI alongside traditional competencies, creating a workforce that is both more efficient and more capable than previous generations. Organisations implement thoughtful policies that preserve human expertise while maximising the benefits of AI assistance. This scenario assumes that the current concerns about skill atrophy and dependency are temporary growing pains that will be resolved as both technology and human practices mature. Workers and organisations learn to use AI tools effectively while maintaining the human capabilities necessary for independent function. The result is a workplace that combines the efficiency of artificial intelligence with the creativity and judgement of human expertise. The pessimistic scenario warns of widespread skill atrophy and intellectual dependency. In this future, over-reliance on AI agents creates a generation of workers who can direct artificial intelligence but cannot function effectively without it. When AI systems fail or encounter novel situations, human workers lack the foundational skills necessary to maintain efficiency or solve problems independently. Organisations become vulnerable to system failures and lose the institutional knowledge necessary for adaptation and innovation. This scenario suggests that the current rush to implement AI solutions creates long-term vulnerabilities that aren't immediately apparent. The short-term gains from AI adoption mask underlying weaknesses that will become critical problems when circumstances change or new challenges emerge. A third scenario involves fundamental transformation of work itself. Rather than simply augmenting existing jobs, AI agents might eliminate entire categories of work while creating completely new types of professional roles. In this future, the current debate about skill preservation becomes irrelevant because the nature of work changes so dramatically that traditional competencies are no longer applicable. This transformation scenario suggests that worrying about maintaining current skills might be misguided—like a blacksmith in 1900 worrying about the impact of automobiles on horseshoeing. The focus should instead be on developing the entirely new capabilities that will be necessary in a fundamentally different workplace. The reality will likely involve elements of all three scenarios, with different industries and organisations experiencing different outcomes based on their specific circumstances and choices. The key insight is that the future isn't predetermined—the decisions made today about AI implementation, workforce development, and skill preservation will significantly influence which scenario becomes dominant. The most probable outcome may be a hybrid future where some aspects of work become highly automated while others remain distinctly human. The challenge will be managing the transition in ways that preserve valuable human capabilities while embracing the benefits of AI assistance. This will require unprecedented coordination between technology developers, employers, educational institutions, and policymakers. The Choice Before Us The integration of AI agents into the workplace represents one of the most significant transformations in the nature of work since the Industrial Revolution. Unlike previous technological changes that primarily affected manual labour or routine cognitive tasks, AI agents challenge the foundations of professional expertise across virtually every field. The choices made in the next few years about how to implement and regulate these systems will shape the workplace for generations to come. The evidence suggests that AI agents can indeed make workers dramatically more efficient, potentially creating the kind of gains that drive economic growth and improve living standards. However, the same evidence also indicates that poorly managed AI adoption can create dangerous dependencies and undermine the human capabilities that remain essential for dealing with novel challenges and system failures. The path forward requires rejecting false dichotomies between human and artificial intelligence in favour of more nuanced approaches that maximise the benefits of AI assistance while preserving essential human capabilities. This means developing new models of professional education that combine working effectively with AI alongside foundational skills, implementing organisational policies that prevent over-dependence on automated systems, and creating workplace cultures that value both efficiency and resilience. Perhaps most importantly, it requires recognising that the question isn't whether AI agents will change the nature of work—they already have. The question is whether these changes will enhance human potential or diminish it. The answer depends not on the technology itself, but on the wisdom and intentionality with which we choose to integrate it into our working lives. The workers and organisations that thrive in this new environment will likely be those that learn to dance with artificial intelligence rather than being led by it—using AI tools to amplify their capabilities while maintaining the independence and expertise necessary to chart their own course. The future belongs not to those who can work without AI or those who become entirely dependent on it, but to those who can effectively collaborate with artificial intelligence while preserving what makes them distinctly and valuably human. In the end, the question of whether AI agents will make us more efficient or more dependent misses the deeper point. The real question is whether we can be intentional enough about this transformation to create a future where artificial intelligence serves human flourishing rather than replacing it. The answer lies not in the systems themselves, but in the choices we make about how to integrate them into the most fundamentally human activity of all: work. The stakes couldn't be higher, and the window for thoughtful action grows narrower each day. We stand at a crossroads where the decisions we make about AI integration will echo through decades of human work and creativity. Choose wisely—our cognitive independence depends on it.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_ee671a74f92b","title":"Satya Nadella logr√≥ que el mundo volviese a amar Microsoft. La IA est√° provocando que la gente la odie de nuevo","content":"Microsoft quiere convertir Windows en un \"sistema operativo ag√©ntico\". Ese fue uno de los grandes anuncios de las conferencias Ingnite que se celebraron estos d√≠as. La propuesta pasa por llenar Windows de agentes de IA para que formen parte de la experiencia de usuario y hagan cosas por nosotros. La intenci√≥n es buena. El resultado no. Qu√© est√° pasando. Windows cumple en 2025 su 40 aniversario (y Microsoft, su 50), y lo hace con una apuesta total por la IA que ahora quiere trasladar a su sistema operativo Windows. En el evento Microsoft Ignite se presentaron diversas novedades que precisamente estaban dirigidas a integrar agentes de IA en el sistema desde la barra de tareas, pero tambi√©n a dar soporte a Model Context Protocol, el estandar de facto para conectar agentes de IA con servicios y aplicaciones de terceros. En Xataka Microsoft ya no es (ni ser√°) la empresa de Windows, es la empresa de la inteligencia artificial y la nube El movimiento es razonable. La decisi√≥n de Microsoft es estrat√©gicamente impecable. La IA est√° por todos lados, y lo que pretende la compa√±√≠a es que sea parte integral de su sistema operativo. Y de paso, claro, que no salgas de su ecosistema para aprovecharla. La intenci√≥n es buena, pero el problema de Microsoft es otro. Est√°s siendo cansina. A menudo ocurre que las empresas que intentan promocionar sus servicios lo hacen de una forma especialmente cansina. Microsoft es desde luego conocida por ello, y solo hay que recordar c√≥mo realiz√≥ numerosos intentos para forzarnos a actualizar a Windows 10. Luego llegaron intentos similares con las nuevas versiones de Windows 11. Con la IA se ha disparado ya alguna que otra vez en el pie, y el mejor ejemplo es Microsoft Recall, una opci√≥n llamativa que por su dise√±o inicial acab√≥ retras√°ndose y ahora ha quedado totalmente relegada a un segundo plano. Pues instalo Linux.Pavan Davuluri, presidente de la divisi√≥n de Windows y dispositivos, hablaba de esa integraci√≥n de la IA en Windows hace unos d√≠as, pero su tuit acab√≥ provocando una retah√≠la de cr√≠ticas. Una de las primeras respuestas indicaba que Windows \"est√° evolucionando a un producto que lleva a la gente al Mac y a Linux\". O ya puestos, traed de vuelta Windows 7. Otros iban m√°s all√° y ped√≠an que volviese el sistema operativo Windows 7 con su \"interfaz de usuario limpia, iconos, panel de control unificado, sin apps basura, sin anuncios, simplemente un sistema operativo puro y que rend√≠a\". A Microsoft le crecen los enanos. Davuluri acab√≥ cerrando los comentarios dos d√≠as despu√©s, pero s√≠ respondi√≥ a un tuit del conocido ingeniero software Gergely Orosz, que critic√≥ la err√°tica estrategia de Windows y tambi√©n el compromiso de Microsoft con los desarrolladores. En su respuesta indic√≥ que \"sabemos que debemos seguir trabajando en la experiencia de usuario, tanto en la usabilidad del d√≠a a d√≠a y los di√°logos de sistema inconsistente a las experiencias de usuarios avanzados\". Cuidado con promocionar lo que no funciona. El problema de Copilot es que sigue teniendo una reputaci√≥n claramente peor que la de otros modelos de IA a pesar de estar totalmente basado en ChatGPT. En Microsoft lo saben, pero aun as√≠ est√°n contratando a influencers para promocionar Copilot entre los consumidores m√°s j√≥venes. Nadella empez√≥ bien... La llegada de Satya Nadella a Microsoft fue un soplo de aire fresco. La empresa iba camino de convertirse en la nueva IBM, pero su sorprendente renovaci√≥n y esp√≠ritu de apertura ‚Äîcompra de GitHub, renovado amor por Linux‚Äî se uni√≥ al √©xito que le dio reforzar Azure y convertir su plataforma en la nube en una m√°quina de hacer dinero. Lanzaba proyectos estupendos y recobraba as√≠ parte del amor (y lustre) que hab√≠a perdido en los √∫ltimos a√±os con Ballmer al frente. ... pero las cosas se est√°n torciendo. Sin embargo esta (entendible) obsesi√≥n con la IA est√° contaminando un poco toda esa trayectoria, y eso se nota en los comentarios y cr√≠ticas de los usuarios, que no parecen interesados en que Windows est√© lleno de IA aun cuando eso pueda a la larga ser interesante. Las ventajas pr√°cticas de momento no parecen ser destacables, y forzarlas nunca es buena idea. Y por si Nadella nos lee, planteamos una idea. Dejar que los usuarios decidan. Es tan simple como eso: Microsoft fuerza demasiado las cosas obligando a los usuarios a aceptar esos cambios en el sistema sin m√°s y ofreci√©ndolos como opciones que est√°n ah√≠ activadas por defecto. A los usuarios no suele gustarles que les cambien las cosas por las buenas, y lo que deber√≠a hacer Microsoft es hacerlo todo opt-in (y no opt-out). Es decir: ofrecer esas opciones deshabilitadas por defecto, y dejar que sean los usuarios los que decidan activarlas.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_d84fe52ed419","title":"Hemos llegado a un punto donde ni siquiera los CEO de Google o Microsoft niegan que tengamos una burbuja IA","content":"Lo que pasa con las burbujas es que tenemos la certeza de que hay una solamente cuando estallan. Y con todo esto de la inteligencia artificial, se est√° hablando mucho sobre si existe una o no en torno a esta tecnolog√≠a. Desde luego hay indicadores que hacen saltar las alarmas, pero lo curioso es que no hubi√©semos cre√≠do que dos de los m√°ximos exponentes en contribuir hacia el desarrollo de esta tecnolog√≠a mantuvieran reservas. Y es que Sundar Pichai, por la parte de Google, y Satya Nadella, de Microsoft, no se han esforzado mucho en negar las dudas. Irracionalidad. Pichai declar√≥ a la BBC en una entrevista que observa \"elementos de irracionalidad\" en el mercado actual de la IA y advirti√≥ que ninguna compa√±√≠a, incluida Google, ser√° inmune si la burbuja estalla. Sus palabras resultan especialmente llamativas porque llegan en un momento en que las acciones de Alphabet se han duplicado en siete meses, alcanzando una capitalizaci√≥n burs√°til de 3,5 billones de d√≥lares. El CEO compar√≥ la situaci√≥n con la burbuja de Internet de finales de los a√±os 90, reconociendo que aunque hubo una inversi√≥n excesiva que acab√≥ en quiebras y despidos, nadie cuestiona hoy el impacto profundo de Internet. \"Espero que la IA sea igual. Creo que es tanto racional como que hay elementos de irracionalidad en un momento como este\", explic√≥. En Xataka Lo √∫nico que ha logrado la Ley de la IA de Europa es dejarnos cojos. La pregunta es si dar marcha atr√°s servir√° de algo Cuando los n√∫meros no cuadran. El escepticismo tiene fundamento en datos concretos. OpenAI, el competidor m√°s visible de Google en este terreno, se ha comprometido a gastar 1,4 billones de d√≥lares en infraestructura durante ocho a√±os mientras espera generar apenas 13.000 millones en ingresos este a√±o. Tal y como comparte el medio Ars Technica, el propio Sam Altman, CEO de OpenAI, reconoci√≥ en agosto ante periodistas que los inversores est√°n \"demasiado entusiasmados\" con los modelos de IA y que \"alguien\" perder√° una \"cantidad incre√≠ble de dinero\". Microsoft tambi√©n muestra las cartas. Por su parte, Satya Nadella ha sido igualmente directo sobre las limitaciones actuales del sector. A comienzos de a√±o ya se√±alaba que reivindicar que se ha logrado un hito en AGI (inteligencia artificial general) es \"solo hackear las pruebas sin sentido\", restando importancia a los benchmarks que tanto marketing generan. Seg√∫n Nadella, la verdadera m√©trica del √©xito de la IA deber√≠a reflejarse en el producto interior bruto de los pa√≠ses: \"Cuando decimos 'esto es como la revoluci√≥n industrial', deber√≠amos tener ese tipo de crecimiento que provoc√≥ la revoluci√≥n industrial\", explic√≥, refiri√©ndose a incrementos del 5-10% en el PIB. Ese crecimiento a√∫n no ha llegado. Jensen Huang dice exactamente lo contrario. Mientras Pichai y Nadella hablan de irracionalidad, el fundador y CEO de NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, ha presentado resultados espectaculares en el tercer trimestre y zanj√≥ el debate a su manera. \"Se ha hablado mucho de una burbuja de la IA. Desde nuestra perspectiva, vemos algo muy diferente\", comentaba. NVIDIA report√≥ ingresos de 57.000 millones de d√≥lares en su √∫ltimo trimestre, un 62% m√°s que el a√±o anterior, con beneficios netos de 32.000 millones. Su negocio de centros de datos ha generado 51.200 millones de d√≥lares, un r√©cord impulsado por la venta de sus chips Blackwell. Seg√∫n Huang, las ventas de estas GPU est√°n \"por las nubes\" y los chips en la nube est√°n agotados. NVIDIA proyecta adem√°s un cuarto trimestre con ingresos de 65.000 millones de d√≥lares. En Xataka El problema no es que la IA no sea capaz de leer la hora. El problema es confirmar que no razona y solo repite lo que ha visto La IA a√∫n no da dinero. NVIDIA s√≠ gana dinero, mucho dinero, pero lo hace vendiendo las palas durante la fiebre del oro. La inmensa mayor√≠a de empresas que desarrollan grandes modelos de lenguaje est√°n perdiendo dinero de forma espectacular. OpenAI es el ejemplo m√°s evidente, pero no el √∫nico. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta y Google est√°n destinando decenas de miles de millones de d√≥lares a construir centros de datos dedicados a la IA en una apuesta colosal cuya rentabilidad no est√° garantizada. Para Nadella, lo que la IA necesita es algo equivalente a lo que supusieron Excel y el correo electr√≥nico para el PC, es decir, una app que haga entender a la mayor√≠a de los usuarios c√≥mo usar la IA. En aquella √©poca vimos que el PC tard√≥ bastante hasta encontrar su sitio, sobre todo hasta alcanzar una adopci√≥n masiva que transformase procesos reales. En Xataka La financiaci√≥n circular de la IA no hab√≠a terminado: NVIDIA, Microsoft y Anthropic han firmado un nuevo acuerdo milmillonario Hay chips pero falta energ√≠a para alimentarlos. Adem√°s del problema de rentabilidad, existe una limitaci√≥n f√≠sica inmediata. Nadella revel√≥ recientemente que el mayor obst√°culo no es la falta de chips, sino la energ√≠a necesaria para alimentarlos. \"Si no puedes hacer algo as√≠ [suministrar suficiente energ√≠a], tendr√°s un mont√≥n de chips abandonados en el inventario y que no puedes conectar. De hecho, ese es mi problema ahora mismo: no es que no tenga un suministro suficiente de chips: en realidad es el hecho de que no tengo lugares en los que conectarlos\", admiti√≥. Microsoft, Google y otras grandes tecnol√≥gicas est√°n recurriendo a soluciones dr√°sticas como construir sus propias centrales nucleares peque√±as (reactores SMR) para abastecer sus futuros centros de datos. El CEO de ARM, Rene Haas, apunt√≥ que las necesidades energ√©ticas podr√≠an triplicarse, un desaf√≠o que pone en cuesti√≥n la sostenibilidad de la expansi√≥n actual. Desde luego no sabemos c√≥mo va a terminar la cosa, pero nadie duda de que vamos a estar un buen rato entretenidos con ello.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_5308d764ed41","title":"La luz verde de los sem√°foros significa en todo el mundo que puedes circular. En todo el mundo excepto en Jap√≥n","content":"Rojo, √°mbar y verde. Los tres colores de los sem√°foros en todo el mundo. ¬øEn todo el mundo? No, unos particulares sem√°foros japoneses resisten hoy y por siempre... a la Convenci√≥n de Viena sobre Se√±ales y Se√±ales de Tr√°fico al que est√°n adheridos m√°s de 50 Estados. Aunque en √©l hay ausencias curiosas como las de Estados Unidos o, por supuesto, Jap√≥n. Este marco normativo se firm√≥ por primera vez en 1968, impulsado por el Consejo Econ√≥mico y Social de las Naciones Unidas. El texto ven√≠a a revisar normas anteriores con el objetivo de homogeneizar el tr√°fico en todos los pa√≠ses que fuera posible. La √∫ltima revisi√≥n, de hecho, es de 2003 y en √©l se atendi√≥ la modernizaci√≥n de algunas se√±ales o las normas de prioridad en las rotondas. La intenci√≥n es que lo que entendemos en Espa√±a por un Stop tambi√©n lo sea en Francia o Alemania. Y as√≠ es, de hecho, porque toda Europa est√° suscrita a dicho texto. Pero las ausencias m√°s llamativas, como la de Jap√≥n, da lugar a an√©cdotas curiosas. Como la de encontrarnos sem√°foros donde la prioridad de paso no se otorga con el verde, se aplica cuando la luz se pone azul. En Xataka Jap√≥n tiene uno de los parques automovil√≠sticos m√°s j√≥venes del mundo. Su secreto: una ITV absurdamente cara Azul, que te quiero azulY es que si viajas a Jap√≥n y tienes pensado conducir, hay un detalle que no debes pasar por alto (m√°s all√° de que se conduce por la izquierda, recuerda): la luz verde de algunos sem√°foros es azul. O turquesa, m√°s exactamente. El origen hay que encontrarlo en el propio idioma. El japon√©s no ten√≠a una palabra espec√≠fica para referirse al verde. Para mencionarlo hac√≠an referencia a la palabra \"Ao\". El problema es que \"Ao\" hace referencia a un amplio espectro de colores y entre ellos, como ya te puedes imaginar, al azul o azul verdoso o turquesa. Algunas fuentes apuntan a que la palabra \"Midori\", que ata√±e espec√≠ficamente al color verde, se populariz√≥ durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial por una pura cuesti√≥n pr√°ctica a la hora de diferenciar ambos colores. Sin embargo, buena parte de la sociedad se sigui√≥ refiriendo al verde como \"Ao\" y, de hecho, sigue formando parte de palabras que se aplican exclusivamente para definir objetos verdes, como aoshing≈ç... que de hecho es la palabra oficial para la luz verde del sem√°foro pese a que no significa espec√≠ficamente verde. En Xataka La levitaci√≥n magn√©tica para coches tiene un primer prototipo en Jap√≥n. Es una tecnolog√≠a tan prometedora como experimental En 1960, Jap√≥n firm√≥ su propia Ley de Tr√°fico donde quedaba recogido dicho t√©rmino para hablar del sem√°foro. Dicha ley es, por tanto, anterior a la mencionada Convenci√≥n de Viena y se mantuvo intacta hasta 1973 cuando una orden ministerial termin√≥ por especificar que la luz del sem√°foro deb√≠a ser todo lo azulada posible dentro del verde, como medida de compromiso entre mantener los sem√°foros que ya estaban instalados y acercarse a las convenciones internacionales. El resultado es que los sem√°foros m√°s antiguos tienen un azul m√°s intenso y los m√°s modernos cuentan con un tono verde con ligeros matices azules que pueden recordar al turquesa. Con todo, no son exactamente verdes porque el t√©rmino \"Ao\" sirve, como dec√≠amos, tanto para el azul como para el verde.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_b2f5523b21fc","title":"Hay un canario en la mina que recuerda a la crisis subprime: gente en EEUU pagando a plazos la compra del supermercado","content":"Estados Unidos enfrenta un fen√≥meno financiero inquietante que empieza a extenderse por Europa: 91,5 millones de personas financian sus compras con servicios de pago aplazado sin intereses, y el 25% de ellos los usa para algo tan b√°sico como llenar el frigor√≠fico. La morosidad no deja de crecer: del 34% en 2023 al 42% este a√±o. La alarma no viene de analistas pesimistas, sino de Nigel Morris, cofundador de Capital One e inversor en Klarna. Alguien que construy√≥ un imperio entendiendo exactamente cu√°nto estr√©s financiero puede soportar el estadounidense medio antes de quebrar. Por qu√© es importante. Adem√°s de por el dato en s√≠, porque la mayor√≠a de estos pr√©stamos no aparecen en los historiales crediticios tradicionales. Los reguladores lo llaman \"deuda fantasma\". Un banco puede considerar solvente a alguien que est√° ahog√°ndose con cinco micropr√©stamos simult√°neos entre Klarna, Affirm y PayPal. El sistema vuela a ciegas. Morris lo resume: \"Si soy un proveedor de BNPL y no consulto datos de las agencias de cr√©dito, ignoro por completo que alguien puede haber sacado diez de estos pr√©stamos la semana pasada\". Y eso es exactamente lo que est√° pasando. Entre l√≠neas. El BNPL replica peligrosamente la l√≥gica previa a 2008: deuda concentrada en prestatarios vulnerables, empaquetada y vendida a inversores que creen entender el riesgo. Elliott Advisors compr√≥ la cartera brit√°nica de Klarna por 39.000 millones de d√≥lares.KKR acord√≥ adquirir hasta 44.000 millones en deuda BNPL de PayPal.La diferencia con la crisis subprime es que gran parte de esa deuda permanece invisible para el sistema financiero. En Xataka El negocio secreto detr√°s de tus compras sin intereses: as√≠ es como El Corte Ingl√©s convierte tus cuotas en oro financiero El contraste. La Administraci√≥n Biden intent√≥ regular el BNPL como tarjetas de cr√©dito. Trump dio marcha atr√°s en mayo tras las presiones del sector, revocando 67 reglas. D√≠as despu√©s, la Oficina de Protecci√≥n Financiera public√≥ un informe sorprendentemente optimista: los clientes devolv√≠an sus pr√©stamos el 98% de las veces. La discrepancia con el 42% de morosidad real desvela el problema: nadie sabe realmente qu√© ocurre cuando alguien maneja varias cuentas simult√°neas. S√≠, pero. Al no reportar a las agencias de cr√©dito, estas empresas impiden que sus clientes construyan historial para acceder a cr√©dito m√°s barato. \"Algunas empresas no quieren que eso ocurra porque no quieren que el consumidor se grad√∫e\", reconoce Morris. Es parte del modelo de negocio: mantener a los usuarios atrapados. Y Europa no es inmune. Klarna opera como banco licenciado desde 2017 y ha expandido su modelo a grandes superficies comerciales espa√±olas. La integraci√≥n con Apple Pay y Google Pay lo convierte en algo tan simple como acercar el m√≥vil al dat√°fono. Lo que empez√≥ como opci√≥n de pago nicho se est√° convirtiendo en infraestructura financiera integrada. Punto de inflexi√≥n. Morris no predice un desplome, pero urge vigilancia. En Estados Unidos se acumulan se√±ales: desempleo al alza, fin de moratorias de pr√©stamos estudiantiles, desregulaci√≥n acelerada... La combinaci√≥n crea condiciones donde los problemas podr√≠an dispararse r√°pidamente. Y cuando la deuda del consumidor se vuelve insostenible, el dolor se extiende. Tambi√©n hasta los inversores que financiaron este ecosistema.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_b093f278cc45","title":"El proyecto biom√©trico de Sam Altman aspiraba a escanear mil millones de ojos. No ha llegado ni al 2%","content":"World, el ambicioso proyecto de Sam Altman para verificar la identidad humana mediante escaneos de iris, ha conseguido registrar a 17,5 millones de personas desde su lanzamiento p√∫blico en 2023. Una cifra que, si bien puede parecer impresionante, apenas representa el 2% de su objetivo inicial de mil millones de usuarios. Una promesa. La idea de Altman era crear una red global de identidad digital verificada mediante biometr√≠a ocular. Para ello, los usuarios tienen que presentarse ante un dispositivo esf√©rico llamado Orb que escanea sus iris y genera un c√≥digo digital √∫nico, el World ID. A cambio, pueden acceder a una aplicaci√≥n con diversos servicios mientras tambi√©n reciben tokens de la criptomoneda Worldcoin, que actualmente vale unos 60 c√©ntimos de euro por unidad. \"Est√° creando la enfermedad, pero tambi√©n quiere crear la cura\", afirmaba un exempleado de la compa√±√≠a al medio Business Insider. En Xataka Hay personas poniendo los cuernos a sus parejas. Todo normal excepto porque lo est√°n haciendo con una IA Regulaci√≥n. El proyecto ha topado con una muralla de rechazo institucional. Tal y como comparte el medio, Espa√±a, Hong Kong, Portugal, Indonesia, Alemania y Brasil han impuesto vetos, suspensiones u √≥rdenes cautelares, mientras que en Kenia se prohibi√≥ un mes despu√©s del lanzamiento. Las autoridades alemanas concluyeron el a√±o pasado que las medidas de protecci√≥n de datos \"no ser√≠an suficientes para implementar un nivel de seguridad apropiado frente a ciberdelincuentes o atacantes estatales\". En octubre, Filipinas emiti√≥ una orden de cese, Colombia orden√≥ detener operaciones y borrar datos, y Tailandia realiz√≥ redadas arrestando a sospechosos por operar un negocio de activos digitales sin licencia, seg√∫n Business Insider. Por otro lado, el Ministerio de Seguridad del Estado chino advirti√≥ que recopilar datos de iris para criptomonedas podr√≠a representar una amenaza para la seguridad nacional. Un modelo cuestionado. M√°s all√° de las trabas legales, algunos expertos consultados por el medio han cuestionado la viabilidad del proyecto. Nick Maynard, vicepresidente de investigaci√≥n fintech en Juniper Research aseguraba que \"no veo un caso de uso definitivo que hayan resuelto y que vaya a generar tracci√≥n importante. Necesitan un prop√≥sito real para existir, y eso no est√° del todo claro todav√≠a\". La estructura corporativa tambi√©n es compleja, pues Tools for Humanity (con sede en San Francisco y M√∫nich) desarrolla la tecnolog√≠a; la World Foundation, desde las Islas Caim√°n, controla el proyecto; y World Assets Limited, en las Islas V√≠rgenes Brit√°nicas, gestiona la distribuci√≥n de tokens. Por el momento, la compa√±√≠a ha recaudado 240 millones de d√≥lares de inversores como Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital y Khosla Ventures, con una valoraci√≥n de 2.500 millones de d√≥lares. La estrategia de expansi√≥n. Seg√∫n exempleados que han contactado con Business Insider, la compa√±√≠a opt√≥ por una estrategia agresiva de crecimiento en mercados emergentes, priorizando pa√≠ses donde la promesa de criptomonedas gratuitas generaba tracci√≥n entre poblaciones vulnerables econ√≥micamente. En M√©xico, los operadores locales deb√≠an cubrir la mayor√≠a de costes de los locales de escaneo, aunque Tools for Humanity pagaba el alquiler durante un a√±o. En Argentina, organizadores externos llegaron a enviar autobuses con personas que viajaban para escanearse a cambio de dinero. Imagen: World Luis Ruben De Valad√©z, que trabaj√≥ como jefe de operaciones en M√©xico, comentaba al medio que tuvo que reunir unos 100.000 pesos mexicanos (unos 4.705,75 euros al cambio) de familiares y amigos para abrir siete tiendas en Ciudad de M√©xico. Tal y como compart√≠a, los operadores independientes cobraban por comisi√≥n en Worldcoin, y era habitual que surgieran casas de cambio cerca de las estaciones de Orbs donde los usuarios cambiaban inmediatamente sus tokens para obtener el efectivo. En Xataka En 2018 Rusia present√≥ a su nuevo y revolucionario robot humanoide. El √∫nico problema es que no era un robot El dilema de la monetizaci√≥n. La compa√±√≠a no cobra a los usuarios por acceder a sus plataformas, y su CEO Alex Blania ha prometido que no se convertir√°n en intermediarios de datos. Seg√∫n se conoce, la compa√±√≠a obtiene ingresos por tarifas de verificaci√≥n (World ID fees) cuando aplicaciones externas usan sus servicios. Tambi√©n obtienen ingresos a trav√©s de un programa que permite alquilar o comprar Orbs propios, y por comisiones de procesamiento en su blockchain World Chain. Sin embargo, un exempleado revelaba al medio que la compa√±√≠a expres√≥ dudas sobre si estas tarifas generar√≠an beneficios por s√≠ solas, indicando que el futuro financiero depender√≠a sobre todo de que siga fluyendo capital por parte de los inversores. \"Tengo problemas para verlo como un negocio. No hay un incentivo para comprar o arrendar un Orb m√°s all√° de ganar dinero escaneando montones de ojos, y para los usuarios es obtener m√°s monedas\", comentaba Martha Bennett, vicepresidenta y analista principal en Forrester, a Business Insider. Apuesta por las alianzas. Para acelerar el crecimiento, World anunci√≥ asociaciones con empresas ya establecidas. Hay un programa piloto con Match Group para verificar usuarios de Tinder en Jap√≥n, y acuerdos con Stripe, Visa y la compa√±√≠a de gaming Razer. Seg√∫n inform√≥ Semafor, Reddit tambi√©n estuvo en conversaciones para usar sus servicios de verificaci√≥n. En Xataka Hasta ahora en ChatGPT chate√°bamos solo con una IA. Ahora comienza a parecerse m√°s a WhatsApp Nikhil Bhatia, profesor de finanzas en la Universidad del Sur de California y especializado en criptomonedas, comentaba a Business Insider que \"es dif√≠cil juzgar algo que es una cripto con una capitalizaci√≥n de mercado de 2.000 millones como algo m√°s que experimental o una moda pasajera. Worldcoin no es un contendiente de ninguna manera como moneda o activo frente al d√≥lar o Bitcoin\". Y ahora qu√©. La compa√±√≠a ha anunciado su intenci√≥n de alcanzar 100 millones de registros durante el pr√≥ximo a√±o, seg√∫n fuentes citadas por el New York Post. Pero el camino est√° plagado de interrogantes. Si contin√∫a requiriendo que las personas se presenten f√≠sicamente en sus oficinas para escanear sus ojos, la escalabilidad podr√≠a resultar compleja. Y si persisten los problemas regulatorios en los mercados m√°s poblados del mundo, m√°s dif√≠cil lo tendr√° la compa√±√≠a a√∫n. World se enfrenta a algo com√∫n en muchos proyectos tecnol√≥gicos: con una visi√≥n futurista potente y capital de sobra, no parece tener un producto que resuelva un problema inmediato para la mayor√≠a de usuarios ni un modelo de negocio claramente rentable. De momento falta convencer a mucha gente. En Xataka | La pregunta no es si la IA lograr√° crear obras de arte. La pregunta es si las consideraremos como tales - La noticia El proyecto biom√©trico de Sam Altman aspiraba a escanear mil millones de ojos.

Hij vertelde het publiek dat Bosch weigerde om promotionele activiteiten voor gastland Thailand uit te voeren. Toen zij weerwoord gaf, raakte hij geïrriteerd: \"Ik heb je niet gevraagd te praten, blijf alsjeblieft beleefd. Ik ben nog aan het praten. Luister! Waarom sta je op om tegen mij te praten?\" Bosch bleef protesteren tegen zijn denigrerende toon en na een woordenwisseling verliet zij de zaal, gevolgd door meerdere andere deelnemers die hun solidariteit met haar wilden betuigen. Beelden van de confrontatie: Het incident kwam Nawat op bestraffende woorden te staan van zijn medeorganisator, de Mexicaanse zakenman Raul Rocha. Zelf bood hij zijn excuses aan, maar daarmee was de commotie rond het evenement nog niet geluwd. Deze week trok de Libanees-Franse componist Omar Harfouch zich terug uit de jury, uit onvrede over de manier waarop de organisatie kandidaten had geselecteerd voor de laatste ronde van de missverkiezing. Ook de Franse oud-voetballer Claude Makélélé stapte op als jurylid, naar eigen zeggen vanwege \"persoonlijke omstandigheden\". 74ste winnaar Uitgerekend Bosch ging dus gisteravond in Bangkok aan de haal met de titel. Zij kreeg de bijbehorende kroon uit handen van haar voorganger, de Deense Victoria Kjaer Theilvig. De tweede plaats was voor de Thaise Veena Praveenar Singh, derde werd Stephany Abasali uit Venezuela. Bosch is de 74ste winnaar van de Miss Universe-verkiezing. Het is een Amerikaans initiatief, maar de laatste jaren is het evenement in Mexicaanse en Thaise handen gekomen.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2591317","published_date":"2025-11-21T07:02:40","collected_date":"2025-11-21T12:54:04.495086","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":290,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2157,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.45,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Thailand","Miss Universe","Nawat Itsaragrisil","Nawat","Luister!"],"locations":["Thailand"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1901,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["organisator","Mexicaanse die uitbrander","De toekenning","een tumultueus","evenement","eerder deze maand","een rel","de verkiezing","een promotiebijeenkomst","alle kandidaten"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"organisator":4.0,"Mexicaanse die uitbrander":2.0,"De toekenning":1.0,"een tumultueus":1.0,"evenement":1.0,"eerder deze maand":1.0,"een rel":1.0,"de verkiezing":1.0,"een promotiebijeenkomst":1.0,"alle kandidaten":1.0}},"age_hours":5.987617668888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"7623b6b6857d73125dad1397f6f7ae77","title_md5":"8c296812646db549354b96730cf0de42","url_normalized":"28f8109dd22152f577718d1bfd5ed132","minhash_signature":["3328509","10092163","14366","12069829","498956","7618427","14786822","244275","693538","4729967","16626443","3207698","3162861","1166689","9281766","56890","434015","1929019","9722371","113500","1868191","88593","459618","1734341","6579678","1882961","14187664","10526923","7595772","7152514","3290860","6606854","3450576","2820767","8061975","880599","5241720","4533003","296674","20376078","3088334","13468950","2661647","1785966","3625657","2720336","1525015","1443639","1132398","10960816","2447249","843096","1225078","2819355","9904159","2364710","226173","2450436","4587058","4797292","1624634","1311296","6372115","957447","13568062","3789593","2322970","1563117","1210097","5493975","5676797","4143935","11438185","4002047","15858453","3487483","264176","2433691","11560535","10235303","301782","2330191","1292529","3999196","4904217","6694534","7112617","842875","2840755","8661640","7678043","2175767","1183835","1963002","5979754","1881726","2811152","11684906","2168581","158393","243170","15025984","3045718","2395720","129586","2932756","2193094","2447857","4478121","44001","10236295","5571685","1550051","76161","430364","2786430","120732","5419713","7663201","5757197","6123858","1560939","3114514","363706","10047967","1376388","9098556","16925190"],"title_minhash":["85460458","42841784","40079984","21491293","13624839","118331823","359518829","5407950","76881796","35144584","103497225","99612586","18524208","118551530","45071372","16765442","434015","38603746","9722371","113500","24053426","82022587","34606667","70719759","21393102","1882961","67906431","45815129","28655922","21147669","47839117","225706878","101981015","43743547","11556770","880599","174235225","8417789","11926597","27290270","164867374","69443625","49136923","40559476","11418190","27824875","1691750","41358520","51897052","86665719","72655453","969988","18850179","77757967","20409157","81019566","52585438","7750562","12978240","1151625","47928435","117566275","6372115","9364271","41883092","34501654","131606927","155700874","110404067","113250236","144211730","32985898","25879412","19721446","20836514","124823500","7082514","11712004","15027250","202587911","55389126","62408873","22131005","47586666","11728217","65725557","94416321","34980004","70492635","8661640","74538311","62095023","8261531","18836545","5979754","24163385","27715780","127865518","60438428","7840644","243170","25778533","26070556","44485894","52333678","58208387","37088309","47418031","182702272","182187170","28203945","134806422","63240800","4438756","38431345","93508566","25303395","13762129","46361349","85697317","69116401","17165896","45462023","1331506","112798410","11981119","29393718","87830305"],"combined_hash":"0f1c5cc9085acff8ee7c4f4bd142d38d"},"sentiment_score":1.3655,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7269,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7143,"joy":0.0202,"surprise":0.0914,"sadness":0.0288,"fear":0.0561,"anger":0.0606,"disgust":0.0286},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of machine learning models for predicting the performance of Oracle databases.
