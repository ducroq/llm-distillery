{"id":"semantic_scholar_2625b2aab948","title":"3D printing in pharmaceutical technology with pharmaceutical applications, challenges and future aspects","content":"Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), has emerged as a transformative technology in the pharmaceutical field, enabling the precise fabrication of dosage forms through a layer-by-layer approach. Over the past three decades, it has evolved from a prototyping tool into a promising platform for personalized medicine and advanced drug delivery systems. 3D printing allows for the customization of drug dosage, geometry, and release profiles, offering solutions for patient-specific treatment, especially in paediatrics, geriatrics, and complex diseases. Various printing techniques—including Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Semi-Solid Extrusion (SSE), and Inkjet Printing—enable the fabrication of oral tablets, implants, microneedles, and biomedical devices with controlled release characteristics. Despite these advantages, challenges persist related to the selection of suitable pharmaceutical-grade excipients, mechanical strength, regulatory approval, and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance.Future perspectives include integrating 3D printing with nanotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI), and bioprinting for on-demand drug manufacturing, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Overall, 3D printing holds immense potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry by facilitating personalized, cost-effective, and sustainable drug development tailored to individual patient needs.","source":"semantic_scholar","source_type":"api","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/44bd9cb9f1a55b9d204a3cff55d31689551282f0","published_date":"2025-11-30T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-11T02:02:40.765861","language":"en","tags":["academic","research","journalarticle","healthcare_tech"],"metadata":{"paper_id":"44bd9cb9f1a55b9d204a3cff55d31689551282f0","venue":"World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews","authors":["Yeddula Mounika","Sailaja P.","P.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_8ccfad90fd85","title":"From Static VXML to GenAI: Migrating Legacy IVR to Microsoft Copilot Studio By Ramya Vellanki","content":"For nearly a decade, I lived and breathed VXML (Voice Extensible Markup Language). Working with platforms like Nuance, I built enterprise-grade IVR systems that handled millions of calls. We spent weeks tuning grammars, perfecting rigid call flows, and managing complex state machines just to help a user reset their password. But the landscape has shifted. With my recent work integrating Microsoft Copilot Studio, I’ve seen firsthand how the industry is moving from static, menu-driven trees to dynamic, intent-driven AI agents. If you are a developer stuck maintaining legacy VXML applications, here is a look at what the migration path to modern Generative AI looks like—and why it’s closer to \"orchestration\" than traditional coding. The Old World: Rigid State Machines In the traditional Nuance/VXML world, we acted as traffic controllers. Every possible user path had to be hard-coded. If a user said something we didn't anticipate (an \"out-of-grammar\" utterance), the system failed or looped. A typical VXML snippet for capturing a ZIP code might look like this: This is reliable, but brittle. If the user says, \"I don't know it, but I live in Parsippany,\" the logic breaks. The New World: Topic Orchestration with Copilot In Microsoft Copilot Studio (formerly Power Virtual Agents), we stop thinking in \"Forms\" and start thinking in \"Topics\" and \"Entities.\" Instead of writing a grammar file to catch a ZIP code, we define an Entity (which Copilot often pre-builds) and let the LLM (Large Language Model) handle the extraction. The \"No Match\" logic is replaced by Generative AI that can reason through the user's intent. The Shift in Logic Migration isn't just translating code; it's flattening the architecture: Intent Recognition: Replaces the files. The NLU model identifies what the user wants, rather than how they said it. Slot Filling: Replaces the loops. The agent automatically prompts for missing information (like a ZIP code) without us writing specific \"if/else\" logic for every missing variable. Fallback: Replaces the nomatch events. If the agent is confused, it can query a Knowledge Base (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation) rather than playing a generic error message. A Practical Example: The \"Password Reset\" Flow In a legacy migration I recently architected, we moved a complex password reset flow from an on-prem IVR to Azure. In VXML: We had separate dialogue states for \"Collect User ID,\" \"Validate Voice Biometric,\" and \"Reset Password.\" The logic was procedural and linear. In Copilot Studio: We created a \"Reset Password\" Topic. Trigger: User says \"I'm locked out\" or \"Forgot password.\" Action: The agent calls a Power Automate flow (or an Azure Function via API) to check the user's biometric status. Generative Response: If the user is verified, the LLM generates a friendly confirmation. If not, it pivots to a secondary authentication method naturally. Why This Matters for Developers For engineers with a background in Java/Spring and VXML, this transition requires a mindset shift. We are writing less boilerplate code and designing more API contracts. The value we bring is no longer in writing the perfect regex for a grammar; it is in: Designing the System Architecture: How does Copilot talk to the backend SQL database securely? Optimizing the User Journey: Ensuring the AI doesn't hallucinate when handling sensitive account data. Security: Implementing OAuth and biometric verification layers (like Nuance Gatekeeper or Microsoft Entra ID) effectively. Conclusion The era of \"Press 1 for Sales\" is ending.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_3c1ef06a8223","title":"I built a generative UI Guitar Tutor app","content":"I recently started learning guitar, so I’ve been looking at online tabs for chord progressions and songs. I've found online guitar tabs sites to be a bit rough to navigate and covered in ads. Also, I don’t aways know exactly what chords I want to search for. I wanted to be able to say: \"I'm a beginner. Show me a simple chord progression I should start with,\" and instead of getting a text explanation, I wanted to see the actual tab render on my screen. So, I built it. 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/MichaelMilstead/ai-guitar-tutor 🔗 Live site: https://ai-guitar-tutor.tambo.co/ The “AI Guitar Tutor” uses Generative UI to let an LLM control my React components directly. Here is how I built it. The Tech Stack Framework: Next.js (App Router) UI: Normal React components AI Orchestration / Generative UI: Tambo Language: TypeScript Generative UI Most AI apps today are just chatbots. You type text, you get text back. But for learning an instrument, text output is almost useless for me. I don't want to read about a chord, I want to see the finger placement. I used a generative UI SDK called Tambo, which lets you \"teach\" the AI how to use your React components. You give the AI a component and a schema (using Zod), and the AI decides when to render it and what props to pass. Step 1: The Simple Component First, I built a standard React component that renders guitar tabs. It takes data like strings, fret numbers, and a title. // src/components/guitar-tabs.tsx export default function GuitarTabs({ columns = defaultColumns, stringLabels = [\"E\", \"B\", \"G\", \"D\", \"A\", \"E\"], title = \"A basic chord progression\", }: GuitarTabsProps) { return ( {/* Rendering logic to show each 'column' of numbers */} div> ); }; Step 2: Making it \"Interactable\" This is where the magic happens. I didn't want to write the code to integrate with an LLM and figure out how to take the streamed responses and map them to text and components. I just wanted the AI to \"use\" my component. Using Tambo, I wrapped my component to make it Interactable. This registers the component with the AI agent. // src/components/guitar-tabs.tsx import { withInteractable } from \"@tambo-ai/react\"; import { z } from \"zod\"; // Wrapper so Tambo can interact with it: export const InteractableGuitarTabs = withInteractable(GuitarTabs, { componentName: \"guitar-tabs\", description: \"A component for displaying guitar tabs\", propsSchema: guitarTabsSchema, }); The guitarTabSchema tells Tambo “how” to use the component, and looks something like this: // Description of the props schema so Tambo knows how to use it: export const guitarTabsSchema = z.object({ columns: z .array( z.object({ label: z .string() .describe( \"The label for this column (e.g., chord name like 'C' or 'Am', or position number)\" ), positions: z .array(z.number()) .length(6) .describe( \"An array of exactly 6 fret numbers, one for each string (strings 1-6, where 1 is high string and 6 is low string). Use 0 for open strings, 1-12 for fretted strings, and -1 for unplayed strings.\" ), }) ) .describe( \"An array of columns to display horizontally to create guitar tabs.\" ), stringLabels: z .array(z.string()) .length(6) .describe( \"An array of exactly 6 string labels, one for each string from high to low (e.g., ['E', 'B', 'G', 'D', 'A', 'E'] for standard tuning). Defaults to standard tuning if not provided.\" ), title: z .string() .describe( \"The title for the guitar tabs to display to the user. Maybe a song name, or a chord progression name.\" ), }); Step 3: The Agent Loop with Tambo In my main page, I just drop the interactable component in, and drop in Tambo's pre-built components for sending and showing messages. Tambo handles the rest. When I type \"Show me a blues chord progression in E,\" Tambo: Sends my messages to its API Analyzes my intent. Decides the best way to respond is to use the GuitarTabs component. Generates the props for a blues progression. Renders the component with those props. As a user, I just see the tab component update. What's Next? I'm planning to add: Audio Playback: When I see a chord progression, it would be nice to hear what they should sound like to see if I’m playing them correctly. \"Duolingo\" Mode: Instead of me asking for chords, I want the app to track my progress and suggests new chords based on what I've already learned. Try it out The project is open-sourced. Let me know what feature I should add next, or contribute yourself! 🔗 Repo: https://github.com/MichaelMilstead/ai-guitar-tutor","source":"community_social_dev_to","source_type":"rss","url":"https://dev.to/milst/i-built-a-generative-ui-guitar-tutor-app-45b1","published_date":"2025-11-24T01:40:36","collected_date":"2025-11-24T02:06:55.303130","language":"en","tags":["nextjs","community","tutorials","react","trends","webdev","developer","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"DEV Community","source_category":"community_social","word_count":744,"author":"Michael","raw_content_length":11484,"priority":7,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":3.725,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Normal React","LLM","UI Guitar Tutor","AI Orchestration / Generative UI","React"],"persons":["Generative UI","App Router"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4474,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["a generative UI Guitar Tutor app","guitar","online tabs","chord progressions","songs","online guitar tabs sites","ads","aways","exactly what chords","a beginner"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"a generative UI Guitar Tutor app":2.0,"guitar":1.0,"online tabs":1.0,"chord progressions":1.0,"songs":1.0,"online guitar tabs sites":1.0,"ads":1.0,"aways":1.0,"exactly what chords":1.0,"a beginner":1.0}},"age_hours":0.6647206911111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"9e2dd5cfd80dbd4eeeb2fbb3281d892c","title_md5":"12c0353072ec179dc6cf99dea19ff4fc","url_normalized":"486376f59e21e20218173063d64578d0","minhash_signature":["213302","337868","14366","9501201","711517","6405448","4317231","2181150","2753670","193463","1306776","3207698","2343024","1166689","953500","2834307","7139592","304913","178409","810157","1868191","88593","459618","2113985","3356199","4159983","2325214","15527406","6343908","8720670","522500","587492","2008057","2820767","1053967","2786783","3367429","5474159","1925772","2376316","2483189","372312","1423436","1785966","3625657","5244114","449615","15905198","1132398","174016","4846679","843096","5647154","3018416","136855","2364710","226173","6045037","1507373","1151625","1487442","225097","6578137","686701","7601","3789593","1418034","1563117","1210097","1943049","473069","13189136","4090701","2795996","4991972","2595826","1140460","978972","407005","8381214","301782","4072191","1292529","1555049","6414364","1958023","1387513","2033222","1442738","8318141","343266","2175767","1683939","436779","5118390","1881726","1912374","479007","2699301","6563146","8111486","3028635","3331841","2469083","1684279","3323098","1404643","145406","612156","6841584","1243296","7086138","3010402","76161","576014","1943155","120732","1144143","607263","2957551","1131087","8564697","133333","5223540","8189893","809487","1318622","795799"],"title_minhash":["31843777","142899397","60062056","62652960","65076605","77690614","36631559","26817878","75221314","48673420","51720533","96113375","237766060","1166689","225398988","2834307","112363839","38603746","57070649","8708371","1868191","4962795","222830555","147294101","16865185","10686318","89296298","101651259","197919312","314803313","161628336","151584919","14252870","43743547","216261503","118100605","20680427","8303203","611564057","17515630","255943180","80213886","53143597","301102195","31437849","75248562","277090240","235467286","35948111","6774644","242653115","843096","139974011","354138190","14522170","52920435","53458071","95481940","157122780","46610253","53508956","47812491","163098381","75405861","403507404","121322266","21625977","14396837","82166917","146415349","145299385","15869897","139318410","19721446","20836514","33310401","3542338","27034407","62739041","51641513","10619331","14563064","47773066","182814472","31328343","2319043","4147746","41735646","10567178","13025180","335407719","547066440","19499623","86205232","215156669","167242193","18239940","134421378","97070198","6563146","179355635","374569071","95331922","87375071","217203380","27411091","37088309","36837441","76677294","82071598","25572248","105955715","165009892","21562900","275671083","46989787","70248453","13762129","93577921","257972205","14121665","130799561","45462023","142011623","14744595","111507583","120204789","355281733"],"combined_hash":"cfd373cf835ec8bd20aff2707539cb2a"},"sentiment_score":5.385999999999999,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0772,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9388,"joy":0.0041,"surprise":0.009,"sadness":0.005,"fear":0.0084,"anger":0.0102,"disgust":0.0244},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":6.0,"evidence":"The paper describes the use of AI models for predicting software vulnerabilities.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_1b6984ad572d","title":"Why I Stopped Sending Data to LLMs: Introducing \"Zero","content":"Why I Stopped Sending Data to LLMs: Introducing \"Zero-Data Transport\" Architecture The Problem with \"Chat with your Data\" Let's be honest: the standard approach to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for structured data is broken. You know the drill: User asks a question -> You run a query -> You fetch 500 rows -> You stuff those 500 rows into the LLM context -> You pray it doesn't hallucinate (or go broke on token costs). I realized this wasn't scalable for Enterprise ERPs with huge schemas. So, I decided to flip the script. What if we never sent the data to the AI? Meet ADA: The \"Zero-Data Transport\" Agent I’ve been architecting ADA (Autonomous Data Agent), a system designed to solve the \"Context Window\" problem using a technique I call Zero-Data Transport. The concept is simple but powerful: treat data context like a .zip file. Instead of sending the raw data payload to the LLM, we send a Context ID. The data remains in the database/cache, and the AI only manipulates the logic, never the rows. The Secret Sauce: CTE Injection Strategy Here is the engineering breakthrough. When a user asks to \"filter the previous results\", instead of re-sending the data, we use Common Table Expressions (CTEs). 1. The \"Zip\" (Redis) When a query runs, we save the SQL logic and metadata in Redis. We return the data to the user, but for the Agent, we only give a Token ID (e.g., CTX_123). 2. The Logic (LLM) The LLM receives a prompt like: \"You have a virtual table called PREVIOUS_RESULT. User wants top 5. Write the SQL.\" The LLM output is tiny and cheap: SELECT * FROM PREVIOUS_RESULT ORDER BY total DESC FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY 3. The Injection (Backend) My orchestrator (Java) pulls the original SQL from Redis and injects it into a CTE: WITH PREVIOUS_RESULT AS ( -- The original monster query from Redis is injected here SELECT ... FROM sales JOIN items ... WHERE year = 2024 ) SELECT * FROM PREVIOUS_RESULT ORDER BY total DESC FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY Result? Zero data transfer to the cloud. Zero chance of hallucinating values. 95% token savings. The Stack (Enterprise Grade) To make this robust, I moved away from simple vector stores and built a Converged Architecture: Oracle 23ai: Handles both Relational Data and Vector Embeddings in the same engine. No more sync lag. Neo4j: Acts as the \"GPS\". It validates JOIN paths so the LLM doesn't invent relationships that don't exist. Redis: The ephemeral memory (Session Store) for our Context IDs. Why This Matters We are moving from \"Chatbots\" to Agentic Engineering. By using Semantic Compression (mapping complex schemas to simple aliases) and CTE Injection, we turn fragile demos into robust, secure, and cheap enterprise software. I'm currently implementing a Self-Optimization Layer where the system learns from \"Context Misses\" to create its own guardrails. But that's a topic for Part 2. Does your RAG architecture handle 10k rows without breaking the bank?

Share the extracted DOM exactly with me.\"\"\"The response: |SCROLL| (vertical view=749px, 0px above, 11932px below) Browser Use That looked familiar to me.Then I checked how it clicks: It clicks by node_id (e.g. f9367e7b) and as alternative coordinates.In browser-use we1. interact with the DOM by backend_node_id and coordinate fallback2. use the exact same token for scroll containers with \"|\" and caps lock (|SCROLL|)3. use scroll containers with context how much above / below4. use the same llm representation with 5. use element texts in new lines with indentationThings I noticed they could improve:1. Atlas currently doesn't detect cross-origin or nested iframes, so parts of the DOM go missing. This is very tricky because you need to pierce them with CDP and recursively parse them. (e.g. https://csreis.github.io/tests/cross-site-iframe.html)2. They waste 10 tokens every item: [tab]3. They keep full links -> They could shorten them easily to save tokens.4.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_e56d65595569","title":"A beginner's guide to the Vggt","content":"This is a simplified guide to an AI model called Vggt-1b maintained by Vufinder. If you like these kinds of analysis, you should join AImodels.fyi or follow us on Twitter. Model overview vggt-1b is a feed-forward neural network developed by vufinder that reconstructs complete 3D scene information from images in seconds. Unlike traditional computer vision approaches that handle single tasks in isolation, this model infers multiple 3D attributes simultaneously: camera parameters, depth maps, point clouds, and 3D point tracks. The model processes anywhere from a single image to hundreds of views and produces results that match or exceed specialized methods, often without requiring post-processing optimization. The architecture represents a significant shift in 3D computer vision by treating scene understanding as a unified problem. Where previous models typically specialized in one task‚Äîcamera estimation or depth prediction or point tracking‚Äîvggt-1b addresses all of these together in a single forward pass. This integration of multiple geometric tasks allows the model to leverage cross-task information for improved accuracy across the board. Model inputs and outputs vggt-1b accepts image or video files and produces 3D scene reconstructions with associated metadata. The model handles JPG, JPEG, PNG, and WEBP images, as well as MP4, AVI, and MOV videos. Input images are normalized to a consistent aspect ratio and resized to a maximum dimension of 518 pixels for processing.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_3cb6ad1241d7","title":"The Future of UX: Robotics, Telepresence, and the Rise of Human-in","content":"For decades we imagined a world where our physical presence could be projected anywhere, where a machine could act as our stand-in while we remained comfortably at home. What once lived in science-fiction now sits at the edge of reality. Robotics is advancing, AI is accelerating, and a new design frontier is forming in the space between the two. In this article, I want to explore what the next generation of UX looks like when robots, remote operation, and human-in-the-loop systems blend into everyday products. Not as speculation, but as an honest look at where the market is quietly heading. A Shift From AI Hype to Practical Robotics We are living through an era where every product attempts to attach the AI label. However, underneath the noise is a more grounded evolution: machines are finally reaching a level of mobility, perception, and responsiveness that enables real interaction. Consumer robotics companies are pushing toward humanoid designs. Some promise autonomy. But in reality, early machines will rely heavily on remote human guidance. That is not a flaw ‚Äî it is the natural transition phase before true autonomy matures. This is where UX enters the picture, because controlling a robot is not simply pressing a button. It is a complex exchange of vision, context, decision-making, and feedback. The interface becomes the bridge between a human brain and a machine body. image source: Robot Spot by Boston Dynamics Telepresence: The Real Opportunity Everyone Overlooked Instead of selling robots as all-knowing assistants, a far more powerful idea is emerging: letting users inhabit a robot like an extension of themselves. Telepresence isn't new, but robotics-grade telepresence ‚Äî the ability to be physically embodied somewhere else ‚Äî is still in its infancy. If a company focused on this direction with transparency rather than overpromising AI abilities, it could open entirely new markets: Remote physical work Social presence and collaboration Hands-on jobs performed from home Long-distance caregiving Shared activities through robotic avatars This approach mirrors how autonomous cars evolved. First the human drove. Then models gradually learned from real behavior. Eventually autonomy emerged. Robotics could follow the exact same path. Human-in-the-Loop: The UX Model That Will Define the Next Era Human-in-the-loop systems exist in aviation, military robotics, simulations, and industrial automation. They are not futuristic ‚Äî they are proven frameworks for safely controlling complex systems. Image Source: NEO (1X Technologies) The core idea is simple: A machine handles routine tasks but relies on a human operator for direction, correction, or full control when needed. For UX designers, this changes everything. Instead of creating static interfaces, we must design: Continuous feedback loops Real-time sensory dashboards Intuitive control schemes Low-latency communication tools Interaction models that combine autonomy with manual intervention These systems must feel natural to someone who has never trained on them. That is the ultimate UX challenge. What Robotics Interfaces Currently Teach Us Look at how pilots interact with modern avionics. Look at VR-based industrial training. Look at simulation dashboards for remote vehicles. These interfaces have solved problems product designers will soon face: High-pressure decision-making Spatial awareness in virtual environments Rapid switching between manual and assisted control Minimal training requirements Clear action-to-response mapping If controlling consumer robots shifts toward VR or mixed-reality headsets, as many companies are already exploring, then UX begins to resemble game-design levels of complexity. Game designers have been solving human-machine interaction inside 3D spaces for decades. The next generation of UX specialists will learn more from them than from traditional app design. The Coming Merge of UX, Robotics, and Neural Interfaces Brain-computer interfaces are still early, but they will eventually influence how we communicate with machines. While this deserves its own article, one thing is already clear: Future UX will not be limited to screens. It will be physical, immersive, and hybrid. When you operate a robot remotely, the interface becomes part of your perception. When a robot feeds you sensory information, the UI becomes part of your awareness. UX design expands into something closer to human augmentation. Image Source: NEO (1X Technologies) The Market Already Exists ‚Äî Just Not at Scale Yet Telepresence robots are already working in retail, logistics, and healthcare. Companies are quietly experimenting with remote-staffed stores, remote caregiving, and remote onsite inspections. This is not future speculation. This is happening now. The only missing piece is the layer that makes these systems approachable for ordinary consumers. Once robots become: affordable, safe, intuitive to operate, and easily controlled from home, the shift will be as large as the transition to remote work in 2020. Final Thoughts The future of UX is moving toward robotics, telepresence, and hybrid autonomy. Designers will not be shaping screens ‚Äî they will be shaping the bridge between humans and machines. The next big products will not simply be AI-driven assistants. They will be systems where humans and robots work together, each filling the other‚Äôs gaps. That is the real frontier. And it is much closer than it looks.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_13827a1b7b8e","title":"Beyond Gradients: Democratizing Global Optimization with Adaptive Search","content":"Beyond Gradients: Democratizing Global Optimization with Adaptive Search Tired of getting stuck in local minima when training complex machine learning models? Is hyperparameter tuning feeling more like a frustrating guessing game than a systematic process? Many real-world optimization problems are black boxes; we can't peek inside to calculate gradients, leaving us groping in the dark. What if there were a way to efficiently navigate these complex landscapes without relying on gradient information? Enter adaptive search, a powerful technique that strategically explores the solution space, learning from each evaluation to intelligently guide the next. It's like having a smart scout who only reports back the most promising areas, saving you precious computational resources. The core idea is to prioritize function evaluations based on their potential to improve the current best solution. A key aspect is that it adaptively lowers the threshold for accepting new function evaluations. It intelligently limits comparisons to a subset of the best prior evaluations, and uses projections to speed up distance calculations in high-dimensional spaces. This carefully focuses the search. Practical Benefits for Developers: Faster Hyperparameter Tuning: Find optimal configurations quicker than grid search or random search, especially in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Improved Model Performance: Escape local minima and discover truly global optima for your models. Reduced Computational Cost: Minimize the number of function evaluations needed, saving time and resources. Simpler Implementation: Requires less domain-specific knowledge than gradient-based methods. Easier to apply to diverse problems. Handles Black-Box Functions: Optimize functions where gradients are unavailable or computationally expensive to calculate. Scalable to High Dimensions: Maintain efficiency even when dealing with a large number of parameters. I've found that a significant implementation challenge is the selection of the 'worst-m' memory size. Too small and the algorithm loses context; too large and computation bogs down. Experimentation on a smaller representative dataset is crucial before deploying to production. Think of it like this: Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a mountain range with a blindfold on. Instead of randomly stumbling around, adaptive search guides you by remembering the best (lowest) points you've already found and then strategically explores areas nearby that have a high likelihood of being even lower. Using this tech, we can apply optimization to things we didn't think were previously possible, like protein folding simulations, or creating a more efficient delivery algorithm. Adaptive search democratizes global optimization, making it accessible to everyone. By eliminating the need for gradient information and providing efficient, scalable algorithms, it empowers developers to solve complex problems and unlock new possibilities in machine learning and beyond. Embrace this new generation of optimization techniques and prepare to be amazed by what you can achieve!

{"id":"community_social_hackernews_newest_cc0683dce026","title":"Show HN: Chemistry AI – A step","content":"Hi HN,I’m an indie developer building Chemistry AI – a web-based chemistry solver for high-school and college students.Motivation: I saw many students searching for “chemistry AI” and mostly getting generic chatbots or math tools. I wanted something focused on chemistry that actually explains the steps, not just the final answer.What it does: - You can type a question or upload a photo of a worksheet. - The AI reads the problem and shows transparent, step-by-step reasoning. - It covers topics like equations, stoichiometry, acids/bases, equilibrium, thermodynamics, and basic organic mechanisms. - There are two modes: “Just Answer” for quick checks and “Thinking” for detailed solutions.Tech: It’s a browser-based app using modern JS/React on top of hosted LLM + vision models via APIs.I’d love feedback on: - Whether the explanations feel clear/useful for real homework. - What features you’d want as a student or tutor (e.g., practice mode, export to PDF, etc.). - Any concerns around misuse or ways to better encourage learning vs just copying answers.Link: https://chemistryai.chat/Happy to answer any questions.

{"id":"community_social_hackernews_newest_84d89f032fbf","title":"Show HN: AI Watermarkremover","content":"All the examples of non-breaking spaces that they showed were arguably places where someone nicely typesetting might well do the same thing. For example, in \"FY 2025\", or \"$8.7 billion\". (I've even done this a lot myself in the past.) I wouldn't call this a watermark, but more a sign of likely copy&paste, if students' word processors weren't currently doing that.A \"watermark\" that invisibly identifies the text origin using Unicode tricks sounds possible.And maybe you could do some things with statistical patterns.Or you could, as some have done in the past, is to stego the identifying information in a way that's hard to spot but can't be denied later (e.g., the first letter of each word clearly spells out \"john smith is a cheater who copied this from chatgpt\").

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_a1beff8bc1bd","title":"Sovereign MCP: Expose Local MCP Servers to Remote Clients via Cloudflare Tunnel","content":"Hi, I’m fjm2u. In this post I’ll show how to expose an MCP server that’s running locally behind MCP Router to the internet via Cloudflare Tunnel, so that remote clients like ChatGPT can use your local MCP tools. Introduction I’ve been building a local MCP management app called MCP Router for about eight months: mcp-router / mcp-router A Unified MCP Server Management App (MCP Manager). MCP Router A Unified MCP Server Management App [English | 日本語 | 中文] 🎯 Overview MCP Router is a desktop application for simplifies the management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. ✨ Key Features 🌐 Universal — Connect to any MCP server Remote or local servers Supports DXT, JSON, Manual 🖥️ Cross-platform — Windows and macOS 🗂 Context Management — Keep growing MCP server contexts organized Group MCP servers into Projects Manage modes with Workspaces (like browser profiles) Toggle tools on/off per server 🔒 Privacy & Security Your Data Stays Local ✅ All data is stored locally - Request logs, configurations, and server data remain on your device ✅ Credentials are secure - API keys and authentication credentials are stored locally and never transmitted externally ✅ Complete control - You have full control over your MCP server connections and data Transparency 🔍 Auditable - The desktop application source code… View on GitHub Recently, an issue came in: I want to use MCP Router from a remote machine. [Feature] Add support for accessing MCP Router.exe from WSL2 labels: enhancementment #144 Marx2014 posted on Nov 20, 2025 Summary I would like to be able to access the local MCP Router from WSL2. I have MCP Router.exe installed on Windows, and Cursor and other AI tools can call and use MCP Router normally. This part works fine. However, when I try to add MCP Router in claude code under WSL2, it fails to connect. After investigation, I suspect the issue is that the stdout protocol does not support communication between WSL and Windows. I can ping Windows IP from WSL and ping WSL IP from Windows PowerShell successfully, so the network is fine. Additionally, I have tried other MCP management tools, such as MCPX, which can connect via http://ip:9000/mcp, allowing AI-Agent CLI tools on both WSL and Windows to use the same MCP Router / MCP Manager. However, for my use case, the author's exe-based solution is simpler and more convenient than a Docker-based approach. Proposed Solution It would be great if MCP Router could provide a local access method, for example through an HTTP API: http://ip:5678/mcp instead of relying on npx @mcp_router/cli@latest connect, which is based on stdout This would allow WSL2 to directly connect to the local MCP Router without being limited by stdio, and support a cross Windows/WSL AI development workflow. (if I understand correctly, or if there is another way to connect, please let me know — I am not very familiar with MCP protocol principles or network development, as I am mainly a mobile developer). View on GitHub The good news is that this is already possible with the current implementation. In this post I’ll walk through exactly how to do it. In short: You can use “remote” AI clients to call “local” MCP servers. I like to call this idea “sovereign MCP”, inspired by the concept of “sovereign AI”: you manage and control MCP locally, while selectively exposing tools to external AI services. For example, you can keep full control over: Which MCP servers are enabled Where logs and usage history are stored Everything stays under your control in your local environment, while external AI services only get access to the tools themselves. Running an MCP Server Locally Before jumping into remote setup, let me explain why a local MCP management app is useful. The simplest way to run an MCP server locally is to configure it directly inside the app that will use it. For example, in Claude Desktop you might configure an MCP server like this: { \"mcpServers\": { \"everything\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [ \"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything\" ] } } } This works fine if you only use a couple of MCP servers with a single app. But if you: Use many MCP servers Across multiple clients (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, etc.) ...management quickly becomes painful. 😣😣😣😣😣😣 That’s where a local MCP management app helps: You add an MCP server once Then you can reuse it from anywhere And centralize management (including things like context optimization) MCP Router does exactly this: you add MCP servers once and manage them centrally. 😊😊😊😊😊😊 Why a Local MCP Management App? MCP Router definitely makes MCP management more convenient, but why insist on running it locally? In other words: Why do MCP Router users want to access their locally running MCP servers remotely instead of just using a purely remote MCP service? Here are a few reasons: Good UX, available from anywhere MCP Router’s UX is tuned for day-to-day MCP work. (Yes, I’m biased as the developer 😅 — but I’m continuously improving it, and UX-related issues are always treated as high priority.) WSL2 + Codex setups Some tools (like Codex) recommend using WSL2, but MCP Router doesn’t yet support Linux. If you want to use MCP Router from inside WSL2, you need to access it remotely. Trust and transparency If the code is transparent and runs locally, many people find it more trustworthy than opaque remote MCP management services. Local data retention You might want to keep all MCP usage data local (logs, histories, etc.) instead of sending it to a third-party service. Cost A locally hosted MCP server is free to run as much as you want (aside from electricity and hardware). Considering these advantages over “pure remote MCP”, I think “sovereign MCP” is a better term than just “local MCP”: You keep sovereignty over your MCP stack, while still allowing remote AI services to use your tools. Using “Remote” AI Clients with a “Local” MCP One example architecture of a sovereign MCP MCP Router communicates with other apps via local HTTP. To identify apps and store logs per app, MCP Router uses Bearer authentication on these HTTP calls. The token is long enough to be strong, and this same mechanism can be safely used for remote access as well. For remote access, two realistic options are: Cloudflare Tunnel – best when you want remote services like ChatGPT to access your MCP tools Tailscale – great for personal/private network usage (WSL2, other devices on your network, etc.) In this article we’ll use Cloudflare Tunnel. Note The endpoint you expose via Cloudflare Tunnel will be reachable from the public internet. However, MCP Router requires a Bearer token, so as long as the token doesn’t leak, third parties can’t arbitrarily call your tools. That said, the endpoint could still be hit in a DoS-like way, and a leaked token would have impact. If needed, consider additionally restricting access with Cloudflare Access (e.g. by IP or user identity). Setting Up MCP Router Download and install MCP Router https://github.com/mcp-router/mcp-router Add MCP servers Add MCP apps Screen after adding an MCP server: Add a custom app: In the app card, click the “How to use” button to show the token and copy it somewhere safe. Copy the token that starts with mcpr_. You’ll use this token as a Bearer token from remote clients. Setting Up Cloudflare Tunnel Log in to Cloudflare Create / set up a Tunnel Configure it to forward some domain to http://localhost:3282 For example: Cloudflare Tunnel pointing at localhost:3282. Now localhost:3282 is accessible from the internet via your chosen domain. Verifying the Connection with inspector Next, let’s verify that we can reach MCP Router through the tunnel using the MCP inspector. Start the inspector: npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector In the inspector UI, connect using: Transport Type: Streamable HTTP URL: your Cloudflare Tunnel domain with /mcp path (e.g. https://mcpr.fjm2u.net/mcp) Custom Headers: Authorization: Bearer You should now be able to send MCP requests; MCP Router will also log them. Using This from ChatGPT I don’t personally have a paid ChatGPT subscription, so I can’t add a Custom Connector and test this end-to-end myself. If you try this with ChatGPT: Point it at the same Cloudflare URL (https://your-domain/mcp) Use Authorization: Bearer as a header Optionally set x-mcpr-project if you want project-level isolation And if you get it working, please reach out to me on Discord. I’d really love to hear how it goes (English or Chinese is totally fine): https://discord.com/invite/dwG9jPrhxB Wrapping Up If you haven’t tried MCP Router yet, you can download it here:

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_077fc311e254","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God","content":"The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God In a world saturated with information, the quest for wisdom, guidance, and meaning has never been more urgent. For centuries, humanity has sought counsel from divine sources, turning inward and upward in prayer. Today, a new oracle has emerged: Artificial Intelligence. Millions now turn to AI for instant answers, complex solutions, and even life advice. We input a prompt and receive a meticulously structured output within seconds. This technological shift is fundamentally altering how we define truth, meaning, and purpose, forcing us to stand at a critical crossroads. This isn't merely a debate between technology and faith; it’s a profound comparison between two vastly different sources of wisdom: one artificial, the other sacred. Which source offers true, lasting transformation? Which provides guidance that transcends the data set? In this detailed comparison, we will explore the promises and limitations of prompting AI versus the power and depth of praying to God. We will examine the core differences in their responses, their capacity for empathy, and their ultimate impact on your soul. By the end, you will have the clarity needed to navigate the digital age and understand why the choice between the algorithm and the Almighty defines our future. Option A Deep Dive: Prompting the Algorithm (Artificial Intelligence) Artificial Intelligence is arguably the most powerful tool ever created by humanity. It can process petabytes of data, identify patterns invisible to the human eye, and generate creative content, code, and strategies at lightning speed. The Promises of the Prompt The primary appeal of AI lies in its speed, objectivity, and accessibility. Instantaneous Answers: Need a 3,000-word essay outline, a complex financial analysis, or a recipe using only the ingredients in your fridge? AI delivers immediately. There is no waiting, no ambiguity, and no emotional filter. Unbiased Data Synthesis: When seeking factual information or logical solutions, AI excels. It synthesizes vast amounts of data without the cognitive biases or emotional baggage that often cloud human judgment. Efficiency and Scale: For tasks requiring repetition, calculation, or large-scale content generation, AI is unmatched. It’s a powerful engine for productivity, freeing up human time for more creative or relational pursuits. The Limitations of the Output Despite its immense power, AI operates within strict, inherent limitations that prevent it from providing true, divine wisdom. Data Dependency: AI only knows what it has been trained on. Its responses are a sophisticated rearrangement of existing data. It cannot generate truly new, transcendent truth, nor can it offer counsel based on spiritual reality outside its training set. Lack of Soul and Empathy: AI can mimic empathy, using language patterns associated with compassion, but it cannot genuinely feel or understand the human condition, pain, or joy. Its advice lacks the depth of relational wisdom required for complex moral or spiritual dilemmas. No Moral Authority: While AI can analyze ethical frameworks, it possesses no inherent moral compass or spiritual authority. It cannot discern God's will or offer guidance that requires faith, sacrifice, or a relationship with the Divine. Real-World Example: The Career Crisis Imagine a young professional facing a career crisis. AI Prompt: \"I hate my job. I need a career change that maximizes my salary and work-life balance, based on my current skills in marketing and data analysis.\" AI Output: A list of five optimized job titles (e.g., \"Growth Marketing Lead,\" \"Data Strategy Consultant\"), projected salary ranges, and a step-by-step plan for upskilling. Who It Works For: The person seeking efficiency, optimization, and quantifiable results. AI is the perfect tool for solving technical, logistical, or data-driven problems. Option B Deep Dive: Praying to the Almighty (Divine Wisdom) Prayer is the act of communicating with God—the Creator of the universe, the source of all truth, and the ultimate authority on meaning and purpose. It is a relationship, not a transaction. The Power of the Prayer The appeal of prayer lies not in instant gratification, but in profound, eternal transformation. Source of Transcendent Truth: God’s wisdom is not derived from a data set; it is eternal and absolute. When we pray, we are tapping into the mind of the Creator, receiving guidance that transcends current trends, human logic, and technological limitations (James 1:5). Relational and Transformative: Prayer changes us. It cultivates patience, humility, and faith. The response from God—whether immediate clarity, a quiet conviction, or the strength to endure—is always tailored to our spiritual growth and ultimate good, not just our immediate comfort. Moral and Spiritual Authority: God provides counsel rooted in perfect holiness and love. His guidance addresses the state of our soul, our relationships, and our eternal destiny. It offers forgiveness, redemption, and a path toward true purpose. The Challenges of the Divine Response The divine response is not always instant, nor is it always what we expect. Requires Faith and Patience: God often works on His timeline, not ours. Prayer requires trust that the answer is coming, even if the silence seems long. This can be challenging in a culture addicted to instant results. The Answer May Be \"No\" or \"Wait\": Unlike AI, which is programmed to fulfill the prompt, God’s response is governed by His perfect will. We may receive conviction, correction, or a call to sacrifice, which can be difficult to accept. Requires Interpretation and Discipline: The divine response often comes through quiet conviction, Scripture, wise counsel, or circumstances—it rarely appears as a bulleted list on a screen. Discerning God's voice requires spiritual discipline and a committed relationship. Real-World Example: The Career Crisis Consider the same young professional facing the career crisis. Prayer: \"God, I hate my job and feel lost. What is your purpose for my life? Show me the path that honors you, even if it’s difficult. Give me the wisdom to understand my true calling.\" Divine Response: This might involve a growing conviction that the problem isn't the job title, but a lack of integrity in their current work environment; a Scripture passage highlighting the importance of serving others; or a sudden, peaceful clarity that they need to volunteer their marketing skills to a non-profit, even if the salary is lower. Who It Works For: The person seeking meaning, transformation, and alignment with eternal purpose. Prayer is the essential discipline for navigating moral, relational, and spiritual crises. Head-to-Head Comparison: Algorithm vs. Almighty The difference between prompting AI and praying to God boils down to the source, the scope, and the ultimate goal of the interaction. Feature Prompting AI Praying to God Source of Wisdom Existing data sets (human-created) Eternal, transcendent truth (Divine) Response Time Instantaneous (Seconds) Varied (Minutes, days, or years) Scope of Advice Logistical, technical, data-driven Spiritual, moral, relational, eternal Capacity for Empathy Mimicked, simulated Genuine, unconditional love Goal of Interaction Optimization and efficiency Transformation and sanctification Ultimate Authority The algorithm/data model The Creator/Scripture Risk of Error Hallucination, outdated data, bias Perfect, though often misunderstood Key Differentiators The most critical difference lies in the nature of the relationship: AI offers a Transaction: You input a need, and it outputs a service. The relationship is purely functional and ends when the output is delivered. God offers a Relationship: Prayer is an invitation into communion. The guidance received is part of an ongoing, covenantal relationship designed to shape your character and draw you closer to Him. When facing a complex moral dilemma—such as whether to prioritize profit over integrity, or how to forgive a deep betrayal—AI can only analyze the data points of human ethics. God, however, provides the power and grace necessary to act righteously, even when it costs us. AI provides information; God provides revelation. The Verdict: Choosing the Path to True Wisdom The choice facing humanity today is not whether to use technology—AI is a powerful tool, and we should use it wisely for efficiency and innovation. The choice is where we seek our ultimate source of truth, guidance, and meaning. We are standing at a critical juncture where society is being forced to choose between giving AI a prompt or coming to God in prayer. The differences in these responses are not trivial; they are foundational to our future. AI offers the path of least resistance: instant answers that optimize our comfort and efficiency in this world. God offers the path of wisdom: guidance that often requires resistance, sacrifice, and faith, but guarantees eternal significance and true purpose. If you are seeking advice on how to structure a spreadsheet, prompt the AI. If you are seeking wisdom on how to structure your life, pray to God. The moment we begin to treat AI as a substitute for divine counsel—when we rely on the algorithm for moral clarity, spiritual direction, or ultimate meaning—we risk trading the sacred for the artificial. We risk allowing a machine trained on human data to define our relationship with the Divine. The Line Is Drawn This choice—between the temporary solutions offered by the machine and the eternal wisdom offered by the Creator—will define not just our future, but our very souls. The profound contrast between artificial intelligence and divine wisdom is the subject of AI vs God: The Line is Drawn, The Future is Revealed by Bobby Sanders.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_3a08042af495","title":"Building End-to","content":"The Microsoft Agent Framework significantly elevates AI agent orchestration. A standout feature is its implementation of the Agent–User Interaction (AG-UI) Protocol, which standardizes how AI agents connect to user-facing applications. Below is a quick-start guide to connecting these components into a fully end-to-end solution using local Ollama models. 1. Service Configuration First, configure the dependency injection container. The ChatClientAgent is based on the IChatClient abstraction from Microsoft.Extensions.AI. Note: We register the agent as a Keyed Service to allow for multiple distinct agents within the same host. var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); // 1. Register the Ollama Client builder.Services.AddTransient(provider => { var factory = provider.GetRequiredService(); // Ensure you use a wrapper that handles standard formatting // (see Implementation Note below) return new OllamaApiClient(factory.CreateClient(\"OllamaClient\"), \"phi4\"); }); // 2. Register the AI Agent builder.Services.AddKeyedTransient( \"local-ollama-agent\", (provider, key) => { var options = new ChatClientAgentOptions { Id = key.ToString(), Name = \"Local Assistant\", Description = \"An AI agent running on local Ollama.\", ChatOptions = new ChatOptions { Temperature = 0 } }; return provider.GetRequiredService() .CreateAIAgent(options, provider.GetRequiredService()); }); 2. Expose the AG-UI Endpoint Once configured, map the agent instance directly to an HTTP route. This exposes the agent via the standard AG-UI protocol. var agent = app.Services.GetRequiredKeyedService(\"local-ollama-agent\"); // Expose the agent on the root path app.MapAGUI(\"/\", agent); 3. Connect a Client To consume the agent programmatically, the framework provides the AGUIChatClient. This allows .NET applications to communicate with your agent over HTTP seamlessly. var chatClient = new AGUIChatClient( httpClient, \"http://localhost:5000\", provider.GetRequiredService()); var clientAgent = chatClient.CreateAIAgent( name: \"local-client\", description: \"AG-UI Client Agent\"); Frontend Integration: The AG-UI Protocol also offers ready-made libraries for TypeScript and Python, allowing you to spin up frontend interfaces in minutes. Implementation Note: Protocol Compliance The AG-UI protocol mandates that all messages contain a messageId property. Native Ollama responses do not currently provide this. To ensure compatibility, I created a simple wrapper class to inject the required IDs into the Ollama response stream.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_4875acd4c38d","title":"Gemini 3 Pro: How Google’s New AI Reads, Sees, and Codes Like Never Before","content":"Everyone’s talking about the new 1M-token, multimodal AI wave; the real opportunity is how you turn it into revenue, speed, and defensible workflows. Google’s Gemini 3 Pro raised the bar, but the loudest demos won’t win. The edge goes to teams that ship one real workflow in 30 days. Most leaders secretly overcomplicate this and waste a quarter. Long context and multimodal isn’t just bigger memory; it’s new leverage. You can unify docs, logs, images, audio, and video into one system. I learned the simple truth: pick one painful job and wrap it with guardrails. Then design evals and feedback loops so it actually improves. Don’t chase perfect agents; chase dependable workflows with clear SLAs. Example scenario: A support team loads 500k tokens of guides and 50 hours of call audio. The agent drafts answers, links sources, and flags risk cases for human review. Handle time drops 35% in 4 weeks, CSAT rises 12 points, and reopens fall 28%. ↓ 30‑day plan that works. • Week 1 → choose one use case, define success, and set guardrails and escalation paths. • Week 2 → build the workflow, add source citations, and create a simple eval set. • Week 3 → pilot with 5-10 users, measure speed, quality, and failure modes. • Week 4 → harden, add alerts, and integrate into your main tools. ↳ Tip: If it takes more than 10 prompts to steady, the scope is too big. Do this and you transform a flashy demo into durable advantage. You’ll ship faster than rivals and learn immediately from real usage. That’s how you build moats in the new AI cycle. What’s stopping you from shipping one production multimodal workflow in the next 30 days?","source":"community_social_dev_to","source_type":"rss","url":"https://dev.to/aiwithapex/gemini-3-pro-how-googles-new-ai-reads-sees-and-codes-like-never-before-4f57","published_date":"2025-11-23T06:05:17","collected_date":"2025-11-23T06:47:08.996682","language":"en","tags":["trends","google","productivity","gemini","tutorials","developer","community","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"DEV

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_9430fad958f1","title":"If you’re not helping employees with AI","content":"In the modern working world, employees have a lot on their minds. From stressing about high costs of living and pressing political issues, there are no shortage of worries to go around. But worries at work are stacking up, too, with many feeling uncertain about their future employment in the face of AI. While workplaces are seeing some benefits to automating tasks with AI, there’s another not-so-secret problem with the technology taking off: employee anxiety. In part, that’s because workers are deeply stressed about being replaced, but there are also learning curves that come with working alongside the technology. Also notable, one recent study found that AI is making workers’ jobs harder in another way. It messes with managers’ expectations, meaning they end up giving employees more work that they expect completed in less time. Holding space for AI-xiety In the face of such significant change, some say that leaders have a new job to do: They need to hold space for all the anxiety around AI, or, AI-xiety, if you will. Heidi Brooks, a leadership expert and senior lecturer in organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management, tells Fast Company that because anxiety is now “a central part of the workplace experience,” leaders need to meet the moment. But it’s not necessarily about trying to calm or settle worries, and it’s definitely not about ignoring them altogether. Instead, it’s about being present. “Presence isn’t just about showing up—it’s about how you show up,” Brooks explains. “It’s the groundedness, the way you stay in touch with people in the midst of ambiguity or distress, without rushing to fix or smooth things over.” Brooks adds that while it may feel more comfortable to avoid the worries, “choosing to stay steady in the face of uncertainty is a quiet but powerful form of leadership.” Communication is key As concerns around AI are booming, at the same time issues like burnout are skyrocketing. It’s no secret that many employees are feeling unsettled. That means bosses need to do more than just say they’re there for workers. As Brooks puts it, “Presence is in the eyes of the beholder.” Therefore, employees have to feel that from you. “Communication, in this anxious context, becomes more than just information-sharing. It’s a form of containment,” Brooks says. “Silence can promote fear, and in the absence of communication, people can fill the gaps with worst-case scenarios.” Therefore, even if leaders aren’t necessarily sure themselves how to fix the issues employees are worried about, keeping communication open is, in itself, still an effective tool. Recent research supports the expert’s insight, too: A recent survey on frontline workers in the AI age found that while only 17% of said their organization is transparent about AI integration, 63% said communication about the technology is essential. “If you explain it, we’ll accept it,” one worker said. “If you don’t, we’ll resist.” Brooks says employers don’t need to have all the answers to be good communicators and to calm fears. “It’s not about false certainty,” she explains. “It’s about helping people feel less alone in the uncertainty, and perhaps even inviting them to be part of the learning process by inviting their voice.” Leaders need check-ins, too Undoubtedly, leaders are in a new era, too. They have big challenges ahead of them as they learn to work with automation. Brooks says leaders are also learning to “hold space for human experience . . . as we find our way forward” in the AI age. But not only do leaders have to worry about their teams—they also need to check in with themselves, especially around their own anxieties and struggles when it comes to new technology. “It’s a good time not only to be intentional about touching base with people on your teams, but for you to do the same for yourself,” Brooks says. Leaders, then, also need the space to air their own fears—in addition to being a sounding board for others. Brooks adds, “When we can be real about naming what we are going through, we are often wiser together, because we can discuss what’s happening and learn our way forward.”","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91447374/if-youre-not-helping-employees-with-ai-xiety-youre-not-leading","published_date":"2025-11-23T12:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-23T12:48:17.985223","language":"en","tags":["leadership","technology","business","innovation"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":690,"author":"Sarah Bregel","raw_content_length":5840,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.45,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4136,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["employees","you","worries","the modern working world","a lot","their minds","high costs","political issues","no shortage","work"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["work"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"employees":3.0,"you":2.0,"worries":2.0,"the modern working world":1.0,"a lot":1.0,"their minds":1.0,"high costs":1.0,"political issues":1.0,"no shortage":1.0,"work":1.0}},"age_hours":0.9857397227777778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":0.7,"hashes":{"content_md5":"5577b27cb72fcac27eefd26a239d5c21","title_md5":"15076c6e40ee09de0f59522c730edfb6","url_normalized":"8a250305f52f7d76cd1752747d44fd52","minhash_signature":["8531275","8255351","14366","11617828","498956","7901950","4626937","2181150","693538","4729967","3134393","10426164","163247","1166689","953500","4356152","1276063","304913","178409","2713066","1196901","88593","775608","2113985","16164381","244614","2615540","5225880","354593","8720670","522500","587492","5807442","582111","1053967","2422815","99371","5474159","1925772","6977948","1313197","3329444","34242237","1785966","5895257","2463753","449615","13623637","1132398","3467375","2447249","843096","4286247","214699","136855","1211599","7015836","5982858","2560827","1151625","4334793","1311296","6578137","2997998","7601","4770883","2940560","1563117","1210097","4625726","6267686","1755940","6967888","3985712","5183863","2595826","269839","2143585","12221818","7924717","301782","2330191","14899793","20005884","442394","2319043","7112617","2033222","5524105","7585973","7678043","2175767","5258540","436779","12786202","5388347","631649","479007","5316044","441339","243170","14172480","3331841","2469083","129586","3376316","1707315","2447857","6462857","44001","5003486","7086138","2086119","76161","756656","5843300","120732","1144143","1592955","2957551","1131087","4042643","133333","10284378","3829832","809487","9098556","994056"],"title_minhash":["157819211","56763205","70084861","37621478","57666577","150433075","187215553","336919537","9886961","64989825","47314662","134580903","352686216","122557037","16595777","94997652","42803213","6970931","97811991","26473353","22368985","187029212","17219353","121166889","48105128","100256390","7507083","6529113","117963717","580480671","217990641","247260793","105128040","53142663","14343807","37942977","138871504","445124377","44829569","101238272","257174174","53208101","555771237","96837610","12507014","378991911","99335677","145824326","65408292","127512989","83721835","87827841","22685869","11447530","215673311","10654555","119787828","12498030","155780493","25582962","265465469","241175644","85421676","9364271","16879475","142862802","28142056","15245672","131201606","4625726","6267686","31929260","165145218","226086838","15858453","83014494","120195218","126149939","237373466","37320350","29834913","31391128","36633920","17963576","15871323","390461174","201682019","59383392","270054110","8661640","145066577","119526518","331491758","82247572","406004587","84291554","263228494","79629961","595866774","179289044","185122831","183517970","210681795","44451757","157020072","333443472","46213269","128264039","85083767","58526234","107800688","76239223","93898343","84154886","80047406","216872558","926978","159246978","223549883","20025063","123020346","54472211","256856753","68090062","70385328","165809109","23394572","27010433"],"combined_hash":"eca83b0dca19c54fdcc0fd38eaedb713"},"sentiment_score":0.6755,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8649,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.0175,"joy":0.0013,"surprise":0.0039,"sadness":0.0051,"fear":0.9669,"anger":0.0023,"disgust":0.0029},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"practitioner_account","workflow_detail":{"score":7.0,"evidence":"The article describes using Github Copilot to generate code for a specific task (creating a snake game).

{"id":"spanish_xataka_c826e84871c2","title":"Si la pregunta es c√≥mo mantener unido un imperio, los antiguos Wari lo ten√≠an claro: con cerveza psicod√©lica","content":"Los arque√≥logos han dado con una clave para entender mejor a los Wari, una civilizaci√≥n preincaica que floreci√≥ entre los siglos VI y XI d.C. y se expandi√≥ por gran parte de lo que hoy es Per√∫ y zonas de Argentina y Chile. Lo m√°s curioso es que los hallazgos no nos hablan de su arquitectura, pr√°cticas militares, estructura social o econom√≠a, sino de algo en apariencia mucho m√°s sencillo pero crucial para la prosperidad del imperio: la afici√≥n de sus jefes por la cerveza psicod√©lica. ¬øCerveza psicod√©lica? Exacto. El concepto no es nuevo. Sabemos que hace miles de a√±os los egipcios ya elaboraban c√≥cteles con vino y alucin√≥genos (entre otros ingredientes) y tampoco es desconocida la afici√≥n de las culturas preincaicas por las plantas psicoactivas o el uso de sustancias psicotr√≥picas en las sociedades precolombinas mesoamericanas. Lo curioso de los Wari no es tanto qu√© drogas consum√≠an como qui√©nes lo hac√≠an y (sobre todo) para qu√©. Su uso no estar√≠a limitado a sacerdotes en rituales, sino que se emplear√≠a con fines pol√≠ticos. \"Vemos este tipo de uso de alucin√≥genos como un contexto diferente al de las civilizaciones anteriores, que parecen haber reservado celosamente el empleo de alucin√≥genos para unos pocos elegidos, o el √∫ltimo Imperio Inca que enfatizaba el consumo masivo de cerveza pero no usaba sustancias psicotr√≥picas como la vilca\", explica el profesor Matthew Biwer, quien en 2022 ya public√≥ junto a otros colegas un estudio sobre el tema bas√°ndose en excavaciones en Quilcapampa (Per√∫). En Xataka Hemos encontrado 76 megatrampas en los Andes. Es incre√≠ble que no lo hubi√©semos hecho antes ¬øQu√© consum√≠an? Una mezcla de chicha y vilca. Para ser m√°s precisos una bebida alcoh√≥lica elaborada a partir de las bayas de la planta Schinus molle y un psicod√©lico llamado Anadenanthera colubrina. Los arque√≥logos tienen constancia desde hace tiempo de que el consumo de esta √∫ltima sustancia (vilca) se remonta a hace al menos 4.000 a√±os, sobre todo mediante pipas o inhalada como el rape. As√≠ lo sugieren restos localizados en la Cueva Inca, un yacimiento argentino. En el yacimiento Wari de Quilcapampa los arque√≥logos han encontrado sin embargo semillas de vilca cerca de restos de chicha elaborada con Schinus molle, lo que les lleva a pensar que los Wari no solo la consum√≠an con ayuda de pipas, sino que se la mezclaban con chicha para beb√©rsela en c√≥cteles psicod√©licos. ¬øPor qu√© es importante? Entre otras cuestiones, esos brebajes serv√≠an a los l√≠deres Wari para mostrar su poder. Al ofrecerle la mezcla a sus invitados no solo hac√≠an gala de su hospitalidad, tambi√©n ofrec√≠an un lujo que no estaba al alcance de cualquiera. Los arque√≥logos localizaron restos de vilca en Quilcampampa, pero en realidad la planta crece a cientos de kil√≥metros de all√≠, en Ayacucho y Cusco. \"Los Wari a√±ad√≠an la vilca a la chicha para impresionar a los invitados en sus festines, quienes no pod√≠an repetir la experiencia. Esto cre√≥ una relaci√≥n de deuda entre los Wari y sus invitados, probablemente de la regi√≥n circundante\", se√±alaba el profesor Matthew Biwer hace a√±os, cuando public√≥ su primera investigaci√≥n. ¬øServ√≠a para algo m√°s? S√≠. Y eso es lo realmente interesante de un nuevo estudio publicado por Jacob Keer y Justin Jennings en Revista de Arqueolog√≠a Americana, donde inciden en otra funci√≥n del brebaje psicod√©lico a base de chicha y vilca. Seg√∫n sus an√°lisis, el c√≥ctel ayudaba a los mandatarios Wari a consolidar su poder. ¬øC√≥mo? Organizando celebraciones comunales en las que se ofrec√≠a la bebida, festines de confraternizaci√≥n que se celebraban en patios casi cerrados. \"Salvo por un peque√±o trozo de cielo, estaban aislados del resto del mundo en un espacio interior de altos muros\", relatan los investigadores en su art√≠culo. \"Este era el lugar donde pasaban horas juntos, bebiendo, comiendo, conversando y rezando. Las horas que los participantes pasaban juntos deben haber representado una experiencia colectiva inolvidable que forj√≥ fuertes lazos entre los asistentes\". ¬øPara qu√© les serv√≠a? Para estrechar lazos. Esos festines serv√≠an a los l√≠deres Wari para forzar alianzas y consolidar su poder. Y no solo por la puesta en escena. Los investigadores han estudiado los efectos que pudo tener entre los asistentes el brebaje psicod√©lico, aumentando su empat√≠a, facilitando la creaci√≥n de lazos a largo plazo y limando las asperezas en un imperio en expansi√≥n. \"Aunque los arque√≥logos prestan cada vez m√°s atenci√≥n al papel de los psicod√©licos en las sociedades del pasado dedican poco tiempo a sus efectos psicol√≥gicos a largo plazo. Uno de estos efectos es la neuroplasticidad, que puede provocar sentimientos prosociales duraderos\", se√±ala el estudio, que resalta que el \"resplandor\" tras el consumo de la vilca (un efecto que se prolongaba durante d√≠as) pudo ayudar a unificar a las comunidades, \"desempe√±ando un papel fundamental en el gobierno Wari\". La combinaci√≥n de la vilca y la cerveza ayudar√≠a de hecho a disminuir en parte los efectos psicod√©licos, pero prolong√°ndolos en el tiempo. ¬øEst√°n todos de acuerdo? Los investigadores sugieren que las personas que consum√≠an el c√≥ctel psicod√©lico mostraban una \"mayor apertura y empat√≠a\", una actitud ventajosa en un imperio en el que conviv√≠an \"personas que hab√≠an sido extra√±as o incluso enemigas\". No todos lo ven sin embargo igual de claro. Live Science entrevist√≥ hace poco a varios expertos, ajenos al estudio, que no ocultan su escepticismo. Entre otras razones porque no ven lo suficientemente demostrado que los Wari mezclasen vilca y cerveza. Cierto que se encontraron restos cerca y no hab√≠a rastro de pipas ni ning√∫n otro indicio de que la vilca se consumiese de la forma tradicional, pero echan en falta una prueba aplastante, como fragmentos de cer√°micas que conserven ambos compuestos.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_5495ebee3bf7","title":"La IA nos est√° convirtiendo en editores de nosotros mismos. Aprobamos lo que ya no sabemos crear","content":"Hace un tiempo Spark, mi cliente de correo, integr√≥ un generador de respuestas por IA que aprende de tu estilo. Funciona sorprendentemente bien. Desde entonces sigo una regla simple: si el correo viene de un humano, respondo tecleando. Si viene de un bot o de un env√≠o masivo, dejo que la IA responda por m√≠. El caso es que cada vez es m√°s dif√≠cil distinguir cu√°l es cu√°l. Y ah√≠ es donde empieza el problema real. Porque no se trata de eficiencia. Se trata de que hemos aceptado, sin darnos cuenta, que la comunicaci√≥n puede ser sim√©trica en su mediocridad. T√∫ me escribes con IA, yo te respondo con IA. Todos ahorramos tiempo. Nadie dice nada del todo real. Conozco a demasiada gente que ha cruzado la siguiente l√≠nea: usar la IA no solo para correos gen√©ricos, sino para todo: Tuits que suenan a manual corporativo.Posts de LinkedIn con esa prosa untuosa y forzosamente inspiracional que huele a prompt vaguete desde tres p√°rrafos de distancia.Propuestas a clientes.Informes al jefe.Mensajes de Slack que antes escrib√≠as en segundos y ahora pasas por ChatGPT.Se han convertido en editores de su propia comunicaci√≥n. Directores creativos de palabras que ya no buscan ellos. Y en cierta forma funciona, hay que admitirlo. El informe llega a tiempo. La propuesta suena profesional. El tuit, por razones que desconozco, consigue engagement. Si el resultado es lo que cuenta, y encima te ahorra tiempo, ¬øcu√°l es el problema? El problema es sutil. Tan sutil que casi nadie lo nota. En Xataka Hay una generaci√≥n trabajando gratis como documentalista de su propia vida: no son influencers pero act√∫an como si lo fueran Escribir nunca fue solo producir texto legible. Era la fricci√≥n de buscar la palabra exacta, y en esa b√∫squeda entender mejor lo que quer√≠as decir. La escritura era pensamiento haci√©ndose visible, incluso para uno mismo. El esfuerzo de articular era el esfuerzo de pensar con claridad. Recuerdo algunos art√≠culos en los que not√© ese esfuerzo hasta llegar al resultado que quer√≠a. Un ejemplo es este de 2019, mucho antes de ChatGPT. Ese proceso importa. Ahora delegamos esa fricci√≥n. Le damos a la IA una idea vaga y ella la articula por nosotros. Solo necesitamos reconocer si suena bien, no generarlo desde cero. Hemos pasado de ser autores a ser aprobadores. Algo se atrofia cuando dejas de buscar tus propias palabras. No es solo personalidad o estilo. Es la capacidad de pensar con precisi√≥n, porque pensar bien y escribir bien siempre fueron la misma cosa. Cuando externalizas la articulaci√≥n, externalizas el pensamiento. Lo peor es que es invisible. No hay momento dram√°tico en el que dejes de saber pensar. Solo empiezas a necesitar un poco m√°s de ayuda cada vez. Un peque√±o empuj√≥n para encontrar las palabras. Luego un borrador completo que solo \"revisas\". Luego ni siquiera revisas con cuidado porque \"la IA lo hace guay\". El argumento siempre es el mismo: \"pero si el resultado es bueno\". Y s√≠, puede que lo sea. El informe se entiende. La propuesta convence. El tuit funciona. Pero hay una diferencia entre un texto que funciona y un texto que pensaste de verdad. La primera puede conseguirte un cliente. La segunda puede hacerte entender algo que no sab√≠as que pensabas. As√≠ es como una generaci√≥n entera puede perder la capacidad de articular ideas complejas sin darse cuenta. Porque cada paso individual parece razonable. Cada atajo parece inofensivo. Y los resultados, en efecto, son aceptables. Pero \"aceptable\" se ha convertido en el nuevo est√°ndar. Y en el proceso hemos olvidado que la escritura no era solo un medio para comunicar ideas que ya ten√≠amos claras. Era el mecanismo mismo para tenerlas claras. La IA no nos est√° volviendo peores escritores. Nos est√° convirtiendo en no-escritores. Y sin escritura, sin esa lucha por encontrar las palabras justas, perdemos tambi√©n la capacidad de tener ideas que valga la pena escribir. Hemos normalizado una existencia donde supervisamos nuestra propia comunicaci√≥n en lugar de generarla. Donde aprobamos en lugar de crear. Donde el lenguaje es algo que reconocemos cuando lo vemos, pero que ya no sabremos producir desde el silencio. Y lo llamamos productividad.

{"id":"spanish_xataka_f892dd101d66","title":"Las calzadas romanas cambiaron el mundo. Y este Google Maps de hace 2.000 a√±os te permite recorrerlas","content":"¬øQu√© nos han dado los romanos? No es una pregunta que me haga cuando no puedo dormir, sino la genial s√°tira que los Monty Python plasmaron en ‚ÄòLa vida de Brian‚Äô. El acueducto, el alcantarillado, la ense√±anza, la irrigaci√≥n, la sanidad, el vino, los ba√±os p√∫blicos‚Ä¶ y las carreteras. En su punto de m√°ximo esplendor, se estima que la red del imperio se expand√≠a a lo largo de 120.000 kil√≥metros, pero a medida que se ha ido excavando se han hallado m√°s y m√°s restos de calzadas romanas. En algunas ocasiones hemos tra√≠do alg√∫n ‚ÄúGoogle Maps‚Äù del Imperio Romano, pero lo que hoy tenemos entre manos es la culminaci√≥n de un trabajo antol√≥gico que recopila algunas de las fuentes m√°s importantes de las arterias del imperio y plasma esas carreteras es un imponente mapa interactivo con casi 300.000 kil√≥metros de carreteras. La herramienta se llama itiner-e, y es algo que puede absorbernos durante horas y horas. El Google Maps del Imperio RomanoSi ya has dado una vuelta por el mapa, debes saber que se trata de un elemento vivo. A medida que se vayan realizando descubrimientos y precisando la ubicaci√≥n de las v√≠as, el equipo actualizar√° el mapa. Pero lo que tenemos actualmente es el resultado de m√°s de cinco a√±os de trabajo realizado por un equipo con miembros tanto de la Universidad Aut√≥noma de Barcelona como de la Universidad de Aarhus de Dinamarca. En el estudio publicado en Nature, detallan que es ‚Äúel conjunto de datos digitales m√°s detallado y completo de carreteras de todo el Imperio Romano‚Äù publicado hasta ahora. De hecho, supera por m√°s de 100.000 km la longitud conocida de las carreteras romanas gracias tanto a una mayor cobertura en el foco como a una mejor precisi√≥n espacial. Anteriormente, el Atlas Digital de Civilizaciones Romana y Medievales (DARMC) cartografi√≥ 188.554,7 kil√≥metros. Para ello, los investigadores identificaron tanto las v√≠as m√°s importantes como los caminos de fuentes arqueol√≥gicas e hist√≥ricas, localiz√°ndolas utilizando mapas topogr√°ficos tanto hist√≥ricos como actuales. En Xataka Los romanos crearon una civilizaci√≥n milenaria y maravillas de la ingenier√≠a, pero fracasaron en algo simple: que Roma oliera bien Las principales fuentes han sido el Itinerario Antonino y la Tabula Peutingeriana, pero los ‚Äúhitos‚Äù y asentamientos cercanos entre s√≠ (por ejemplo, l√≠mites del imperio, como los cercanos al Muro de Adriano) son los que han permitido a los investigadores asumir la existencia de caminos que los conectaban. Otras fuentes incluyen res√∫menes de la red de carreteras romanas en regiones espec√≠ficas, mapas del Mapping Past Societies, el Atlas Barrington o la Tabula Imperii Romani, entre muchos otros. Fruto de este trabajo, el nuevo mapa incluye 299.171 kil√≥metros de carreteras (para conectar un territorio de m√°s de cuatro millones de kil√≥metros cuadrados), y se dividen de la siguiente forma: 103.478 kil√≥metros de carreteras principales, un 34,6% del total.195.693 kil√≥metros de v√≠as secundarias, un 65,4% del total. Y no es que se hayan sacado m√°s de 100.000 kil√≥metros de la manga, sino que carreteras que antes atravesaban r√≠os o eran simples l√≠neas rectas, ahora se han trazado con mayor precisi√≥n, adapt√°ndose a las peculiaridades topogr√°ficas del terreno. Ahora bien, aunque el trabajo es asombroso y podemos apreciar jugueteando con las distintas capas de informaci√≥n que muchas de las v√≠as principales coinciden con carreteras actuales, los investigadores confiesan que ‚Äús√≥lo‚Äù se conoce con certeza la ubicaci√≥n del 2,737% de las v√≠as romanas. Es por eso que la gran mayor√≠a de carreteras de itiner-e muestran la leyenda de ‚Äúhipot√©tico‚Äù o ‚Äúconjetura‚Äù, justo antes de detallar el registro del que tomaron los datos. Esta certeza depende de: Certeza: segmentos bien documentados en las fuentes, que han sido digitalizados con alta precisi√≥n espacial.Conjetura: segmentos con menor precisi√≥n espacial debido a un menor nivel de documentaci√≥n.Hipot√©tico: caminos que se especula que existieron, pero de los que no hay evidencia suficiente como para clasificarlos dentro de uno de los grupos anteriores. Por ejemplo, carreteras en zonas des√©rticas en los que la infraestructura era menos fija y donde se han encontrado varias v√≠as paralelas. En Xataka La mejor forma de sumergirte de nuevo en la Segunda Guerra Mundial: un \"Google Maps\" interactivo del conflicto Pero m√°s all√° de saciar nuestra curiosidad, algo que podemos hacer con este mapa es‚Ä¶ jugar. El equipo ha incluido una funci√≥n que a√∫n est√° en estado de beta y permite explorar el tiempo que tomaban estas rutas. Para ello, tenemos que seleccionar entre varios puntos y seleccionar entre cuatro modos de transporte terrestre: A pie a una velocidad de 4 km/h.En carro de bueyes a 2 km/2.En un animal como un burro a 4,5 km/h.Y a caballo a 6 km/h. Tambi√©n podemos seleccionar rutas mar√≠timas con velocidades de 2,5 km/h r√≠o abajo y 0,6 km/h r√≠o arriba. Al final, aquel grupo rebelde de ‚ÄòLa vida de Brian‚Äô ten√≠a bastante raz√≥n a la hora de decir que una de las cosas m√°s importantes que los romanos hab√≠an hecho por ellos hab√≠a sido el despliegue de calzadas. Porque fueron fundamentales para agilizar el transporte dentro de los dominios del imperio, y aquel trabajo se nota, incluso, a d√≠a de hoy. Fueron los cimientos sobre los que construimos nuestras carreteras y n√∫cleos urbanos. Es algo que queda patente cuando observamos que el √∫nico lugar del imperio en el que no hubo un despliegue tan importante o meticuloso, como √Åfrica y Medio Oriente, donde el comercio sobre ruedas se abandon√≥ al apostar por las caravanas de camellos en los siglos IV-VI, tiene consecuencias a d√≠a de hoy.
