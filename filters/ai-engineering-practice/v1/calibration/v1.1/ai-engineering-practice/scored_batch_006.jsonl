{"id":"positive_news_cultural_survival_9ffd56c6ed66","title":"Karamoja's Path to Peace: From Cattle Raids to Regenerative Agriculture in Uganda","content":"Karamoja's Path to Peace: From Cattle Raids to Regenerative Agriculture in Uganda Country Uganda agnes Fri, 11/21/2025 - 08:01 Issues Human Rights Program 5 Main Image By Francesco Torri “We were raised as warriors. It’s part of our culture, but there has been too much bloodshed. Now, we fight for peace,” says Simonpeter, a young ex-combatant from the Jie ethnic group, known as Karachuna in the local language. It’s a cloudy, late afternoon in the semi-arid savannah of Kotido district in Karamoja, Uganda, where 10 young ex-warriors are finishing collecting an abundant harvest of sorghum. Simonpeter, the oldest member, explains that two years ago at this time, they would be hidden in the bush with arrows and Kalashnikovs, preparing for a raid. They are excited when talking about it, and they laugh when one of them starts moving as if he were in the bush. “As the number of guns rose again in 2019, [gunfire] exchange became more frequent among raiders and the risk of dying during cattle raids got increasingly higher,” says Jhon, Project Assistant at the local organization Justice and Peace Department of Kotido. “And even if in Karimojong culture losing [one’s] life during a raid is considered an honor, the desire for peace quickly [replaced] this traditional idea as the escalation of violence became unbearable.” Karachunas simulating a raid. For almost five years, until the end of 2024, cattle raiding surged in the region, interrupting a period of relative peace that had lasted 13 years, but during which the real drivers of cattle raiding were left unaddressed. “Karimojongs are cattle raiders by tradition. It’s a practice embedded in culture, a ritual, something we identify with and that we are proud of,” explains Gabriel, an ex-Karachuna from the village of Loletio, near Kotido. “Raids have always been a way to gain social respect, and the only way to pay for a marriage for many of us,” he says. Since the fall of Amin’s regime in 1979, the number of guns in the region grew exponentially as the armories of Kotido and Moroto were plundered by Karimojong warriors, who stole more than 10,000 rifles, including Kalashnikovs. This episode transformed cattle raiding into violent, inter-Tribal warfare and led to extreme insecurity levels in Karamoja that lasted for decades. Until the early 2000s, the government paid limited attention to the security situation in Karamoja, tackling it with heavy-handed approaches that were marred by rampant human rights violations. Such marginalization and institutional neglect exacerbated the conditions of extreme poverty and malnutrition already present in the region. Then, in 2006, the first voluntary disarmament campaign was started by President Museveni, who gave amnesty to all warriors who voluntarily returned their weapons. “In this way, thousands of guns were removed from the region, and this led to a significant reduction in the number and intensity of conflicts in Karamoja,” explains Charles Ichogor, Resident District Commissioner of Kotido.

However, the government failed to provide alternative means of subsistence for the newly disarmed men, nor socioeconomic reintegration programs or climate change adaptation strategies, and the levels of poverty and food insecurity worsened exponentially. The root causes of cattle raiding remained unaddressed for years, and in late 2018, violence progressively resurfaced. Conditions were further worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, when the lack of access to basic subsistence led to skyrocketing levels of economic insecurity, and raids became increasingly more frequent. Cattle raiding came back as the main source of livelihood for most communities, and the leading source of poverty and death for many others. As reported in a 2022 article in The New Humanitarian, more than 500 people have died since 2019 due to cattle raiding. During this era, the Uganda People Defence Forces implemented Operation Usalama Kwa Wote, which included a new strategy to address raiding using paid informants within the community. The social fabric of Karimojong communities quickly eroded as raiders started targeting and killing those who were suspected of being informants. Along with its informant-based campaign, the government continued implementing a shoot-at-first-sight policy against suspected raiders. In June 2023, the UPDF transitioned to a new strategy based on voluntary disarmament, facilitated by the presidential amnesty granted to the raiders. This allowed non-governmental actors to get involved, offering alternative livelihoods to ex-combatants. Karamojong villages seen from above. The Justice and Peace Department of the Catholic Diocese of Kotido (JPD-K) has been leading the way in supporting disarmament since then, fostering inter- and intracommunal dialogues to build lasting peace agreements and creating socio-economic and psychosocial reintegration programs for ex-Karachunas. Nicola Carradori, Coordinator of JPD-K, says they facilitate weekly dialogues and mediation sessions among Jie, Dodoth, Turkana, and Acholi communities, and practical field training. “Peace is built by bringing about a change of mindset among Karachunas: from warriors to members of a peaceful community. To be part of a community disarmament alone isn’t enough. Karachunas need another way to sustain themselves; otherwise they would just go back to raiding,” she says. To achieve such reintegration, the JPD-K is supporting over 650 ex-combatants to access sustainable income-generating activities like regenerative agriculture, agroforestry, and beekeeping, agro-pastoral field schools, distribution of tools and seeds, literacy classes, and dialogue processes. Participants who show commitment and work as a group continue receiving support. “We are supporting a process of change aimed at creating real and stable alternatives for young Karamojong,” says Nuria Teko, vice chairperson of the District of Kotido. Elder talking at a peace dialogue near Kotido. Agriculture in Karamoja has historically never moved beyond basic subsistence and has always faced major challenges. The lack of adequate tools and harsh climatic conditions has kept local communities from turning farming into a real source of income. Karamoja is an extremely arid region with very low annual rainfall. During the rainy season, fields are at high risk of flooding, while water collection options remain limited. For this reason, the Karimojong have evolved to be semi-nomadic shepherds; pastoralism is the way of life best suited to the semi-arid islands of the Karamoja. “To farm here, you need skills and equipment that simply didn’t exist before the JPD-K demobilization and reintegration program,” Ichogor says. Today, thanks to drought-resilient practices, micro-scale irrigation, and the distribution of seeds that are more suitable for the local climate, Karachunas are managing to commercialize agricultural products. “Some of these groups have already collected between 25 and 40 bags of sorghum this year, which can yield, once sold, between 5 and 10 million Ugandan shillings, so more than 2,000 Euros,” says Peter Lopuko, Project Officer of JPD-K. A tractor purchased in May by JPD-K additionally allowed 23 communities of former combatants—thousands of people—to cultivate their sorghum fields, the region’s main crop. “Peace is still fragile in the region and efforts need to continue if we want to prevent insecurity levels from rising again,” says Gabriel, an ex-Karachuna who is now part of the JPD-K reintegration program. “But change is visible,” he continues. “Groups that once shot at each other now sit in the same circle. Ex-raiders speak on local radio, encouraging others to lay down arms. And community fields are being restored in areas long affected by violence.” --Francesco Torri is a freelance environmental journalist, photographer, and video-maker from Italy.

{"id":"positive_news_upworthy_81ff9fc3aad6","title":"Economics expert pinpoints the exact moment in 2012 when 'America went to hell'","content":"America has never been a perfect place, but since the Civil War, it has been one where most people bought into the idea of the country and supported the institutions that keep it running. People may disagree on politics and culture, but when America was threatened, whether it was 9/11 or World War II, people came together to fight for the country they love, even though the reasons may have differed.However, it’d be naive to say that sentiment is still as strong as it once was. Since The Great Recession, many people have felt that the vibes are off in America, and polls and research back those feelings. Right around 2012, when smartphones became ubiquitous, there was a considerable rise in the number of people who felt that America was on the wrong track and that racism and sexism were considerably worse than they were just a year before. There was also a big spike in mental illness.So what happened in 2012? Did the world suddenly become drastically worse overnight, or had our perceptions been changed? Man checks his smartphone for news. Canva PhotosWhy does it feel like America is on the decline?Other developed countries have experienced similar vibe shifts since 2012, but it has hit America the hardest. Economics blogger Noah Smith explains why this feeling of malaise has hit America so hard, and he illustrates it perfectly in a viral Substack piece called “Social media destroyed one of America's key advantages.” Smith is an American blogger and commentator on economics and current events and former assistant Professor of Behavioral Finance at Stony Brook University.In his Substack post, Smith postulates that the technological change hit America the hardest because it punctured our geographical buffers. “A hippie in Oakland and a redneck in the suburbs of Houston both fundamentally felt that they were part of the same unified nation; that nation looked very different to people in each place,” Smith writes. “Californians thought America was California, and Texans thought America was Texas, and this generally allowed America to function.” — (@) Why did America fundamentally change in 2012?Here’s an excerpt from Smith’s piece. Please check out the entire piece on the Noahpinion Substack.Like some kind of forcible hive mind out of science fiction, social media suddenly threw every American in one small room with every other American. Decades of hard work spent running away from each other and creating our ideologically fragmented patchwork of geographies went up in smoke overnight, as geography suddenly ceased to mediate the everyday discussion of politics and culture.The sudden collapse of geographic sorting in political discussion threw all Americans in the same room with each other — and like the characters in Sartre’s No Exit, they discovered that “Hell is other people.” Conservatives suddenly discovered that a lot of Americans despise Christianity or resent White people over the legacy of discrimination. Liberals suddenly remembered that a lot of their countrymen frown on their lifestyles. Every progressive college kid got to see every piece of right-wing fake news that their grandparents were sharing on Facebook (whereas before, these would have been quietly confined to chain emails). Every conservative in a small town got to see Twitter activists denouncing White people. And so on. A group of people protesting in the street. via Ted Eytan/Flickr It sounds cynical to believe that America was a better place when people were less likely to talk to people with a different worldview, but it may be true. Given how things have gone in the past 15 years, it’s fair to say that putting every American in a proverbial ring to fight it out just makes everyone feel under attack...and the fight never ends.The problem with the Like buttonAnother development around the same time that many believe negatively affected the country was the development of the Like button on Facebook. The button made its debut in 2009, and it, along with the share button, which came in 2010, incentivized people to create content that their audience agreed with—creating echo chambers. The buttons also incentivized people to make outrage-provoking posts and create fake stories to go viral and increase advertising revenue. Like button.Canva PhotosThe positive takeaway from Smith’s geographical sorting theory is that, quite possibly, many people’s perceptions about life in America are wrong because we’re seeing it through the distorted, funhouse mirror of social media that shows us every bad deed in a country of 330 million people and amplifies the voices of the unscrupulous. By pinpointing the moment that America “went to hell,” as author Jonathan Haidt says in an X post, we also have a roadmap to get back to when people had greater faith in America’s institutions and people.This article originally appeared in June.","source":"positive_news_upworthy","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.upworthy.com/americas-2012-vibe-shift-ex1","published_date":"2025-11-21T15:39:53","collected_date":"2025-11-21T18:36:52.198306","language":"en","tags":["change","great_recession","politics","impact","2012","noah_smith","opinion","mental_health","smartphones","americans"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Upworthy","source_category":"positive_news","word_count":786,"author":"Tod Perry","raw_content_length":10291,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.93,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["America"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4868,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["America","Economics expert","the exact moment","hell","the country","a perfect place","the Civil War","most people","the idea","the institutions"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"America":4.0,"Economics expert":2.0,"the exact moment":2.0,"hell":2.0,"the country":2.0,"a perfect place":1.0,"the Civil War":1.0,"most people":1.0,"the idea":1.0,"the institutions":1.0}},"age_hours":3.074807334444445,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"9f0177bedef11e4cd0eb17bbd2e3ee49","title_md5":"da939d22a99feb424e66b930233155d6","url_normalized":"40b22d033b8811bdf12b3b6b59558482","minhash_signature":["1222661","6696742","14366","8933470","498956","2445631","4380964","2181150","2753670","4729967","3134393","3646982","2343024","1166689","953500","5696696","2138553","304913","497505","113500","1196901","88593","459618","2113985","6579678","1882961","4073761","3612616","8420710","1456173","2169913","587492","4511764","582111","1053967","880599","99371","5474159","309467","5331115","2394106","792666","4646890","1579992","10502397","2720336","1691750","4687665","1132398","10675237","2447249","843096","4286247","7574389","136855","1914246","2780349","6045037","3516270","1151625","3391834","1311296","1936","4886012","7601","3789593","10575424","1563117","1210097","4625726","4258427","877954","4090701","4528274","758867","2595826","269839","3699366","5530344","2767004","1246369","1544236","14899793","17474505","442394","2319043","698108","2033222","1442738","7585973","504781","2175767","8261531","1768946","1078334","1881726","1608076","479007","5316044","5834464","583082","9667526","3331841","7495224","922983","3376316","1030147","2447857","6834888","44001","1243296","7086138","1550051","3964217","664238","1943155","120732","1307835","1592955","2957551","1131087","4372651","133333","7407467","10498655","809487","1742731","33668"],"title_minhash":["23332185","42841784","4229889","36752328","14887823","19580689","250647858","42886009","48727153","35828643","13856619","59482527","71325486","81527491","45071372","18133293","42803213","146280124","9722371","12273043","31716184","82022587","38982201","104526761","43748384","15228077","85584512","44662604","39594623","19810598","3290860","16000752","69000771","34245098","37667665","9484100","51437858","51856862","138301654","11762562","13843582","64076877","115753605","1785966","10502397","36428735","72594150","45889349","11618208","57965815","129139028","3526907","85337191","123510148","136855","13331872","36516285","7750562","4656097","1151625","115403208","20642647","892430","79785124","99834656","64723997","21803903","72279048","38628343","22387322","5786666","16057215","15660456","3689470","45957776","3487483","1140460","31330255","80381280","46198111","7874076","97320033","74880945","163493226","134380567","40851985","218612806","24741608","42058725","57602050","74938439","100058244","55993373","18836545","122834698","19798619","155682973","43573138","334183233","5834464","24606857","66992058","7438165","109018535","23272788","62429428","44648848","17178449","13734988","12196566","17312157","54029681","18186855","20727193","46737091","15174305","13266078","1702754","1592955","25820802","76404216","54472211","98574423","68090062","11960637","36851654","29393718","31267308"],"combined_hash":"bfb288fd9b2f18e1a2c0228b2231fb69"},"sentiment_score":0.17600000000000005,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9648,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.145,"joy":0.0065,"surprise":0.0047,"sadness":0.0095,"fear":0.7834,"anger":0.0406,"disgust":0.0103},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"practitioner_account","workflow_detail":{"score":7.0,"evidence":"The author describes using ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code for a React component, then modifying it to fit their needs.

{"id":"positive_news_upworthy_93e88e95d14b","title":"A factual Google search about Maria Von Trapp shows why its 'AI overview' can't be trusted","content":"When Google launched its \"AI Overview\" in the spring of 2024 with messaging like \"Generative AI in Search: Let Google do the searching for you\" and \"Find what you're looking for faster and easier with AI overviews in search results,\" it seemed quite promising. Instead of having to filter through pages of search results yourself, the expectation was that AI would parse through the relevant results for you and synopsize the answer to whatever question you asked.That sounded like a great time and energy saver. But unfortunately, artificial intelligence isn't actually intelligent, and the AI overview synopsis is too often entirely wrong. We're not talking just a little misleading or inaccurate, but blatantly, factually false. Let me show you an example.I was writing an article about the real-life love story between Maria and Georg Von Trapp, and as part of my research, I found out Georg died 20 years after they got married. I hadn't come across anything about Maria remarrying after Georg's death, so I Googled whether she had. Here's what the AI Overview said when I searched: This math wasn't mathing. Screenshot via Google \"Maria Von Trapp married twice. First, she married Georg Von Trapp in 1927 and they had 10 children together. After Georg's death, she married Hugh David Campbell in 1954 and had 7 daughters with him. Later, she also married Lynne Peterson in 1969 and had one son and daughter with him.\"Something about that answer didn't add up—and it wasn't just that she'd supposedly married twice but had three spouses. Maria Von Trapp was born in 1905, so according to this AI Overview, she'd remarried at 49 years old and then had seven more children, and then married again at 64 years old and had another two children. So she had 19 children in total? And she had nine of them in her 50s and 60s? That seemed…unlikely.I clicked the source link on the AI Overview, which took me to the Maria Von Trapp Wikipedia page. On that page, I found a chart where the extra two spouses' names were listed—but they very clearly weren't her spouses. Hugh David Campbell was the husband of one of Maria's daughters. And Lynne Peterson was the wife of one of her sons.The truth is that Maria never remarried after Georg died. If I had believed the AI Overview, I would have gotten it this very basic fact about her life completely wrong. And it's not like the overview pulled that information from a source that got it wrong. Wikipedia had it right. The AI Overview itself extrapolated the information incorrectly.But the funniest part of all of this is that when I repeated the Google search \"Did Maria Von Trapp remarry after Georg died?\" while writing this article to see if the same result came back, the AI Overview got it right, citing the very Upworthy article I had written. The AI Overview cited my own article while giving the correct answer. Screenshot via Google This may seem like a lot of fuss over something inconsequential in the big picture, but Maria Von Trapp's marital status is not the only wrong result I've seen in Google's AI Overview. I once searched for the cast of a specific movie and the AI Overview included a famous actor's name that I knew for 100% certain was not in the film. I've asked it for quotes about certain subjects and found quotes that were completely made up.Are these world-changing questions? No. Does that matter? No. What matters are facts and people assuming the Google overview is correct when it might be egregiously wrong. Facts matter. Giphy Objective facts are objective facts. If the AI Overview so egregiously messes up the facts about something that's easily verifiable, how can it be relied on for anything else? Since its launch, Google has had to fix major errors, like when it responded to the query \"How many Muslim presidents has the U.S. had?\" with the very wrong answer that Barack Obama had been our first Muslim president. As of November of 2025, it's calling the latest \"Call of Duty\" iteration a fake game, when it's very much real. Some people have \"tricked\" Google's AI into giving ridiculous answers by simply asking it ridiculous questions, like \"How many rocks should I eat?\" but that's a much smaller part of the problem. Most of us have come to rely on basic, normal, run-of-the-mill searches on Google for all kinds of information. Google is, by far, the most used search engine, with 79% of the search engine market share worldwide as of March 2025. The most relied upon search tool should have reliable search results, don't you think?Even the Google AI Overview itself says it's not reliable: Even Google's AI Overview says Google's AI Overview can't be trusted. Screenshot via Google As much as I appreciate how useful Google's search engine has been over the years, launching an AI feature that sometimes makes things up and puts them them at the top of people's search results feels incredibly irresponsible. And the fact that it still spits out completely (yet unpredictably) false results about objectively factual information over a year after its launch is unforgivable, in my opinion.We're living in an era where people are divided not only by political ideologies but by our very perceptions of reality. Misinformation has been weaponized more and more over the past decade, and as a result, we often can't even agree on the basic facts much less complex ideas. As the public's trust in expertise, institutions, legacy media, and fact-checking has dwindled, people have turned to alternative sources to get information. Unfortunately, those sources come with varying levels of bias and reliability, and our society and democracy are suffering because of it. Having Google spitting out false search results at random is not helpful on that front. At all. - YouTube www.youtube.com AI has its place, but this isn't it. My fear is that far too many people assume the AI Overview is correct without double-checking its sources. And if people have to double-check it anyway, the thing is of no real use—just have Google give links to the sources like they used to and end this bizarre experiment with technology that simply isn't ready for its intended use.This article originally appeared in

{"id":"ai_engadget_f60f89df7115","title":"In a rare deal, my favorite gaming headset is 28 percent off for Black Friday","content":"The truth is, most gaming headsets aren’t great values. I’ve tested a ton of them for our buying guide, and while the space has improved over time, it remains far too centered on branding and marketing. Too much of what passes by my desk comes off as overpriced compared to a good set of “normal” headphones in the same range, both in audio and build quality. If you have a pair you love, more power to you. But generally speaking, these things tax you for the perception of being specialized for gaming. In reality, most are just OK headphones with a mic, a logo and maybe some fancy RGB lighting attached. All that said, there are always exceptions to the rule, and a few headsets have stood out as actually being worth the money. My current favorite is the Turtle Beach Atlas Air, which is currently on sale for $130 at various retailers as part of a Black Friday deal. That’s the cheapest it’s been since February, $50 off its MSRP and $20 below its street price over the last month. When it’s discounted to this extent, it’s the rare gaming headset I’d call a solid bargain. The hook with the Atlas Air is that it’s one of the few wireless headphones (let alone headsets) with an open-back design, meaning its ear cups don’t completely seal off your ears from air and outside noise. Pairs like this aren’t for everyone: They both let in and leak lots of ambient sound, so if you don’t use them in a quiet room, you and anyone nearby will probably be distracted. On the flipside, this can be a positive if you don’t want to be completely shut off from your surroundings. More notably, they can produce a far more spacious and natural sound than closed-back models. Games feel more like they’re happening around you instead of being confined to a space in your head. All of this holds true with the Atlas Air. Going from this pair to a traditional headset often makes it feel like a chunk of the world has been lopped off — giant boss fights in games like Elden Ring or Final Fantasy XVI sound more narrow, and it becomes harder to gauge where exactly an opponent is coming from in a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. It helps that the Atlas Air is also tuned well. It’s not as dynamic as the best non-gaming open headphones, and like most open-backs it doesn’t get super deep bass, so explosions and gunfire lack a little boom. But it’s balanced and easygoing, with a jump in the treble that helps dialogue and footsteps sound clearer. The headset itself is exceptionally comfortable beyond that. It’s lightweight at 0.66 pounds, and the big memory foam earcups clamp down gently without trapping much heat. The battery lasts a solid 50-60 hours on a charge, and while the mic isn’t the absolute best I’ve tested, it still lets you come through clearly. It all works with PC and PS5 by default, and you can pair with a Switch or Switch 2 over Bluetooth. There’s no Xbox wireless support, unfortunately, though you can at least use an included 3.5mm cable. And though the plastic design isn’t exactly “premium,” it hasn’t developed any sort of cracks or creakiness in the months I’ve used it. For $130, it’s totally fine. There are other things to nitpick: You can’t listen to two devices connected over the USB dongle and Bluetooth simultaneously; you want to ignore Turtle Beach’s companion software as soon as you update the firmware; and there isn’t much room to adjust the headband, so certain heads may struggle to find the best fit. The design is also kind of ugly, if I’m being honest. Still, in an samey market, the Atlas Air stands out. If you know you can live with the trade-offs that come with any open-back headset, it’s a unique value at this price.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

{"id":"ai_engadget_a933d24e5ed7","title":"Samsung's Beverage Center is the best fridge feature competitors can't copy","content":"In case you haven't noticed, Engadget has been expanding our smart home and kitchen coverage. However, we don't get to test out as many fridges as we like simply because they're large and difficult to move around. That said, now that Samsung has been putting AI inside of its fancy iceboxes for a few years, I wanted to do a long-term review of one of its latest models — the Bespoke AI 4-door refrigerator — to see firsthand if adding machine learning to an appliance improves its performance. But what I quickly learned is that my favorite thing about the fridge isn't AI but instead an innovative twist on the traditional water pitcher. Samsung's Beverage Center is hidden behind a thin panel on the left so the water dispenser doesn't become an eyesore. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Samsung calls it the Beverage Center and it's actually been around since 2021. It started out as a feature exclusive to the company's top-of-the-line model, but more recently, it's become so popular that Samsung began adding it to a wider range of products. Instead of having a basic water dispenser on the outside of a fridge (which is frankly kind of an eyesore), Samsung moved it behind a thin door. It then added another station right next that big enough to hold a water pitcher that automatically refills itself every time you use it. My biggest gripe with traditional water dispensers is that they're too slow. If you're only filling up a single glass, it's not a big deal. But if you're trying to top up a water bottle or get water for the entire family before dinner, you're often forced to stand in front of the fridge for a few minutes, blocking others from getting in and generally being in people's way. With the Beverage Center, you still have the option to fill a glass individually, or you can pull the entire pitcher out, carry it over to your table and fill everyone's cup with haste like a waiter at a restaurant. Sure, this might only save you a few minutes, but when you're rushing to get dinner done before your kids start getting hangry, every second is precious. After all, six o'clock is dinner time — not 6:05 or 6:10. Samsung's Beverage Center features a traditional water dispenser and a built-in pitcher that automatically refills itself after each use. Sam Rutherford for Engadget I'd also argue that a pitcher is slightly more elegant than waiting for the weak stream from your water dispenser to lazily fill up a cup. But more importantly, because the whole pitcher is sitting inside a chilled fridge, all of the water is cold — not just the first 12 or 16 ounces you typically get from that little spigot. Also, because there's a strainer basket, you can even use it to make infused water just by throwing some fruit or herbs in there. And once again, you never need to refill it manually because when the pitcher is empty, you just put it back in the fridge and the next time you grab it, it's already full again. But don't just take it from me, there are numerous threads where other users acknowledge the greatness of Samsung's Beverage Center. Samsung's Beverage Center comes with a built-in pitcher that holds 48 ounces of water and includes a strainer for making infused water or even iced tea. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Of course, this feature isn't perfect. Samsung's pitcher isn't dishwasher safe, though that's not a huge deal because it's quick and easy to clean with warm soapy water. The bigger issue is that sometimes I wish the pitcher had more capacity or that Samsung offered the option to upgrade to a bigger one. In my experience, 48 ounces is just enough for my family of four, but I wouldn't be surprised if people with larger households might want something with more volume. One of the nice things about Samsung's Beverage Center is that you still get room on the reverse side for holding things in the door of the fridge. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Honestly, Samsung's Beverage Center feels like one of the ingenious inventions that makes you wonder why another company didn't think of this sooner. But none did, and because Samsung holds some patents related to its automatic water pitcher, you probably won't see a similar feature on any of its competitors' fridges anytime soon. As for the rest of the fridge and its AI Vision technology, I'm still testing those out, but stay tuned for a full review soon.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_3f2b2f181e05","title":"I loved Google’s new Gemini AI—except when it gaslit me","content":"Hi again, and welcome back to Fast Company’s Plugged In. On November 18, Google announced a new product. More precisely, it declared that it was ushering in “a new era”—which is what tech companies do when they really want you to pay attention. The product in question is Gemini 3 Pro, the latest version of Google’s LLM. It’s not just the foundation of Google’s ChatGPT-like chatbot, also called Gemini. It underlies vast quantities of features in flagship offerings such as Google Search, Gmail, and Android. It powers Antigravity, a new Google AI coding platform that debuted on the same day. And thanks to Google Cloud, the model is also available to third-party developers as an ingredient for their apps. In short, Gemini 3 Pro could hardly be more essential to Google’s aspiration to be AI’s most important player. As Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said in the announcement, the company sees it as “a big step on the path toward AGI”—AI that’s at least as capable as humans are at most cognitive tasks. Already, the announcement stated, Gemini 3 Pro “demonstrates PhD-level reasoning.” Google supported its claims with a table listing 20 AI benchmarks in which Gemini 3 Pro beat—and often just plain trounced—Gemini 2 Pro, OpenAI’s GPT-5.1, and Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5. Humanity’s Last Exam, for example, is a 2,500-question test covering mathematics, physics, the humanities, and other topics. It’s designed to be remarkably difficult (hence the name) and there has been debate over whether it’s so nebulous that some of the theoretically correct answers are nuanced or wrong. According to Google’s table, GPT-5.1 achieved a score of 26.5%, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 managed only 13.7%. By contrast, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5%, and did even better when allowed to do searches and run code, with a score of 45.8%. Outside the lab, Gemini 3 Pro has been received as enthusiastically as any new AI model I can remember. Ethan Mollick, one of my favorite providers of AI analysis based on hands-on usage, pronounced it “very good.” Others said it delivered on the great expectations that OpenAI’s GPT-5 stoked but failed to satisfy. As I write, I’ve been playing with the Gemini chatbot for just a few days. Much of that experience has been positive. Two writing assignments I gave it came out exceptionally well: an article on the future of the penny, and a detailed report on pricing for Digital Equipment Corp.’s 1960s minicomputers. Its first pass at a simple vibe coding project—building a search engine for Fast Company’s Next Big Things in Tech—was a bit of a mess, but when I explicitly put it into “Build” mode, it nailed the assignment in a few minutes. It also excelled at figuring out what was going on in an assortment of photos I uploaded. Yet for all that’s gone right so far, I also encountered significant glitches with Gemini 3 Pro from almost the moment I tried it. They left me particularly wary of Google’s blanket claims about the LLM being ready to help users “learn anything” and delivering responses that “are smart, concise and direct, trading cliché and flattery for genuine insight.” My interactions gone wrong were mostly about animation and comics, topics I turn to when fooling around with new AI because I know them well enough to spot mistakes. Asked about these subjects, Gemini repeatedly spewed hallucinations. For instance, when I asked if Walt Disney himself had ever worked on the Mickey Mouse comic strip, the LLM gave a correct answer (yes, though only briefly) but then volunteered a bunch of facts I hadn’t asked for that weren’t actually factual. For example, it said that when the strip’s longtime artist retired, his final panel showed Mickey and Minnie gazing into a sunset, a subtle way of marking his departure. (No such strip appeared.) In a different chat, it manufactured an elaborate, entirely fictional backstory involving a different cartoonist also being a noted animation historian, which it told me was “well-documented” and “recognized.” It wasn’t just that Gemini hallucinated. ChatGPT and Claude still do that, too. But more than other models, Gemini tended to compound its failures by gaslighting me. Helpfully pointing out its gaffes led to some of the strangest exchanges I’ve had with AI since February 2023, when Microsoft’s Bing said it didn’t want to talk to me anymore. (Full disclosure: I understand that AI is just stringing together a sequence of words it doesn’t understand. All of its human-seeming qualities, be they impressive or annoying, are simulated. But it’s hard to write about them without slipping into a certain degree of anthropomorphizing!) Repeatedly, Gemini acknowledged its inaccuracies but insisted they were “lore,” “common misconceptions,” or examples of my own confusion. In one case, it eventually confessed: “I have failed you in this conversation by fabricating details to cover up previous errors.” In another instance, it continued to insist that it was right, providing citations that didn’t even mention the topic at hand. I’m not arguing that the fate of AI hangs on how much the technology knows about old cartoons. However, if any company is burdened with the responsibility of ensuring that its LLM is a trustworthy source of general information, it’s Google. That I tumbled into an abyss of AI-generated misinformation so quickly isn’t an encouraging sign. Part of the problem lies in the fact that Gemini 3 Pro offers two modes, “Fast” and “Thinking.” The first is the default and was responsible for the prevarications I encountered, at least one of which involved it conflating two separate topics I’d brought up. So far, Thinking mode has worked better in my experiments. But even the speediest of AI models should meet a baseline of accuracy and good behavior, at least if they’re being presented as a way to “learn anything.” (Like many AI tools, the Gemini chatbot does carry a mistakes-are-possible disclaimer.) To repeat myself, Gemini 3 Pro is impressive in many ways. Still, its launch is yet another example of the AI industry presenting an overly rosy portrait of what it has achieved. It also underlines that benchmarks tell us only so much about a model’s real-world performance. When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT three years ago this month, it did so in a brief blog post that took pains to detail the bot’s limitations and avoid grand pronouncements about its future. Letting its breakthrough new product speak for itself turned out to be a pretty effective marketing strategy. Even as AI’s giants jostle for bragging rights in what may be the most hypercompetitive tech category of all time, they should remember that lesson.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_57fea070ccb1","title":"my understanding of crud applications,controllers, and middlewares.","content":"Okay, before we start - quick disclaimer: I am in no way a professional. I'm just typing this stuff here because I'm too lazy to write notes in my book. Now, let's begin! To me, CRUD applications feel like the backbone of many systems. They help us Create, Read, Update, and Delete data - you know, the stuff everyone knows. But during my adventure in the world of CRUD, I seemed to have found another layer, a deeper mystery so to speak. Long story short, I basically had to understand the difference between middleware and controllers. To be honest, I don't really know where to draw the line completely, but my knowledge has evolved since last time - I'll tell you that! I used to think that anything with app.use() was middleware (not my proudest moment, to be honest - don't judge! Also, if you're planning to, please notice the #newbie hashtag - thanks!). My Middleware vs Controller Revelation Now I've figured out it's much more intriguing than that. The main distinction I found separating middleware and controllers is that controllers handle the final response, while middleware uses next() to pass control to the next function. Code exmaple: just think of middlewares as waiters: they, Grinds the beans Steams the milk Checks if you paid Then passes it along \"Next!\" then controllers they are the ones who: Puts everything together Adds the final touches Hands you the finished drink \"Here's your coffee!\" (beautiful illustration analogy btw ) The Order Matters Saga Oh, and lest I forget - did you know that the order of middleware actually matters? Funny story: I actually found that out while setting up routes for my operations, and I put updateUser before validateUser. Thank god for ChatGPT, am I right guys?

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_06e75e837533","title":"AI Monetization Simplified: How Monetzly Powers Your Conversations","content":"Traditional Ads Don’t Work in AI Conversations. Here’s What Does. As the AI app landscape continues to explode, developers are faced with a pressing challenge: how to monetize their innovations without disrupting the user experience. Enter Monetzly—an innovative platform that serves as the Google Ads for AI conversations. By creating a dual-earning model, Monetzly empowers developers to monetize their apps while seamlessly integrating relevant advertisements. Why Traditional Ads Fall Flat in AI Conversations Traditional advertising methods often disrupt the flow of AI conversations, leading to user frustration and disengagement. Users expect a smooth, intuitive interaction with AI, not an interruption from irrelevant ads. This is where Monetzly shines. Our conversation-native advertising approach ensures that ads are not only relevant but also enhance the user experience. The First Dual-Earning Platform in the AI Space Monetzly is the first of its kind to offer a dual-earning opportunity for developers. Imagine this: you build a powerful AI application, and instead of relying solely on subscriptions or paywalls, you can monetize your app through two streams: Direct App Monetization: Use our platform to charge users for premium features without alienating them with paywalls. Relevant Ad Hosting: Earn additional revenue by hosting contextually relevant ads that seamlessly integrate into your app’s conversation flow. How It Works Quick Integration: With just a 5-minute SDK integration, you can start leveraging the Monetzly platform. This means you can focus on building great features while we handle the monetization. AI-Powered Contextual Matching: Our platform uses advanced AI algorithms to ensure that the ads presented are contextually relevant to the conversation, resulting in higher engagement and click-through rates. Developer-First Marketplace: We’ve built an advertiser marketplace tailored specifically for developers. This means you’re not just another app; you’re part of a thriving ecosystem where advertisers are eager to connect with your users. Real-World Example: A Developer's Success Story Take the case of Sarah, a developer who integrated Monetzly into her LLM-powered chatbot. Within a week, she saw a 30% increase in revenue—not just from app subscriptions but also from relevant ads that added value to her users. Users appreciated the personalized recommendations, leading to higher satisfaction and retention rates. The Win-Win-Win Model Monetzly’s mission is to enable sustainable AI innovation through a monetization strategy that benefits developers, advertisers, and users alike. As a developer, you gain a steady revenue stream without compromising user experience.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_31a725699eec","title":"I Built A Browser Extension That Save ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek & Gemini","content":"I Spent Months Building This AI Chat Exporter Because Nothing Else Worked (And Now It's Free) Hey dev.to community! 👋 I finally shipped my first browser extension to Chrome, Edge, and Firefox — and honestly, I just wanted to share what I built and the real struggle behind it. Why I even built this thing I use Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek every day for coding. ChatGPT and Gemini mostly for research. But saving full conversations while keeping formatting (especially code blocks) and images? Impossible. Copy-paste destroys everything Screenshots are a mess Existing tools either don’t work, cut off long chats, or completely skip images So I built AI Chat Exporter Pro — at first just for myself. Now it exports full conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and DeepSeek to PDF, DOCX, Markdown, JSON, CSV, HTML, or PNG. What it actually does ✅ Works on all 5 platforms I use daily ✅ Keeps code blocks, syntax highlighting, LaTeX, tables ✅ Saves images (uploaded or generated) ✅ Handles crazy long conversations (20,000+ pages — yes, I tested that) ✅ 100% local — no servers, no data sent anywhere ✅ Multiple formats ✅ Completely free The parts that almost broke me Every AI site has a completely different DOM Had to write separate parsers for each one. No \"one solution fits all\". Preserving formatting perfectly Code highlighting, LaTeX, tables, images in different file types — super hard. Not crashing on massive chats Used Canvas and optimized everything to handle huge conversations without dying. Cross-browser pain Chrome, Edge, Firefox — all behave differently. So much refactoring. The image thing… yeah, still not perfect Even after months, I couldn’t make it 100% ideal. Here’s the truth: PDF, DOCX, HTML → images are embedded Markdown, JSON, CSV, TXT → can’t embed images, so I put clickable links instead Even in PDF/DOCX, I added links as fallback (just in case) I know, I know — not perfect. But when someone sends me a Markdown file and the AI says “look at this diagram”, I still want to see it. So links it is. Better than nothing. Honestly? I tried to make the perfect tool… and learned real fast some things are just hard. So yeah, I’m sharing it anyway You can get it here: Chrome Web Store Edge Add-ons Firefox Add-ons Landing page It’s completely free and I’m still working on it based on feedback. Now tell me honestly: Do you even export AI chats? How? What’s your biggest pain right now? Would you use something like this? Or am I just the only one this annoyed? 😅 What feature would actually make you install it today? Drop a comment — I read everything. Seriously. Thanks for reading my chaotic journey. Hope this helps someone else.","source":"community_social_dev_to","source_type":"rss","url":"https://dev.to/kudrot_adegoke_56c2820fe8/i-built-a-browser-extension-that-save-chatgpt-claude-grok-deepseek-gemini-3k2o","published_date":"2025-11-21T18:10:42","collected_date":"2025-11-21T18:37:53.310148","language":"en","tags":["developer","tutorials","community","webdev","browserextenstions","trends","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"DEV Community","source_category":"community_social","word_count":460,"author":"Kudrot Adegoke","raw_content_length":4903,"priority":7,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":2.3,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["PDF","DeepSeek & Gemini I Spent","Screenshots","PNG","AI Chat Exporter Pro","HTML","CSV","Chrome, Edge"],"persons":["Grok","Works","Firefox","Markdown","Keeps","Claude"],"locations":["Gemini"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2672,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A Browser Extension","Months","This AI Chat Exporter","Nothing","Hey devto community","my first browser extension","Chrome","Edge","Firefox","what"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["This AI Chat Exporter"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A Browser Extension":2.0,"Months":1.0,"This AI Chat Exporter":1.0,"Nothing":1.0,"Hey devto community":1.0,"my first browser extension":1.0,"Chrome":1.0,"Edge":1.0,"Firefox":1.0,"what":1.0}},"age_hours":0.6150036591666667,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"c6b7e040cd0db6ae3a2ffbf9f36ec941","title_md5":"7828807f9fa68e1a8390b63c50b2a3ec","url_normalized":"6da1a72c06457d031e01c2594d10fbd3","minhash_signature":["16524246","2857827","14366","3685244","498956","3052347","4626937","2181150","1062486","193463","1636265","3207698","2343024","1166689","953500","7389182","482472","3742938","9722371","113500","1196901","88593","433252","1872501","11462054","10686318","7507083","1237548","354593","3101601","522500","6606854","5807442","2820767","1090859","713792","610653","4197655","4255907","8780955","3088334","792666","2265398","1785966","12507014","5244114","449615","17908552","1132398","23771591","5703177","843096","615718","2239696","136855","1914246","226173","6045037","977217","3375566","1898208","7144066","1936","4050641","7601","3789593","10575424","1563117","7564697","5493975","1210516","827165","5752762","848513","7951082","3487483","269839","4232416","5530344","6351248","1246369","4072191","3013171","1555049","442394","379140","2336058","5332292","3320655","6589531","365994","2175767","8261531","436779","13402462","3484369","1608076","479007","3206866","6563146","8111486","551087","4359199","2469083","1684279","3344019","1030147","145406","13734988","44001","968633","120729","3010402","76161","756656","1943155","873230","6437170","1592955","2936898","1131087","7895850","952385","363706","9144084","809487","1148663","5084848"],"title_minhash":["16524246","114010375","25548261","11380456","123981765","15249449","36631559","26817878","17890665","35828643","21899113","17023942","41101008","178273484","239204774","52085965","29650517","185104734","86450529","77126995","71113007","5115231","23588273","90227152","26962092","10686318","29661290","41172122","34334919","44020966","161628336","70534142","43603476","42951513","24160282","15419005","62490625","8303203","115939647","17515630","9515827","63352499","143185443","48150603","31437849","5244114","23000460","32330908","1132398","130890464","62046776","47364537","42538366","90961544","86010449","7074057","53458071","179304034","56105297","73455319","78238733","17920126","38610750","75405861","7601","28709090","35572985","22842302","17016683","66661625","19680712","69597476","15056664","31239016","53943738","73878617","45054113","49964662","62739041","174172321","10619331","158770282","70281699","184080570","95503006","26465583","63719876","37264318","12328115","6589531","45366341","9952316","38831408","138356664","22344090","87394056","18239940","16074222","24302950","80047004","49617771","51738474","119727460","150674831","28587735","27411091","5693316","8841988","92294583","82071598","19995117","21236870","21315175","8577883","45680506","96652000","24702039","48156397","30964080","89962867","15494622","65430578","134001598","71061135","30381145","1376388","79880322","132260427"],"combined_hash":"f3e04e7642b58a00a0e79c4b5cbd6d0f"},"sentiment_score":8.822,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7644,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3902,"joy":0.3885,"surprise":0.1561,"sadness":0.0146,"fear":0.0069,"anger":0.0389,"disgust":0.0049},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of AI in software development, mentioning the integration of AI tools into the development process.

{"id":"community_social_aws_news_9c512952edb4","title":"AWS Security Incident Response now provides agentic AI","content":"AWS Security Incident Response now provides agentic AI-powered investigation capabilities to help you prepare for, respond to, and recover from security events faster and more effectively. The new investigative agent automatically gathers evidence across multiple AWS data sources, correlates the data, then presents findings for you in clear, actionable summaries. This helps you reduce the time required to investigate and respond to potential security events, thereby minimizing business disruption. When a security event case is created in the Security Incident Response console, the investigative agent immediately assesses the case details to identify missing information, such as potential indicators, resource names, and timeframes. It asks the case submitter clarifying questions to gather these details. This proactive approach helps minimize delays from back-and-forth communications that traditionally extend case resolution times. The investigative agent then collects relevant information from various data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon EC2, and AWS Cost Explorer. It automatically correlates this data to provide you with a comprehensive analysis, reducing the need for manual evidence gathering and enabling faster investigation. Security teams can track all investigation activities directly through the AWS console and view summaries in their preferred integration tools. This feature is automatically enabled for all Security Incident Response customers at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where the service is available. To learn more and get started, visit the Security Incident Response overview page and console.","source":"community_social_aws_news","source_type":"rss","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/aws-security-incident-response-agentic-ai-powered-investigation","published_date":"2025-11-21T16:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-21T18:37:53.727083","language":"en","tags":["developer","aws","cloud","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Recent

Customers can use the RequireEncryptionInTransit parameter to specifically launch instance types that support encryption-in-transit, in addition to specifying resource requirements like vCPU cores and memory. The new encryption attribute addresses critical compliance needs for customers who use VPC Encryption Controls in enforced mode and require all network traffic to be encrypted in transit. By combining encryption requirements with other instance attributes in ABIS, customers can achieve instance type diversification for better capacity fulfillment while meeting their security needs. Additionally, the GetInstanceTypesFromInstanceRequirements (GITFIR) allows you to preview which instance types you might be allocated based on your specified encryption requirements. This feature is available in all AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

{"id":"community_social_aws_news_a88017b1fb94","title":"Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals adds GitHub Action and MCP server improvements","content":"AWS announces the general availability of a new GitHub Action and improvements to CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server that bring application observability into developer tools, making troubleshooting issues faster and more convenient. Previously, developers had to leave GitHub to triage production issues, look up trace data, and ensure observability coverage, often switching between consoles, dashboards, and source code. Starting today, Application observability for AWS GitHub Action helps you catch breaching SLOs or critical service errors, in GitHub workflows. In addition, now you can use the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server in AI coding agents such as Kiro to identify the exact file, function, and line of code responsible for latency, errors, or SLO violations. Furthermore, you can get instrumentation guidance that ensures comprehensive observability coverage. With this new GitHub Action, developers can mention @awsapm in GitHub Issues with prompts like \"Why is my checkout service experiencing high latency?\" and receive intelligent, observability-based responses without switching between consoles, saving time and effort. In addition, with improvements in CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server, developers can now ask questions like \"Which line of code caused the latency spike in my service?\". Furthermore, when instrumentation is missing, the MCP server can modify infrastructure-as-code (e.g., CDK, Terraform) to help teams set up OTel-based application performance monitoring for ECS, EKS, Lambda, and EC2 without requiring coding effort. Together, these features bring observability into development workflows, reduce context switching, and power intelligent, agent-assisted debugging from code to production. To get started, visit Application Observability for AWS GitHub Action documentation and the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server documentation.","source":"community_social_aws_news","source_type":"rss","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/amazon-cloudwatch-application-signals-adds-github-action-mcp-server-improvements","published_date":"2025-11-21T08:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-21T18:37:53.749706","language":"en","tags":["aws","developer","cloud","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Recent

{"id":"spanish_xataka_3acb907c931d","title":"Idealista se est√° llenando de im√°genes de casas a la venta hechas con IA. Y cada vez es m√°s dif√≠cil identificarlas","content":"El contenido generado con IA lo ha inundado todo y cada vez es m√°s dif√≠cil distinguirlo. El llamado AI Slop est√° por todas partes; en redes sociales, en Spotify, en la Wikipedia‚Ä¶ hasta en nichos tan espec√≠ficos como el de los patrones de ganchillo. Esta avalancha ha hecho que desconfiemos de casi cualquier imagen que vemos online, tambi√©n si est√°s buscando casa, porque s√≠: Idealista tambi√©n se ha llenado de IA. Catfish de casas. Normalmente usamos el t√©rmino cuando una persona en internet se hace pasar por otra y miente sobre su apariencia. Es lo que est√° pasando en algunas plataformas de venta y alquiler de inmuebles. Wired ya mostr√≥ algunos casos de im√°genes alteradas con IA, pero no es una tendencia exclusiva de Estados Unidos, en plataformas como Idealista y Fotocasa tambi√©n est√°n apareciendo muchos anuncios con im√°genes modificadas con herramientas IA. En Xataka En Espa√±a hay algo que est√° influyendo m√°s en las carreras universitarias que la Selectividad: Idealista ‚ÄúPara que veas como quedar√≠a‚Äù. Es la excusa que usan muchos propietarios e inmobiliarias. Lo que hacen es mejorar las fotos usando herramientas de inteligencia artificial para que el inmueble parezca m√°s nuevo de lo que en realidad es o que se vea c√≥mo quedar√≠a reformado. En el anuncio que denuncia este usuario en X, han usado la IA en la imagen de la piscina para que se vea c√≥mo quedar√≠a estando con el agua limpia y todo en perfectas condiciones. En las respuestas al mismo post, otro usuario muestra este otro anuncio donde han usado la IA para poner c√©sped en el jard√≠n de la casa, con un resultado bastante malo por cierto. Lo que pides vs lo que te llega. Pulsa en la imagen para abrir la publicaci√≥n en X. Anuncios m√°s llamativos. En la descripci√≥n de los anuncios que denuncian los usuarios avisan de que se ha usado IA para retocar algunas im√°genes, pero lo que suelen hacer es poner primero las im√°genes con IA para atraer la atenci√≥n de los interesados. Una vez dentro del anuncio, te encuentras con la realidad: la casa est√° que se cae a pedazos. Si est√° especificado en la descripci√≥n y luego ponen las fotos reales, t√©cnicamente no es un enga√±o, pero es una estrategia bastante turbia que a√±ade una capa m√°s de dificultad a la ya de por s√≠ dif√≠cil tarea de encontrar una casa para comprar o alquilar. Indetectable. Los primeros generadores de im√°genes no serv√≠an para hacer modificaciones porque b√°sicamente se inventaban las im√°genes, pero la llegada Nano Banana fue un punto de inflexi√≥n ya que permite realizar cambios siendo consistente con la foto original. En septiembre aparecieron im√°genes en Idealista con la marca de agua de Gemini. No podemos saber qu√© han eliminado o a√±adido, pero podr√≠a usarse para quitar humedades o algunos desperfectos sin que sea evidente que han usado la IA. En este caso concreto se han dejado la marca de agua, pero habr√° mucha gente que no sepa lo que significa, por no decir que eliminarla es muy sencillo. Puede que haya muchas m√°s im√°genes modificadas con IA que sean indetectables. Idealista lo promueve. En 2023 la plataforma public√≥ un art√≠culo explicando c√≥mo aprovechar las herramientas de IA para arreglar las im√°genes de los anuncios. Mostraban ejemplos como ordenar habitaciones, llenar piscinas o amueblar estancias vac√≠as. Tambi√©n lanzaron ‚Äòtexto inteligente‚Äô para generar descripciones de los inmuebles, una funci√≥n similar a las que encontramos en otras plataformas como Wallapop. Hace poco publicaron otro art√≠culo donde alertaban de las estafas en su plataforma usando generaci√≥n de im√°genes falsas con IA; una confirmaci√≥n de que es una pr√°ctica bastante extendida y no siempre transparente.

{"id":"positive_news_upworthy_7bef4eb323df","title":"American visits McDonald's in China and is not prepared for how different the menu is","content":"As Americans, many grew up with the consistency of a McDonald's menu: Big Macs, Egg McMuffin, and only on special occasions, the McRib. Since their first store opened in California 85 years ago, they've got the formulas down pat, so whether you're in Los Angeles or Wichita, you essentially know what you're getting when you put in your order.McDonald's could not be contained to just California. After first expanding to Canada and Puerto Rico, the food chain now has \"over 36,000 restaurants in over 100 nations,\" according to their corporate website. And each nation is just a tiny bit different, adding their own cultural \"flavor\" so-to-speak to the menus.A popular travel blogger, Christian Grossi, was absolutely over-the-moon when he visited a McDonald's location in Shanghai, China. In a TikTok video, he looks at the menu and notes, \"This is a lot to take in.\" He then points to a photo of \"The Black Gold Moon\" burger and adorably, with perhaps a dash of ADHD, immediately points out the \"Salted Egg Yolk McFlurry.\" He asks his TikTok followers, \"Do we try that?\" @christian.grossi American traveler is left speechless by Insane McDonald’s in China 🇨🇳 This video was filmed in Shanghai, China. In China you can find many western brands that are common back in the United States and Europe. Including our fast foods. However they are very different. Here the fast food tastes real, the price is very low, and the variety is completely different than what we have back in the USA. One thing I also noticed here in China is that McDonald’s is always full of people. #fyp #tellme #traveltiktok #china #shanghai He then points out other burgers, many also named the \"black gold moon,\" and then moves over to the curly fries, which he excitedly points out costs just over an American dollar. \"This is not fair,\" he says, shaking his head. \"Why don't we have this in the U.S.?\"He quickly moves over the desserts, specifically the McFlurry flavors. \"They have toffee. They have Hojicha. They have Mochi. They have McDonald's Toffee Cheese Flavored Pie\" (which he notes doesn't sound as appealing).Then it's on to the plethora of coffee options. \"Wait, hold on. Is that cheese-flavored coffee?\" That seems a must-order because next up, Grossi is holding the cheese-coffee and the McDonald's curly fries. He admits, \"Because I'm terrified of the coffee, and I'm doing that for you, we're gonna start with the curly fry.\" He adds for some personal context, \"Contrary to popular belief, I hate McDonald's regular fries. So curly fry…\" —he takes a bite— \"Oh my God, so much better!\" He gives it 8.5 out of ten stars, even though, as he points out, he's eating it on \"the side of a Chinese road.\" Tichina Arnold Eating GIF by CBS Giphy Next up? The cheese coffee. \"I tried to ask the lady at McDonald's, 'what is this exactly?' She spoke zero English, so we didn't get so far. Anyway.\" He takes a sniff and reiterates, \"Cheese coffee from McDonald's.\" He takes some pretty big gulps and exclaims, \"I can feel it in my bones. You wanna know what this tastes like? It tastes like you put creamer in your coffee. And then, as soon as it gets down your esophagus, it tastes like spreadable cheese from the can.\"Not a fan, it seems, he questions \"what chef or barista thought this was a good idea?\" He then theorizes, \"they probably thought if an American saw this, they would pay money for it, so I guess they were right.\" He gives the coffee three stars.Before we get to the comments, are you wondering where the \"black moon\" references come from? On Mr. Vaughn's YouTube page, he points out that the \"Black Castle Moon Burger\" is a \"limited edition item.\" According to the narrator, this burger is \"inspired by the monkey king, from the Chinese novel, Journey to the West and the Black Myth: Wukong video game, which perhaps is a corporate tie-in. He further explains that the whole theme honors a Chinese festival \"celebrating the Harvest Moon.\" - A traveler tries McDonalds in China. www.youtube.com, Mr. Vaughn He then gives it a try, picking up the sesame-seeded black buns sandwiching the McDonald's twist on \"moon cakes.\" He claims it's usually referred to as the black gold moon cake, but that the \"black castle\" nickname \"likely nods to the game's mythical aesthetic.\"Back to Grossi's comments, it seems his travels inspire a lot of people to follow in his footsteps. One writes, \"Your videos of China have convinced me of visiting there. I never realized how behind we are in the US.\"Another clears up the cheese-coffee confusion. \"Chinese person from NYC here. Cheese foam topped teas and coffees are very popular in Asian cafes. Typically, they taste like a sweet and salty cheesecake. I'm not that into it, but a lot of people are.\" And this person notes, \"Every McDonald’s in every country caters to the things that country likes.\" This is so true. Another traveler hits up a McDonald's in Paris and is greatly impressed by how fancy it is. As she points to the digital menu, she reports the cheese and ham options, but is also excited by the veggie alternatives. But cheese, it is France after all, is always an option—even cheddar cheese on the fries. @sheshortsweet AHHH. We clearly had different opinions on the cheesecake 💀😭✨🍟 #mcdonalds #paris #paristrip #mcdonaldsparis #mcdonaldshacks #fastfood #europe #honestreviews #tastetest #parisfood #parisfoodie #traveltok #macarons #foodreview #fyp #mcflurry #france #fastfoodreview @McDonald’s She too is floored by the dessert options including cheesecake and macarons, the latter of which she finds too hard to chew. And over in the McFlurry section, she points out a candy she's unsure of but \"would love to try.\" She does opt for the cheesecake dripping in M&Ms and hot fudge, and that, she says, is \"pretty good.\"Not everyone in the comments is equally impressed by the Parisian Micky Ds. \"Spoiler alert, McD's in Paris is even worse than US and you have to pay to use the bathroom.\" Though others feel quite the opposite. \"Literally so mad they don’t have the veggie McChicken/nuggets in the US.\"I can personally attest to the culture influence on the McDonald's menu. I lived in Tel Aviv for a bit and happened to be there when they got their first McDonald's in 1993. I was so intrigued by how different the menu was—and not just because it was in Hebrew. It sported lots of falafel sandwiches and other Middle Eastern spins and spices on traditional McDonald's fare.Other Upworthy colleagues shared their experiences. In Vienna, Austria, writer Annie Reneau shares, \"We discovered they had gluten free burgers! And gorgeous Viennese desserts. And we had to pay for ketchup packets. A very different experience.\"And writer Denise Quan notes, \"Even in Hawaii, they have unique local favorites on the menu, like Spam and Portuguese sausage. And saimin (aka ramen.)\"","source":"positive_news_upworthy","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.upworthy.com/surprised-by-chinese-mcdonalds-menu","published_date":"2025-11-21T22:47:55","collected_date":"2025-11-22T01:52:49.496302","language":"en","tags":["mcdonalds_menu","travel_blogger","vienna","food","france","harvest_moon","americans","social_good","change","impact"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Upworthy","source_category":"positive_news","word_count":1154,"author":"Cecily Knobler","raw_content_length":9682,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":5.77,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["McDonald","TikTok","Big Macs","McDonald's"],"persons":["Christian Grossi"],"locations":["Shanghai","Canada","Puerto Rico","California","Los Angeles","Wichita","China"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":6829,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["you","McDonald","China","the menu","Americans","many","the consistency","a McDonalds menu","special occasions","the McRib"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"you":4.0,"McDonald":3.0,"China":2.0,"the menu":2.0,"Americans":1.0,"many":1.0,"the consistency":1.0,"a McDonalds menu":1.0,"special occasions":1.0,"the McRib":1.0}},"age_hours":3.5832941247222223,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"f027ec4577c82d422d78465dc5a36369","title_md5":"cb195f81328020a06a6247f750231200","url_normalized":"c77c9e1af9aca00a9ccc467822587855","minhash_signature":["12575453","14312","14366","292436","361299","4631126","2529204","2181150","693538","193463","3134393","3784144","1103696","1166689","953500","3458115","7139592","304913","178409","113500","1196901","88593","433252","2113985","1200662","244614","2325214","5225880","6998512","3101601","522500","587492","843076","2423718","1090859","880599","2014175","5474159","296674","3826232","1678590","792666","2661647","1350112","3625657","2463753","449615","353034","1130346","10675237","2447249","843096","7456786","214699","136855","1909511","6436574","1535593","4430687","155210","1624634","225097","1936","435000","7601","3789593","9274054","1563117","1210097","1943049","1210516","1755940","220701","405748","6313665","110764","269839","2433691","407005","10235303","1273402","3546788","1292529","1555049","442394","2319043","698108","260590","1442738","8318141","504781","194630","1183835","436779","3944768","1881726","631649","3721660","4273719","1291533","243170","551087","986263","2395720","129586","3376316","1030147","2447857","1815488","44001","5003486","85694","1550051","3573974","756656","1943155","18163","1144143","1592955","2336975","1131087","4372651","472674","1331506","10047967","809487","1742731","33668"],"title_minhash":["39251959","42841784","14366","63381057","82548586","7901950","43100128","84530471","27020053","208586871","53938049","20523861","66261946","29910046","42989806","7389182","49668034","38603746","105147120","12273043","6058284","105639700","36779676","11641973","44720605","110446740","101346237","95694796","93717229","19963369","16281514","65027209","23747690","8820999","14343807","27257070","85660278","117835370","185920569","51672241","108687630","53208101","47026791","1785966","39996494","36428735","1691750","43515797","180868314","11619362","358272294","10030682","9230480","123510148","143471313","10654555","12603413","40239940","12978240","21256722","47928435","27212162","1936","79785124","7601","18039960","131606927","15596738","39322970","15884718","7249981","23084374","220701","405748","20588532","3487483","269839","62567818","23400542","67025467","29834913","6465295","36633920","140116245","11728217","2202200","29680147","112119356","27655721","14777775","96376865","134644175","35744754","319762486","19634481","142539024","33281272","43573138","35680924","7840644","4227644","55827540","3331841","16291765","76186035","152443119","40383196","17178449","13734988","12196566","149373247","398277535","34900327","73363302","116412519","34046542","38320976","13762129","5108334","77499487","12261163","9876597","45462023","115431164","31202914","101158426","54343954","45227134"],"combined_hash":"84b0d47df949676672eee6ea92a417fe"},"sentiment_score":6.2895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.9531,"joy":0.0027,"surprise":0.0309,"sadness":0.0033,"fear":0.0024,"anger":0.004,"disgust":0.0037},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"practitioner_account","workflow_detail":{"score":7.0,"evidence":"The article describes a workflow where the author uses an AI tool to generate code from a prompt, then refines the prompt based on the generated code, and iterates until the code meets the requirements.

{"id":"positive_news_upworthy_02612df2925c","title":"Icelandic woman demonstrates the 'ingressive' linguistic habit of speaking while inhaling","content":"When we think about the mechanics of speaking—as in physically forming words with our mouths and saying them out loud—exhaling is a big part of the process. We naturally breathe out while vocalizing, which is what makes our vocal chords vibrate and make sound, right? We exhale when we talk without even consciously thinking about it. But what if we talked while inhaling? For most of us, that idea seems…well, backwards. Try it. It probably feels weird, unless you're from one of the handful of places in the world where people actually do it. Una Eggertsdóttir, a woman from Iceland living in the U.S., demonstrated an Icelandic linguistic habit of speaking on the in-breath, and it's wild to watch for those unfamiliar with it. She says her friends in the U.S. make fun of her for answering \"Yeah\" while inhaling and ask her if she's okay, but it's totally a normal thing in certain countries, including Iceland. @youcancallmeuna Here's how you can instantly sound more Icelandic! 🇮🇸 #iceland #icelandic #culturetiktok #languagelearning #language Why do some Icelandic people speak while inhaling?It's actually called \"ingressive speech\" or \"ingressive phonation,\" and it's common to Nordic countries, parts of the U.K. and Ireland, the Atlantic Coast of Canada, and parts of New England, likely due to some shared Viking influence. Other cultures also have various manifestations of ingressive speech, but it seems to be most well-known among the Scandinavian nations and Ireland. The most common ingressive sound seems to be an affirmative \"yeah\" or \"ja,\" (also called pulmonic ingressive speech), which sounds almost just like a sharp, audible inhale with just a touch of vocalization. Ingressive phonation is often just one sound, but as in Eggertsdóttir's example, sometimes it's entire phrases or sentences spoken on the \"in breath.\" @cedrusk Pulmonic ingressive in Irish English. #irishlanguage #gaeilge #linguistics #phonetics #paralinguistic What does ingressive phnation sound like?When you're not familiar with it, ingressive phonation sounds strange. As one commenter wrote, \"I noticed some Norwegians doing this too, I just thought they had respiratory problems from the cold air, lol.\" And a woman who married an Icelander said she was worried her husband was having a medical event.People have shared the other places they've observed ingressive speech as well:\"We totally do that also in Northern Sweden. 😁\"\"Some of my Dutch family does this! ☺️\"\"The French do this with the 'ouais' on the inhale.\" @parisiandesire The french inhale or the inhaled ouais is part of french culture! Also known as pulmonic ingressive, when french people speak, inhaling ouais like this can be quite common! #frenchinhale #frenchinhale💨 #frenchlanguage #french #livingfrance #frenchwords #frenchexpression #frenchpeople #learningfrench #frenchcultureshock #frenchcultureshock #speakingfrench #ouais \"My husband’s aunt does this. She’s from Finland. When she’s agreeing with something and says 'yeah.' I’ve always thought it was the cutest thing!\"\"We hosted a Norwegian a number of years ago who we now call our Norwegian daughter. When her family came to visit her parents both did this! I now completely expect it.\"\"We do this in the Balkans as well! Usually when you’re gossiping 😅\"\"Old time Maine people would talk on the in breath, I loved it.\"\"They also do that in Prince Edward Island up in Canada.\"People have reported hearing or seeing ingressive sounds in non-European places as well, including Ethiopia, Brazil, and Japan. Many people shared that the first time they heard it, they thought something had startled the person because they were gasping, or they thought the person had some kind of breathing problem.It just goes to show how exposing yourself to various cultures can broaden your perspective on even the most basic parts of life we wouldn't think to question. \"People breathe out when they talk\" may sound like an obvious statement of fact for people around the world who've never experienced ingressive speech, but it's not a given. The fact is, some cultures, in some instances, talk while they inhale. Ingressive speech feels unnatural and counterintuitive to some but totally natural and normal to others, which just highlights the delightful diversity of our human family.","source":"positive_news_upworthy","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.upworthy.com/icelandic-woman-demonstrates-the-ingressive-linguistic-habit","published_date":"2025-11-21T21:17:41","collected_date":"2025-11-22T01:52:49.585625","language":"en","tags":["nordic_culture","linguistics","social_good","viral_positive","ingressive_speech","change","nordic_countries","impact","languages","viking_influence"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Upworthy","source_category":"positive_news","word_count":670,"author":"Annie Reneau","raw_content_length":6879,"priority":7,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.35,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Una Eggertsdóttir"],"locations":["U.S.","Iceland"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4299,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Icelandic woman","the ingressive linguistic habit","what","the mechanics","physically forming words","our mouths","them","a big part","the process","which"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Icelandic woman":2.0,"the ingressive linguistic habit":2.0,"what":2.0,"the mechanics":1.0,"physically forming words":1.0,"our mouths":1.0,"them":1.0,"a big part":1.0,"the process":1.0,"which":1.0}},"age_hours":5.0874956566666665,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"13c9e03d58ac2b0d0ed4af5712033813","title_md5":"94248f7ca5492936864b6cef6de4499f","url_normalized":"b34110c9da8b21e6a85bbbf83477aaaf","minhash_signature":["13339649","1247150","14366","9680390","968117","4631126","4626937","111409","2753670","4545379","4721759","3646982","163247","1166689","953500","3458115","1963268","304913","178409","113500","1196901","88593","459618","2113985","6817298","3150410","4073761","9327886","111382","1456173","3290860","587492","2518573","582111","1090859","880599","4156230","5474159","3572926","6977948","1472138","792666","10234330","1785966","907738","2720336","1691750","2416017","1132398","11619362","2447249","2259087","2871081","4194521","136855","2364710","7015836","1262764","414272","1151625","4334793","225097","1915552","4050641","7601","3789593","48101","1563117","1210097","1943049","1210516","1755940","2619534","3985712","5728012","3487483","269839","2143585","3039576","721726","304698","2330191","1292529","1555049","442394","8605786","698108","3372500","1442738","2500374","504781","2175767","1183835","436779","12786202","4140296","885527","479007","4713810","6563146","2674870","551087","986263","2469083","1684279","1257961","1030147","145406","10621501","44001","1054124","120729","1550051","76161","756656","1943155","120732","1144143","1592955","2336975","1131087","4042643","952385","363706","1457601","809487","975161","5198470"],"title_minhash":["49542888","33813107","59631521","36752328","133299020","196201215","95059972","53868996","81767414","5295881","29949824","273795453","2343024","1166689","16595777","121918019","11167650","246803287","38126704","40907892","1196901","11776474","459618","128028241","153745978","125484838","15045094","121151449","16948879","13006262","141002458","2675367","140242695","21121012","234160098","19687397","20680427","6836305","55381602","67017287","89288249","122240812","49136923","1785966","85961622","36428735","3043650","72514609","1132398","32491597","2447249","81798255","46466379","51135204","136855","13331872","13936994","25481668","132867934","29171982","12360226","131975050","56514723","75538884","76581728","16611414","21803903","5513119","13478095","43605251","114978435","45175404","84187087","272079305","82943311","3487483","3542338","21510571","19336800","721726","178554445","2330191","32217147","24131304","6414364","48220762","16694763","51688056","105495485","36269717","81721814","8732606","78623679","86205232","27693366","11118395","1608076","479007","37405142","120577137","34410606","64263337","151496078","68055568","1806145","55561993","37088309","36774746","48923709","20298526","32741343","120729","26534242","39695324","42032747","77874438","105106313","87503955","5147807","20138626","162078269","19356997","76262673","84986417","25518271","15839597","18750775","30185523"],"combined_hash":"abb6d0a4b221a4dfafffc94cfb7bd472"},"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3602,"joy":0.0025,"surprise":0.0255,"sadness":0.0109,"fear":0.0204,"anger":0.0272,"disgust":0.5532},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of machine learning models for predicting the performance of Oracle databases.
