{"id":"arxiv_4f8316d63281","title":"Model","content":"Shallow free surface flows are often characterized by both subdomains that require high modeling complexity and subdomains that can be sufficiently accurately modeled with low modeling complexity. Moreover, these subdomains may change in time as the water flows through the domain. This motivates the need for space and time adaptivity in the simulation of shallow free surface flows. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive simulations using the recently developed Shallow Water Moment Equations, which are an extension of the standard Shallow Water Equations that allow for vertically changing velocity profiles by including additional variables and equations. The model-specific modeling complexity of a shallow water moment model is determined by its order. The higher the order of the model, the more variables and equations are included in the model. Shallow water moment models are ideally suited for adaptivity because they are hierarchical such that low-order models and high-order models share the same structure. To enable adaptive simulations, we propose two approaches for the coupling of the varying-order shallow water moment equations at their boundary interfaces. The first approach dynamically updates padded state variables but cannot be written in conservative form, while the second approach uses fixed padded state variable values of zero and reduces to conservative form for conservative moment equations. The switching procedure between high-order models and low-order models is based on a new set of model error estimators, originating from a decomposition of the high-order models. Numerical results of the collision of a dam-break wave with a smooth wave yield accurate results, while achieving speedups up to 60 percent compared to a non-adaptive model with fixed modeling complexity.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25351v1","published_date":"2025-10-29T10:11:07","collected_date":"2025-10-30T07:24:27.671459","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","physicsflu-dyn","csna","mathna","35f50_65m08_76d33","engineering","engineering_systems"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.25351v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25351v1.pdf","authors":["Rik

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_34737a17db50","title":"Towards Enhanced Image Generation Via Multi","content":"arXiv:2503.01298v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Unified generative models have shown remarkable performance in text and image generation. For image synthesis tasks, they adopt straightforward text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, direct T2I generation limits the models in handling complex compositional instructions, which frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Although this issue is vital, existing works mainly focus on improving the basic image generation capability of the models. While such improvements help to some extent, they still fail to adequately resolve the problem. Inspired by Chain of Thought (CoT) solving complex problems step by step, this work aims to introduce CoT into unified generative models to address the challenges of complex image generation that direct T2I generation cannot effectively solve, thereby endowing models with enhanced image generation ability. To achieve this, we first propose Functionality-oriented eXperts (FoXperts), an expert-parallel architecture in our model FoX, which assigns experts by function. FoXperts disentangles potential conflicts in mainstream modality-oriented designs and provides a solid foundation for CoT. When introducing CoT, the first question is how to design it for complex image generation. To this end, we emulate a human-like artistic workflow -- planning, acting, reflection, and correction -- and propose the Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) approach, as the data involves both text and image. To address the subsequent challenge -- designing an effective MCoT training paradigm -- we develop a multi-task joint training scheme that equips the model with all capabilities required for each MCoT step in a disentangled manner. This paradigm avoids the difficulty of collecting consistent multi-step data tuples. Extensive experiments show that FoX consistently outperforms existing unified models on various T2I benchmarks, delivering notable improvements in complex image generation.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01298","published_date":"2025-10-23T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-23T06:39:10.050870","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","preprints","cscv","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6a0c2a32a479","title":"Attri-Net: A Globally and Locally Inherently Interpretable Model for Multi","content":"arXiv:2406.05477v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for machine learning algorithms in high-stakes medical applications. However, high-performing neural networks typically cannot explain their predictions. Post-hoc explanation methods provide a way to understand neural networks but have been shown to suffer from conceptual problems. Moreover, current research largely focuses on providing local explanations for individual samples rather than global explanations for the model itself. In this paper, we propose Attri-Net, an inherently interpretable model for multi-label classification that provides local and global explanations. Attri-Net first counterfactually generates class-specific attribution maps to highlight the disease evidence, then performs classification with logistic regression classifiers based solely on the attribution maps. Local explanations for each prediction can be obtained by interpreting the attribution maps weighted by the classifiers' weights. Global explanation of whole model can be obtained by jointly considering learned average representations of the attribution maps for each class (called the class centers) and the weights of the linear classifiers. To ensure the model is ``right for the right reason\", we further introduce a mechanism to guide the model's explanations to align with human knowledge.

Com o feedback dos jogadores que participaram, os desenvolvedores já revelaram as primeiras mudanças que o modo terá, como melhorias nos mapas, veículos e mais. Review Battlefield 6 | Retorno da campanha não empolga, mas multiplayer brilha Impressões de um \"noob\": Black Ops 7 distancia quem não tem costume com frenesi Em uma publicação no X, o Battlefield Studios lembra que a primeira temporada chega nesta terça-feira, dia 28 de outubro, e apresentou o que está mudando no jogo base no futuro, como movimentação do jogador, progresso, experiência adquirida, mudanças nas classes e mais. Battle royale de Battlefield 6 passará por otimizações Para o modo battle royale de Battlefield 6, os desenvolvedores estão trabalhando ajustes no TTK (Time to Kill) em combate próximo com todas as armas. Além disso, os jogadores poderão carregar consigo duas placas de armaduras em uma partida. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- https://t.co/20nvBQGnTK — Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) October 24, 2025 Em relação ao mundo do modo de jogo, que ainda não conhecemos - já que o teste fechado aconteceu somente aos jogadores do hemisfério norte e nenhum material foi divulgado até agora - o Battlefield Studios está corrigindo bugs, ajustando iluminação e melhorando a visibilidade por todo o mapa. Por último, a promessa dos desenvolvedores é ajustes nos veículos, seja helicópteros ou aqueles terrestres. O mapa do modo battle royale é maior que os mapas padrões do jogo, e por isso, ele precisa de um cuidado diferente. Os desenvolvedores estão trabalhando para trazer uma \"performance fluída\" em geral. \"Identificamos e resolvemos uma série de problemas que afetavam o desempenho, o que simplesmente não teríamos conseguido sem a participação dos nossos jogadores nos testes\", descreve a publicação da EA. Durante os dias em que o novo modo passou por testes, diferentes vídeos de gameplay vazaram, dando um gostinho do que os jogadores podem esperar. Porém a maioria deles foi derrubada pela EA, já que se tratava de trechos que nem o próprio estúdio havia divulgado ainda. Enquanto os jogadores esperam pelo novo modo, que ainda não tem data para chegar, as novidades da primeira temporada devem saciar os fãs mais sedentos.

{"id":"arxiv_4beba755ea0c","title":"Knowledge","content":"The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a \"flooding-pruning\" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15074v1","published_date":"2025-11-19T03:27:14","collected_date":"2025-11-20T02:04:12.663317","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","csai","cscl","research_academic","research_academia"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.15074v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15074v1.pdf","authors":["Henrik Bradland","Morten Goodwin","Vladimir I.

This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric P\\\"oschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\\\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715","published_date":"2025-11-04T05:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-04T06:41:25.200482","language":"en","tags":["mathmp","mathematics","quant-ph","math-ph","research","preprints","hep-th","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":152,"author":"U.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_200e57e59ee3","title":"Revisiting Long","content":"arXiv:2510.05862v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens, that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05862","published_date":"2025-11-05T05:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-05T06:40:11.656313","language":"en","tags":["csai","research","computer-science","preprints","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs
