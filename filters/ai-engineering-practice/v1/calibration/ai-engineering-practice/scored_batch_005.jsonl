{"id":"science_biorxiv_92583917636f","title":"A splice","content":"Variants in ion channel genes are common causes of pediatric epilepsy, often leading to intractable seizures, developmental delay and other comorbidities, which increases risk of death. Pathogenic variants in the SCN8A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel critical for action potential generation in the brain, account for ~1% of genetic epilepsies. The voltage sensor in SCN8A domain 1 is encoded by one of two developmentally-regulated mutually exclusive alternative exons, 5N and 5A. We observe that variants in these exons are more likely to cause infantile spasms, a severe seizure type, than variants elsewhere in SCN8A, and that some pathogenic variants affect exon 5 splicing, impacting patient phenotype. Molecular and evolutionary analyses implicate the exon sequences of these and other voltage-gated ion channel alternative exons in splicing regulation. We identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that shift splicing of SCN8A exon 5N to 5A or vice versa. These ASOs normalize neuronal activity in patient-derived iPSC neurons, and reduce seizures and motor impairment and extend lifespan in a new exon 5N mutant mouse model. Our results demonstrate that splice-switching ASOs can effectively reduce the expression of pathogenic isoforms and rescue both seizure and non-seizure phenotypes. Similar approaches should be applicable to pediatric genetic epilepsies caused by mutations in other ion channel alternative exons.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.22.683934v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-22T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-23T06:40:14.347326","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":210,"author":"Dame, H.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_157176766e1c","title":"Demographic insights for coral restoration","content":"Coral reef decline has prompted a global surge in reef restoration initiatives. The success of initiatives that aim to sustain coral populations or assemblages will depend on demographic principles. Restoration strategies generally follow two demographic pathways: additive approaches, which increase population numbers by introducing recruits, fragments, or adults without altering vital rates; and multiplicative approaches, which enhance vital rates-growth, survival, or reproduction-either extrinsically (e.g., herbivory, habitat protection) or intrinsically (e.g., assisted evolution). We synthesized 34 coral matrix population models spanning morphologically diverse coral species from the Caribbean, Hawaii and the Great Barrier Reef, to quantify additive and multiplicative changes needed to increase population growth. Results highlight two consistent demographic leverage points for which population growth was most sensitive:(1) survival of reproductive adults and (2) successful recruitment. Achieving a 5% increase in population growth rate through additive means required ~100 recruit outplants or 5-10 adult outplants per 1,000 individuals in a population annually. For large populations typical of restoration targets (105-107 individuals), this translates to 103-104 outplants per year-efforts rarely logistically or economically feasible. By contrast, improving adult survival or recruitment rates by 20% (1.2 fold) produced equivalent population growth increases, depending on the fraction of the population affected. These findings yield two key implications. First, additive interventions are inefficient for large populations and demand sustained, large-scale effort. Second, strategies enhancing vital rates across broad population segments represent the most effective means of boosting coral abundance, including habitat protection, the alleviation of environmental stressors, and interventions which promote long-term survival and recruitment. Our demographic framework underscores that if the restoration goal is to enhance coral cover on a sustained basis, success depends less on adding individuals and more on interventions that will lead to long-term increases in vital rates.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.21.683544v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-22T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-23T06:40:14.345982","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":288,"author":"Madin, J.

{"id":"arxiv_33c030facb0c","title":"Dust back","content":"A nascent planet in a gas disk experiences radial migration due to the different torques which act on it. It has recently been shown that the torques produced by the gas and dust density variations around a non-accreting low-mass planet, the so-called cold thermal and dust streaming torques, can surpass each of the other torque components. We investigate how the total torque acting on the planet is affected by the presence of dust grains and their aerodynamic back-reaction on gas, while taking into account the cold thermal torque produced by thermal diffusion in the gas component. We perform high-resolution local and global three-dimensional two-fluid simulations within the pressureless-fluid dust approximation using the Fargo3D code. We explore the influence of different dust species parameterized by the Stokes number, focusing on non-accreting protoplanets with masses from one-third the mass of Mars to one Earth mass. The dust feedback has substantial impact on the asymmetry of the cold thermal lobes (which produce the cold thermal torque). However, the total torque is dominated by the dust torque when St $>10^{-2}$. The dust torque becomes more negative over time due to the formation of dust lobes that resemble the cold thermal lobes that form in the gas component. Therefore, the dust streaming torque prevails over the cold thermal torque. On the other hand, when St $\\leq10^{-2}$, the dust streaming torque is negligible and thus, the total torque on the planet comes from the gaseous component of the disk. Our results suggest that a planet embedded in a gas-dust disk may experience stagnant migration or inward runaway migration in regions of the protoplanetary disk where the dust is not fully coupled to the gas. However, this behaviour could change in regions with strong dust-gas coupling or in the inner transition region of the disk, where the cold thermal torque may become relevant.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01973v1","published_date":"2025-11-03T19:00:01","collected_date":"2025-11-05T07:27:27.864818","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","astro-phep","engineering","engineering_systems"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.01973v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01973v1.pdf","authors":["Raúl O.

{"id":"arxiv_58cd18bc3316","title":"Collateral Damage Assessment Model for AI System Target Engagement in Military Operations","content":"In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20337v1","published_date":"2025-10-23T08:36:04","collected_date":"2025-10-25T06:43:37.739428","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","csai"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.20337v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20337v1.pdf","authors":["Clara

{"id":"science_arxiv_eess_eeb8bc147182","title":"Low","content":"arXiv:2511.16260v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers have been seen as novel radio frequency measurements and the high sensitivity to a large range of frequencies makes it attractive for communications reception. However, current implementations of Rydberg array antennas predominantly rely on simple stacking of multiple single-antenna units. While conceptually straightforward, this approach leads to substantial system bulkiness due to the unique requirements of atomic sensors, particularly the need for multiple spatially separated laser setups, rendering such designs both impractical for real-world applications and challenging to fabricate. This limitation underscores the critical need for developing multiplexed Rydberg sensor array architectures. In the domain of conventional RF array antennas, hybrid analog-digital beamforming has emerged as a pivotal architecture for large-scale millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as it substantially reduces the hardware complexity associated with fully-digital beamforming while closely approaching its performance. Drawing inspiration from this methodology, we conduct a systematic study in this work on the design principles, equivalent modeling, and precoding strategies for low-complexity multiplexed Rydberg array, an endeavor crucial to enabling practical and scalable quantum-enhanced communication systems.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16260","published_date":"2025-11-21T05:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-21T06:42:37.917214","language":"en","tags":["research","eesssp","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess

{"id":"science_arxiv_eess_089d287358c7","title":"Selection and Stability of Functional Connectivity Features for Classification of Brain Disorders","content":"arXiv:2511.05531v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Brain disorders are an umbrella term for a group of neurological and psychiatric conditions that have a major effect on thinking, feeling, and acting. These conditions encompass a wide range of conditions. The illnesses in question pose significant difficulties not only for individuals, but also for healthcare systems all across the world. In this study, we explore the capability of explainable machine learning for classification of people who suffer from brain disorders. This is accomplished by the utilization of brain connection map, also referred as connectome, derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In order to analyze features that are based on the connectome, we investigated several different feature selection procedures. These strategies included the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Relief, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), in addition to a logistic regression (LR) classifier. First and foremost, the purpose was to evaluate and contrast the classification accuracy of different feature selection methods in terms of distinguishing healthy controls from diseased individuals. The evaluation of the stability of the traits that were chosen was the second objective. The identification of the regions of the brain that have an effect on the classification was the third main objective. When applied to the UCLA dataset, the LASSO approach, which is our most effective strategy, produced a classification accuracy of 91.85% and a stability index of 0.74, which is greater than the results obtained by other approaches: Relief and ANOVA. These methods are effective in locating trustworthy biomarkers, which adds to the development of connectome-based classification in the context of issues that impact the brain.","source":"science_arxiv_eess","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05531","published_date":"2025-11-11T05:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-11T06:41:25.447691","language":"en","tags":["q-bionc","research","eessiv","systems","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"eess
