{"id":"science_biorxiv_e7854a6342be","title":"Adipocyte IL","content":"Interleukin (IL)22 has been shown to play an important role in intestinal host defense and ameliorating high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic disorders primarily through signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Adipocytes have emerged as key immune metabolic regulators that influence intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the role of IL-22RA1 signaling in adipocytes has not been explored. In the present study, we examined the role of IL22RA1 signaling in adipocytes in response to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mediated gut inflammation. To do this, we subjected adipocyte specific Il22ra1 knockout mice (Il22ra1Adipo) to intestinal inflammation under normal chow and HFD conditions. Compared to littermate controls, Il22ra1Adipo mice displayed significant weight loss on day 9 of DSS treatment and showed altered expression of immune response and lipid metabolism related genes in white adipose tissue (WAT) under a normal chow diet. Notably, when mice were primed with HFD prior to DSS induced intestinal injury, WAT from Il22ra1Adipo mice showed a significant reduction in Fabp4 expression and a marked increase in the proliferation marker Ki67. These findings indicate that loss of IL22RA1 signaling in adipocytes disrupts adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, leading to increased proliferation of preadipocytes or stromal cells without proper maturation. Importantly, this altered adipose tissue response occurred despite similar levels of colonic inflammation between knockout and control mice, suggesting a critical role for adipocyte IL22RA1 signaling in maintaining metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis in WAT during combined metabolic and intestinal inflammatory stress.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.14.688505v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-11-16T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-17T01:59:42.351117","language":"en","tags":["cutting-edge","preprints","life-sciences","biology","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv Subject Collection: All","source_category":"science","word_count":241,"author":"Singh, A., Shiomitsu, K., Gaudino, S.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_6f14360ccf9e","title":"The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs","content":"arXiv:2510.13786v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786","published_date":"2025-10-16T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-16T06:40:33.792268","language":"en","tags":["cslg","csai","research","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":205,"author":"Devvrit Khatri, Lovish Madaan, Rishabh Tiwari, Rachit Bansal, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Manzil Zaheer, Inderjit S.

We show that definitions in terms of local patterns, containment in ultra(co)products, and continuous model theory are all equivalent, just as in ergodic theory. And, for actions on Cantor space, we show these are all equivalent to approximate conjugacy. Restricting our attention to Cantor space, we connect this theory to questions about generic actions. We show how the shape of the space of weak equivalence classes reflects the geometry of the acting group. And, we show that, for $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, there is no smallest limit of finite actions.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10882","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:40:22.271999","language":"en","tags":["mathds","preprints","research","mathematics","mathlo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":111,"author":"Riley Thornton","raw_content_length":704,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.555,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["ultra(co)products","Cantor","Elek"],"persons":["Zucker"],"locations":[],"monetary":["$\\mathbb{Z}^2$"]},"char_count":701,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Topological weak containment","Cantor space","arXiv251010882v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","work","Elek","Zucker","a topological analogue","the theory","weak containment"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Topological weak containment","work"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Topological weak containment":2.0,"Cantor space":2.0,"arXiv251010882v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"work":1.0,"Elek":1.0,"Zucker":1.0,"a topological analogue":1.0,"the theory":1.0,"weak containment":1.0}},"age_hours":2.785486186111111,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.937,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8126,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.923,"joy":0.0137,"surprise":0.0356,"sadness":0.0035,"fear":0.0031,"anger":0.0138,"disgust":0.0073},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of AI in software development, mentioning the integration of AI tools into the development process.

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_21212cc47583","title":"Thailand levert beruchte gokmagnaat uit aan China","content":"Thailand heeft een beruchte Chinese gokmagnaat uitgeleverd aan China. De man, She Zhijiang, wordt onder meer verdacht van het runnen van illegale online gok- en oplichtingspraktijken vanuit Myanmar. Het Chinese staatspersbureau Xinhua meldt dat She inmiddels is geland in de Chinese stad Nanjing. China probeert de 43-jarige She al jaren in handen te krijgen. In 2014 vaardigden de Chinese autoriteiten een internationaal arrestatiebevel uit voor hem. Drie jaar geleden werd hij vanwege dat bevel opgepakt in de Thaise hoofdstad Bangkok. Daarna begon er een uitleveringsprocedure. Daar kwam begin deze week een einde aan, toen een Thaise rechter ook in hoger beroep groen licht gaf voor de uitlevering. Tegenover persbureau Reuters noemt de advocaat van She het uitleveringsproces \"ongebruikelijk\", zonder daar verder op in te gaan. Verder zegt zijn cliënt niets fout te hebben gedaan. De uitlevering van She komt in de week waarin de Thaise koning afreist naar China. Hij kwam vandaag aan in het land voor het eerste staatsbezoek ooit van een zittende Thaise monarch aan China. Scam farms De BBC schrijft dat She begin jaren tachtig werd geboren in een arm dorp in de Chinese provincie Hunan. Hij ging als 14-jarige van school en leerde vervolgens programmeren. Als jonge twintiger trok hij naar de Filipijnen, waar hij kennismaakte met de online gokindustrie, die illegaal is in China. Hij runde zijn imperium vanuit Shwe Kokko, een stad in Myanmar gebouwd tegen de Thaise grens. De stad is berucht om zijn link met illegale gokpraktijken, mensenhandel en cybercrime. Criminelen hebben er vrij spel, omdat de junta in het afgelegen en door de burgeroorlog verscheurd gebied nauwelijks tot geen zeggenschap heeft. Eerder dit jaar werden er nog honderden buitenlanders bevrijd uit zogenoemde scam farms in Myanmar, die onder dwang van bendes internetgebruikers moesten oplichten. En in september werden elf mensen van een oplichtersfamilie ter dood veroordeeld in China om soortgelijke praktijken, die ze runden vanuit een andere Myanmarese grensstad. She wordt door de Chinese autoriteiten onder meer verdacht van het runnen van illegale casino's en goksites, waar in totaal bijna 400 miljoen dollar op rondging. Ook zou hij 248 oplichtersbendes hebben gefaciliteerd, die het via online fraude hadden gemunt op Chinese burgers. Het VN-bureau dat zich bezighoudt met de strijd tegen drugs en criminaliteit noemde She in 2014 ook al eens in een rapport. Hij werd daarin omschreven als iemand met een flinke invloed in tal van sectoren in Zuidoost-Azië - uiteenlopend van vastgoed en bouw tot entertainment - en dan in het bijzonder in Cambodja, Myanmar, Thailand en de Filipijnen. De geboren Chinees heeft ook een Myanmarees en Cambodjaans paspoort. In september legde de VS nog sancties op aan She vanwege zijn rol in de illegale gokindustrie en oplichterscentra. Zo zoomt het Amerikaanse ministerie van Financiën in een persbericht in op een project van She in Shwe Kokko, waar in acht jaar tijd voor miljarden in is geïnvesteerd en het ene na het andere gebouw uit de grond is gestampt. Daarmee moeten onder meer toeristen worden getrokken, maar in werkelijkheid zou het vooral een dekmantel zijn om criminele activiteiten te verhullen. \"Oplichtersbendes hebben mensen onder valse voorwendselen gelokt, om ze vervolgens vast te zetten, ze fysiek te mishandelen en ze te dwingen voor criminelen te werken als online scammers\", zo staat in het persbericht. \"Ontsnapte slachtoffers zeggen dat ze zijn vastgehouden, tot er losgeld is betaald door hun families. Ook werden ze geslagen als ze doelen niet haalden en gedwongen om sekswerk te verrichten.\" Zuidoost-Azië-correspondent Mustafa Marghadi sprak eerder dit jaar met slachtoffers van oplichtersbendes,

When $\\mathcal{R}$ consists of contractive representations, we show that $F_\\mathcal{R}(G,A,\\alpha, \\sigma)$ is a Banach algebra with a contractive approximate identity, which can also be characterized by an isometric universal property. As an application, we specialize to the $L^p$-operator algebra setting, defining both the $L^p$-twisted crossed product and the reduced version. Finally, we give a generalization of the so-called Packer-Raeburn trick to the $L^p$-setting, showing that any $L^p$-twisted crossed product is \"stably\" isometrically isomorphic to an untwisted one.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24106","published_date":"2025-10-10T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-10T06:41:56.616916","language":"en","tags":["mathfa","mathematics","preprints","mathoa","research","mathds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":128,"author":"Alonso Delf\\'in, Carla Farsi, Judith Packer","raw_content_length":962,"priority":8,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.64,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Packer-Raeburn"],"persons":["Banach"],"locations":[],"monetary":["L^p$-twisted","F_\\mathcal{R}(G"]},"char_count":959,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["products","Banach algebras","Announce Type","Abstract","a locally compact group","a nondegenerate Banach algebra","a contractive approximate identity","a twisted action","alpha","a family mathcalR"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"products":2.0,"Banach algebras":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"Abstract":1.0,"a locally compact group":1.0,"a nondegenerate Banach algebra":1.0,"a contractive approximate identity":1.0,"a twisted action":1.0,"alpha":1.0,"a family mathcalR":1.0}},"age_hours":2.796013515277778,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8974,"joy":0.0194,"surprise":0.0589,"sadness":0.0048,"fear":0.0024,"anger":0.0122,"disgust":0.0048},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":6.0,"evidence":"The article describes the use of AI in software development workflows, mentioning the use of AI coding assistants.
