Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17621","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:11:07.934346","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscr","preprints","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"community_social_programming_reddit_850083fe1d42","title":"LogMod: What if C had a logging framework with modern semantics?","content":"In my own experience when looking into C logging libraries, I found that they either rely on hidden global state or quietly calls malloc behind the scenes. In environments where you need deterministic memory usage and explicit control over resources, that’s problematic. I wanted to see if it was possible to bring more “modern” logging semantics - things like configurable contexts, custom labels, colour coding, callbacks and thread‐safety - into plain ANSI C without using dynamic memory or preprocessor magic. (it is possible!) LogMod is the result. It’s a single‑header library that lets you initialise a logging context with a fixed table of loggers, pass that context around instead of using globals, define your own severity levels and colours, hook in custom callbacks, and even make it thread‑safe with a user‑supplied lock. It avoids malloc entirely. The challenge was fitting all of this into a few hundred lines of portable code and retaining C’s “zero-overhead” philosophy. submitted by /u/LucasMull [link] [comments]","source":"community_social_programming_reddit","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1oc2h8k/logmod_what_if_c_had_a_logging_framework_with/","published_date":"2025-10-21T03:32:02","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:14:18.253556","language":"en","tags":["community","reddit","programming","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"programming","source_category":"community_social","word_count":161,"author":"/u/LucasMull","raw_content_length":1394,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.805,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LogMod"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1031,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["LogMod","a logging framework","modern semantics","my own experience","C logging libraries","hidden global state","malloc","the scenes","environments","you"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"LogMod":2.0,"a logging framework":2.0,"modern semantics":2.0,"my own experience":1.0,"C logging libraries":1.0,"hidden global state":1.0,"malloc":1.0,"the scenes":1.0,"environments":1.0,"you":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7904275816666666,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"ac5637f6f928d0e01d0292893340ccf0","title_md5":"81bd04d535e62e71ef3f20a6fd67145d","url_normalized":"e295402616f0f6c33f1473b94402118d","minhash_signature":["24908679","14312","14366","13560711","498956","7901950","4626937","2181150","1062486","193463","13561458","14244073","2343024","17795633","953500","5696696","14171223","16169502","497505","955784","1196901","88593","1386815","13461341","1559207","972898","7507083","16205262","8348822","8720670","16281514","2260580","4511764","2820767","4592086","23886555","684203","6218001","309467","11762562","2394106","6844064","29531799","192048","6374280","12465832","646834","23451935","1132398","8172648","334797","843096","9230480","3018416","136855","5348354","2780349","2884394","7700446","1151625","4677246","19074674","6578137","5603612","7601","3789593","9932183","3235713","9773169","4625726","4258427","1755940","4090701","4528274","7951082","2595826","4590079","6134367","407005","13132689","301782","1969868","3972917","8572837","442394","2202200","29680147","2033222","9749104","8318141","12039710","2175767","19499623","436779","17812399","2999489","1608076","479007","23503488","8732205","28938938","3028635","12264772","959807","6645887","4255067","6409355","2946257","13734988","44001","1264329","7086138","2377063","10649024","9652365","691352","873230","13762129","1592955","5147722","1131087","14106334","952385","1331506","15152023","1376388","1742731","5198470"],"title_minhash":["44669188","56763205","29733381","36752328","6697520","48488295","45387822","45211171","41359210","11080308","4721759","14244073","20573759","13957442","16595777","33230074","98422007","4282388","73729706","100851109","1196901","22480475","49184643","2113985","8492544","112624634","7507083","121151449","68825257","69853554","301901712","240271315","25190055","91141172","31118940","122657503","51437858","133689938","24166357","101238272","89288249","6844064","34242237","50823600","75692856","93884644","8543539","45567103","13467521","46572762","58851722","8355167","22471672","56267700","136855","56121544","58631771","265837699","155780493","128055914","116114321","46986075","38275179","9364271","33054835","16611414","9862989","43622336","32471428","16095619","230562625","83788643","15056664","65103815","89446203","34397805","95351823","161988703","96705675","59760279","1273402","238623514","76621880","40067512","11399451","26426332","87380012","290403399","36523646","8661640","74938439","33403120","28682820","82247572","13402462","132970388","1608076","226158198","11483721","37705172","185122831","66992058","14554737","29792790","23272788","55561993","46213269","124541098","40761208","12196566","4034866","22532271","49854310","29581038","27271784","66130200","926978","34339187","48385339","22717768","35233040","111756460","52264841","128771503","25518271","32920017","96187333","63805135"],"combined_hash":"87f2e610fd558b64c9c181bc89158598"},"sentiment_score":4.4864999999999995,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1027,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8465,"joy":0.0016,"surprise":0.0235,"sadness":0.0081,"fear":0.0153,"anger":0.032,"disgust":0.073},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":3.0,"evidence":"The article mentions the use of AI in software development but lacks specific details about the workflows involved.

{"id":"science_biorxiv_84cd43f83022","title":"Recruitment of the outer-membrane lipoprotein DolP to thedivision site via cardiolipin","content":"In diderm bacteria, the outer membrane (OM) must invaginate in step with septal peptidoglycan (PG) remodeling during cytokinesis. One OM lipoprotein, DolP, has been shown to localize at the cell division site and to facilitate the daughter cell separation. Yet how DolP is recruited to the division site remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, we show that DolP arrives concomitantly with the late divisome protein FtsN. Utilizing single-particle tracking Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (spt-PALM), we investigated the dynamics of individual DolP molecules in living Escherichia coli cells. Single-molecule analysis revealed two diffusion states: a diffusive state across the cell envelope and a previously underappreciated immobile state enriched at the septal and polar regions. Importantly, DolP does not comigrate with the processive FtsW-FtsI-FtsN complex. Mutations of the cardiolipin-binding surface caused loss of mid-cell enrichment and reduced the immobile fraction. Cardiolipin's preference for high negative curvature enriches it at the division site, creating a trapping environment for DolP. Additionally, the active septal constriction but not the late divisome proteins recruit DolP. Together, these findings indicate that cardiolipin-mediated immobilization underlies DolP's septal enrichment.","source":"science_biorxiv","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.29.685289v1?rss=1","published_date":"2025-10-29T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-30T06:39:48.173899","language":"en","tags":["life-sciences","preprints","biology","cutting-edge","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"bioRxiv

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_67cb715a70d0","title":"American footballcoach uit Netflix","content":"Een American footballcoach die een prominente rol speelde in de Netflix-serie Last Chance U is doodgeschoten op de campus van de hogeschool waar hij werkte. Dat meldt de politie van de stad Oakland, in de Amerikaanse staat Californië. De 66-jarige John Beam werd donderdag neergeschoten. Hij overleed een dag later in het ziekenhuis. Er is niet veel informatie gedeeld over de schutter, behalve dat het gaat om een 27-jarige man die Beam kende en inmiddels is opgepakt. \"Dit was een zeer gericht incident\", zei een woordvoerder van de politie. Beam figureerde met zijn American footballteam van Laney College in het vijfde en laatste seizoen van Last Chance U, dat in 2020 op Netflix verscheen. Alom gewaardeerd De documentaireserie draait om studentensporters die aan lager wal zijn geraakt of op andere manieren met problemen kampen, en via sport hun leven weer op de rit proberen te krijgen. Beam toont zich in de serie als een coach die inzet op spelers die door anderen al zijn afgewezen, en zo een innige band opbouwde met zijn team. In Oakland werd Beam alom gewaardeerd. Toen Beam nog vocht voor zijn leven, kwamen mensen naar het ziekenhuis om voor hem te bidden. Hij was ruim veertig jaar coach. Burgemeester van Oakland Barbara Lee omschreef Beam als \"een reus\" van de stad, die in zijn leven mentor was voor duizenden jongeren, \"en zo de jeugd van Oakland de beste kans op succes gaf\". Lee: \"In meer dan veertig jaar heeft hij leiders gecreëerd, op en naast het veld, en onze gemeenschap is samen met zijn familie geschokt\". Twee broers die Beam coachte en die op dit moment spelen in topcompetitie NFL spelen, reageerden op Instagram verslagen op zijn dood. \"Je betekent alles voor mij\", schreef Rejzohn Wright, speler van New Orleans Saints. Nahshon Wright, die speelt bij Chicago Bears, plaatste een video van hem en Beam uit een aflevering van Last Chance U.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2590531","published_date":"2025-11-15T02:44:22","collected_date":"2025-11-15T06:37:26.675355","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":317,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2015,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.585,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Netflix-serie Last Chance"],"persons":["Netflix","American","Chance U","John Beam"],"locations":["stad Oakland","Last","Laney","Californië"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1874,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["American","Een American","die","een prominente rol","Last","de campus","de hogeschool","hij","Dat","de politie"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"American":2.0,"Een American":1.0,"die":1.0,"een prominente rol":1.0,"Last":1.0,"de campus":1.0,"de hogeschool":1.0,"hij":1.0,"Dat":1.0,"de politie":1.0}},"age_hours":4.542600391944444,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"accf644b73b0d026c9e0a5ee1311b9e1","title_md5":"205e8aa43d282045ec251477309c0426","url_normalized":"32d440d69d5493d4aa16c04495e4f2ed","minhash_signature":["16879961","8255351","14366","19767831","6697520","11221577","23707653","1684313","294957","11743625","11895153","2763186","1217305","5950415","953500","56890","2138553","1929019","9722371","12273043","2582010","3581949","459618","3483270","6284996","1882961","10291414","5225880","21259947","8720670","3290860","2260580","2518573","9969046","1090859","14090067","5241720","6362267","309467","11762562","2394106","5626664","15825083","195857","907738","2463753","1691750","1443639","797714","3467375","4388659","8355167","5647154","214699","7792534","1909511","5846846","7750562","4430687","1151625","4334793","7144066","6372115","19144598","7601","3789593","2940560","1563117","8158384","14942709","5786666","2440745","13077413","4528274","5095515","2595826","269839","2433691","11560535","5233235","9188394","4072191","1292529","8727416","11728217","2202200","1021764","842875","2840755","12144713","343266","2275865","8261531","1138237","1182542","5229812","2811152","479007","13963853","5834464","4227644","780514","3331841","7495224","129586","3376316","6419416","2447857","6462857","44001","5849234","85694","1550051","4438756","756656","2786430","873230","1307835","1203073","5757197","6123858","9876597","1129826","3448143","15152023","809487","9098556","5198470"],"title_minhash":["189273155","412445671","19481487","32421658","82548586","71468168","168912952","100162177","2645416","91793396","155522442","177599455","512903593","61763053","17352757","70742062","215857950","211775671","111538873","12273043","90588995","137349785","18948283","120171144","44720605","85938400","15571883","95694796","373930110","335689471","13704350","86730806","65017935","43743547","55709194","445172191","15898242","213799053","11403421","576022424","108687630","246557543","41147019","330026414","39996494","274815204","131553920","167470420","104568449","46144304","158167938","10030682","228566070","214699","419279882","84430370","7015836","25481668","165756939","102627154","9455544","26211663","283181948","261786096","623882","515025806","97202405","89774653","126461038","136221634","36457670","235345887","75422428","132323249","20836514","264107386","87378943","135715989","261505482","117263814","1246369","96244694","148204555","95860172","124021149","103241684","94416321","224412518","319351234","319852837","7678043","340244463","145888994","16277282","49453443","298399843","270613805","541395872","60438428","7840644","480086281","780514","58135004","136860152","54728798","122906386","92590664","172275614","13734988","12196566","148715462","12224548","329952866","159779077","64550336","49510724","57870185","36725984","66788360","267846362","64282215","73533758","39755444","199030899","394341062","215054736","118513040","284126137"],"combined_hash":"ee577f8017708c6996c1d4768d74202d"},"sentiment_score":1.1085,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.7783,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8344,"joy":0.0088,"surprise":0.0722,"sadness":0.0216,"fear":0.0205,"anger":0.0264,"disgust":0.016},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":6.0,"evidence":"The paper mentions using AI tools for code generation and testing, but the workflow is described at a general level.

{"id":"arxiv_796a42a5d9c4","title":"TRACE: Textual Reasoning for Affordance Coordinate Extraction","content":"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions into the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance Coordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of Reasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology to create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous pipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By fine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial reasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary Where2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more challenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that performance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming the CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps reveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically across reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a textual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision, reliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control.

But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior. In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets (especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features. Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18256","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.159673","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

In this paper, we establish a model based on both Kubelka-Munk theory and Mie theory that links the absorption and scattering properties of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of its thin-film composite, supported by detailed experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. By using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are extracted from the measured transmittance and reflectance. On the other hand, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the sum of absorption and scattering cross-sections of individual particles, which are calculated from the Mie theory specified for particles in an absorbing medium, with the scattering $S$ coefficient further modulated by the anisotropy factor $g$. The effect of the particulate medium is incorporated through an effective refractive index. The overall model is validated by matching well between the $K-S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and theoretical calculations. This agreement provides deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. The validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain preliminary results for materials designed in a number of applications, such as radiative cooling.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248","published_date":"2025-11-18T05:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-18T06:41:59.074226","language":"en","tags":["research","physicsoptics","physics","physicsapp-ph","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":258,"author":"Thi Hong Pham, Nguyen Trung Kien, Nguyen Viet Tuyen, Hung Q.
