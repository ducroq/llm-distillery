{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_b1aac04e6bed", "title": "Agentic AI isn’t always the answer", "content": "When it comes to agentic artificial intelligence, the fear of missing out factor is clear. Organizations are plopping down agents, in part, because that’s what everyone else seems to be doing. But FOMO is not a business strategy. To make agentic AI work, business leaders need to ignore the hype and concentrate on establishing exactly what agents can do for them, how, and at what cost. Our own work has proved that AI agents, which independently plan and execute complex multistep tasks, can deliver substantial value by accelerating timelines and reducing costs. And that is just the start. The ever-improving ability of AI agents to work with people to plan, communicate, and learn, could evolve into a genuine paradigm shift in how business is done. Unclear business value But enthusiasm does not always translate into impact, something that many businesses are beginning to recognize. According to one study, 40% of agentic AI projects could be canceled by the end of 2027 due to unclear business value and escalating costs. In recent research, McKinsey studied dozens of agentic AI initiatives, including 50 in which we were directly involved. With the wisdom of hindsight, we’ve identified three critical factors in agentic AI success. 1. Start with workflows, not agents Agentic transformations are more likely to succeed when they focus on integrating agents into reimagined workflows, rather than tacking agents onto processes designed for another technological era. And the corollary is also true: even the most powerful AI agent will underperform if it is tethered to faulty and inefficient workflows. Already, agents are being successfully deployed in multi-step, dynamic workflows like IT help desks, software development, and customer service. The boldest leaders are also successfully deploying agents to frontier use cases. For example, an alternative legal services provider found substantial efficiency gains when it carefully modernized its contract review process. Every time a lawyer made a change in the document editor, it was logged, categorized, and fed back into the agent’s logic and knowledge base. In designing the agentic workflow, the team identified where, when, and how to integrate human input. Agents highlighted edge cases and anomalies for people to review. Over time, the agents were able to codify new expertise and provide more sophisticated legal reasoning, but it was up to the lawyers to sign off on critical decisions. 2. Stop the slop Many enthusiastic early adopters built agents whose outputs have become known as “slop”—that is, work that may be done quickly but then requires considerable effort to correct. This is annoying. Worse, it breeds distrust in the agents and in the idea of transformation more generally. To do better, companies should invest in agents just as systematically as they do in people, with managers, job descriptions, training, monitoring, and continuous development goals. 3. To support AI agents, engage the workforce It should be humans who onboard, train, and evaluate agents on an ongoing basis: “launch and leave” is not good enough. As agents begin to accomplish more, roles will shift. Leaders will need to train employees in a new human-agent hybrid operating model, including skills such as building and deploying agents effectively, training them, setting tasks for them, tracking and correcting their work, and stringing them together to perform more complex tasks. The essential principle is that agentic AI needs to work with, not against, time-honored business priorities like productivity and teamwork. The question, then, is not whether to deploy agents, as with any other technology, it is when can they help to solve real-world problems and create value? And the answer is: not always. For tasks related to parsing lengthy documents, generative AI applications such as chatbots are probably the better option. For highly structured or automated tasks like data entry, rules-based approaches—if x, then y—can be more efficient. And high-stakes decisions with little room for error are the domain of leaders and managers. Yes, agentic AI could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity—thus the FOMO effect. Success will come not from enthusiasm, however, but from a hard-headed analysis of how this tool can be used wisely—for the right task, at the right time.", "source":

{"id": "community_social_reddit_machine_learning_9f162f1f7e42", "title": "My experience deploying an ML", "content": "Years back, after finishing my CS degree, I got into algorithmic trading as a personal project. It felt like the perfect arena to push my skills in coding, data science, and, most importantly, data engineering. After a long road of development, I recently deployed my first fully automated, ML-driven system. The trading results aren't the point of this post. I'm here to talk about the steps I've taken to solve the fundamental problem of getting a machine learning model to perform in a live environment exactly as it did during historical testing. A live production environment is hostile to determinism. Unlike a sterile backtest where all data is known, a live system deals with a relentless, ordered stream of events. This introduces two critical failure modes: Lookahead Bias: The risk of accidentally using information from the future to make a decision in the past. A live system must be architected to be a strict \"tape reader,\" ensuring it only ever acts on information that has already occurred. State Drift: A more insidious problem where the system's internal \"memory\"‚Äîits representation of the world, built from the stream of incoming data‚Äîslowly but surely drifts away from the ground truth of the historical environment. The live model ends up seeing a distorted reality compared to the one it was trained on, rendering its predictions meaningless. It's important to note that training a model on features containing lookahead bias will often cause state drift, but not all state drift is caused by lookahead bias. My entire development process was engineered to prevent both. My first principle was to enforce a strict, row-by-row processing model for all historical data. There are countless ways lookahead bias can creep into a feature engineering pipeline, but the most tempting source I found was from trying to optimize for performance. Using vectorized pandas operations or multi-threading is standard practice, but for a stateful, sequential problem, it's a minefield. While I'm sure there are pandas wizards who can vectorize my preprocessing without causing leaks, I'm not one of them. I chose to make a deliberate trade-off: I sacrificed raw performance for provable correctness. My solution is a \"golden master\" script that uses the exact same stateful classes the live bot will use. It feeds the entire historical dataset through these classes one row at a time, simulating a live \"tape reader.\" At the end of its run, it saves the final state of every component into a single file. While this is much slower than a vectorized approach, it's the cornerstone of the system's determinism. The live bot's startup process is now brutally simple: it loads the state file from the golden master. It doesn't build its own state; it restores it. It only has to process the short data gap between the end of the golden master's run and the current moment. This makes the live system easier to debug and guarantees a perfect, deterministic handover from the historical environment. Finally, I have the validator. This tool also starts from the same \"golden master\" state and re-processes the exact same raw data the live bot saw during its run. The goal is a Pearson correlation of 1.0 between the live bot's predictions and the validator's predictions. Anything less than a perfect correlation indicates a logical divergence that must be found and fixed. This project has been an incredible learning experience, but the biggest lesson was in humility. The most complex challenges weren't in model architecture but in the meticulous data engineering required to create a provably consistent bridge between the historical and the live environments. While my actual trading models are private, I have a lower-frequency version of the system that posts market updates and predictions. After running live for over three weeks, it maintained a >0.9999 correlation with its validator - shown in the attached picture. It's currently offline for some upgrades but will be back online in a few days. You can see it here: https://x.com/ZtenlEssej Thanks for reading.

{"id": "ai_ai_alignment_forum_82b83ba2145d", "title": "Rogue internal deployments via external APIs", "content": "Published on October 15, 2025 7:34 PM GMTtl;dr: A heavily-monitored internally deployed AI with sensitive access (e.g. to model weights) could bypass safety controls by asking a weakly-monitored external API version of itself (or another AI) what to do. It could then use its privileged access to execute instructions that the external API generated under less monitoring.Once AI companies build powerful AIs, they may:Give internal AIs access to sensitive internal privileges (e.g. access to the internal infra that touches model weights, help with training of the next generation of AIs, …);Have mitigations specific to those internal deployments enforced via monitoring of the internal LLM API;Have an external API deployment without those mitigations.In this situation, an internal AI may build an agent scaffold that makes calls to the external API and uses the internal sensitive privileges. Such agent scaffold would be in a better position to cause a catastrophe because it would not be subject to the same monitoring as the internal API. I call this a rogue internal deployment via external APIs. (It is “internal” because the model weights and the agent scaffold never leave the cluster.)I think preventing those is similarly important from a misalignment perspective as preventing LLM weight exfiltration (aka rogue external deployments) or regular rogue internal deployments where the AI hacks its own datacenter to run unmonitored LLM inference.This post explores this threat as well as potential mitigations. Overall, I think this is a threat that is relatively hard to mitigate. It is potentially a central example of a threat that probably requires fancy control measures (not “just trusted monitoring” or “just security”, probably a combination of trusted monitoring with some dedicated security measures, or something that fully leverages untrusted monitoring).Rogue internal deployments via external APIsLet’s say a scheming superhuman AI researcher (SAIR) is running inside OpenMind, and OpenMind is monitoring its actions via a monitor looking at all the traffic that goes through the internal API. Some human and a lot of AI labor is spent ensuring that no SAIR generation that goes out of the internal API would sabotage the security of OpenMind or the alignment of the next generation of AIs.But in contrast to AI2027, let’s imagine that the SAIR is also deployed externally not long after it started being deployed internally. The versions deployed externally are not used to modify the infra or align the next generation of OpenMind AIs but they are also less carefully monitored (more on why in “Monitoring the external API”).In such a situation, a scheming SAIR running internally (on the internal API, with internal permissions) could spin up an internal job with sensitive internal permissions that makes queries to OpenMind’s external API (more on why it may have access to it in “Preventing access to external APIs”) and executes the actions suggested by the external API.The internal SAIR also makes sure that in the prompt sent to the external SAIR there is enough information for the external SAIR to understand the situation. And now you have a situation where a barely-monitored external SAIR can write code and misleading research proposals that will be executed and acted on using the sensitive internal privileges of OpenMind - aka the SAIR successfully set up a rogue deployment!A variation: rogue internal deployments via cross-company APIsNote that this might be a concern even if OpenMind doesn’t have an external API, as long as another AI company (e.g DeepCent) has an external API that serves a frontier scheming model. In this case, instead of sending queries to the external OpenMind API, OpenMind’s SAIR could send queries to the DeepCent API.While AI companies might try to prevent this just to avoid sending their secrets to their competitors, I don’t think this means this problem will be solved by default.It does make the situation better that OpenMind AIs have much fewer plausible reasons to interact with DeepCent’s API than OpenMind’s API, but because DeepCent (and other actors that can wrap OpenMind or DeepCent’s API) might want to access OpenMind’s secrets, it means that scheming AIs might get a lot of help from outsiders setting up a scaffold that sends requests to an external LLM API. A possible mitigation: preventing the creation of scaffolds that use external LLM APIs via monitoringThe intervention that seems most promising to me is to monitor the code that internal AIs write and block attempts at creating code that both accesses sensitive internal permissions and gives LLMs accessed via external APIs the ability to interact at length with sensitive internal permissions.A variant of this could be to plug the monitoring and the control interventions in the agent scaffolds and the PR review system and use monitoring to ensure modification to these systems don’t unplug the monitor (and don’t redirect them to a less trusted LLM API).This monitoring task can be somewhat difficult, but I am hopeful that certain security measures can help monitors do a decent job at this. For example:With the right permissions, you could reduce the amount of generated code with both internet access and sensitive internal permissions, which helps focus monitoring efforts in the right place and reduce the effects of false positives elsewhere;With enough API-key hygiene, you could make it difficult for an internal scaffold (with sensitive internal permissions and internet access) to find external LLM API keys “by accident” (and actively looking for them would be more suspicious).This is not as effective when the LLM gets help from outside attackers that are trying to get AI company secrets since such attacker-provided endpoints might not even need API keys, but getting the instructions on how to access such external help might also be blatantly bad to a monitor. While this prevents direct code/research agent sabotage, it does not prevent things like the external LLM API producing ideas for how to perform sabotage. This problem seems trickier to solve, and figuring out how big of an issue this is involves thinking about steganographic communication and encoded reasoning, which is out-of-scope for this post.Why I am more pessimistic about other solutionsMonitoring the external APII think monitoring external LLM APIs can help, but that is unlikely to be sufficient.Why not just monitor the external API like you monitor the internal API?Traffic understanding. You might not understand external LLM API traffic as well as internal traffic. If you want to know if some usage is red-teaming, or sandboxed usage, or sensitive usage, you can ask people inside the company, but you usually can’t ask external API users as easily (and it is harder to verify their claims).Cost. This lack of understanding means it could be harder to focus monitoring effort in the right place and take more drastic and costly measures to prevent potentially catastrophic actions during the most sensitive usage. This can result in large costs, both in the amount of AI and human labor spent reviewing less sensitive parts of the traffic, and usefulness cost when applying interventions to parts of the traffic that are less sensitive. External traffic might also be much bigger than internal traffic (though it depends on the economics of intelligence explosions, and seems plausible only in longer timelines where the AI R&D returns to AI labor are small).User privacy. User privacy might limit how much in-depth monitoring you can do. Companies often care a lot that AI companies can’t read their LLM usage, and this might be hard to change. This hinders human monitoring.Coordination. If the external LLM API is built by DeepCent, it is hard for OpenMind to make sure DeepCent's monitoring is good enough to prevent catastrophes from happening.The main way I can see it as being sufficient is if all actors carefully monitor and block any usage that looks like it has access to internal resources of AI companies in order to avoid speeding up other AI companies - but that seems unlikely to me given the current trajectory, and it might be technically difficult to detect such traffic without preventing general software engineering and research.Preventing access to external APIsI think blocking access to external APIs is something that can help reduce the amount of code that is run that has the security permissions to access both the internet and sensitive internal permissions, but I would be surprised if it could drive it to something negligible.Why not just block internet access or block access to the relevant websites?There are malicious human actors that will help AIs get these permissions because routing such traffic would let you access valuable secrets. This means that targeted bans might not suffice.Not giving AIs internet access would probably be a large tax on SAIR productivity - interacting with the internet is useful in many ways, especially in the world where there are external APIs (as the external world would also massively use large amounts of AI labor in ways which are almost surely relevant to staying competitive).And even if you solved the problem of LLM API proxies, there are good reasons to sometimes give your SAIR access to external LLM APIs and sensitive internal permissions, for example when improving the external LLM API or when trying to learn from the API of other model providers. It might be possible to mostly eliminate this risk by splitting sensitive resources, but it is unclear how costly such division of sensitive resources would be.Monitoring access to sensitive permissionsOne last way you can prevent a catastrophe from happening is monitoring the usage of sensitive permissions. I think this is a valid way to reduce risk, and would probably be hard to bypass - which makes this “rogue” internal deployment via external APIs not totally rogue. But I’d still be surprised if it enabled reducing risk by more than 50%.Final thoughtsOverall I find this particular threat somewhat concerning, though not less tractable than other forms of rogue internal deployments.On a more meta-level, I find it concerning that I found this new way in which AIs could set up rogue deployments roughly a year after having first tried to catalog ways in which AIs could set up a rogue deployment.Discuss", "source": "ai_ai_alignment_forum", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fqRmcuspZuYBNiQuQ/rogue-internal-deployments-via-external-apis", "published_date": "2025-10-15T19:34:34", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T06:42:06.065157", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "ai-safety", "alignment"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "AI Alignment Forum", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 1668, "author": "Fabien Roger", "raw_content_length": 12449, "priority": 9, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 8.34, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["LLM", "API"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 10406, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Rogue internal deployments", "external APIs", "October", "sensitive access", "weights", "safety controls", "a weakly-monitored external API version", "itself", "another AI", "what"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["another AI"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Rogue internal deployments": 2.0, "external APIs": 2.0, "October": 1.0, "sensitive access": 1.0, "weights": 1.0, "safety controls": 1.0, "a weakly-monitored external API version": 1.0, "itself": 1.0, "another AI": 1.0, "what": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 11.218698118055555, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.088000000000001, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.8176, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.3134, "joy": 0.0074, "surprise": 0.0161, "sadness": 0.0247, "fear": 0.3038, "anger": 0.2514, "disgust": 0.0832}, "emotion_method": "local"}}

Le pedí a Gemini que generara diferentes vistas de un \"estampador\": una vista frontal, una vista trasera, una vista de perfil y una isométrica. El resultado fue bastante impresionante: Las imágenes generadas por la IA me sirvieron como una base muy sólida para crear un modelo 3D bastante decente. Aunque la topología aún requiere trabajo manual para ser óptima, y la texturización está un paso más allá (sigue siendo un proceso bastante artesanal para lograr resultados de alta calidad), el punto de partida que ofrece la IA es innegable. Esto me lleva a una serie de preguntas que creo que son cruciales para la comunidad de artistas 3D y desarrolladores: ¿El proceso de creación de assets 3D sigue siendo fundamentalmente \"artesanal\"? A pesar de los avances en la IA, ¿cuánto de la creación de un asset de calidad AAA sigue dependiendo de la habilidad y el toque humano? ¿Qué tecnologías están por liderar la industria del modelado 3D? ¿Veremos un salto masivo en herramientas asistidas por IA que automaticen gran parte del proceso, desde la creación de modelos hasta la texturización y el rigging? ¿El trabajo está \"muerto\" para los modeladores 3D, o qué le espera al artista 3D del futuro? Personalmente, no creo que el trabajo esté 4muerto, sino que está evolucionando. Pero, ¿hacia dónde? ¿Se necesitará más especialización o más generalismo? En un mundo donde la IA puede generar rápidamente bases para modelos, ¿será más valioso un \"prompt senior de 3D\" capaz de dirigir la IA y pulir sus resultados, o un especialista en áreas muy específicas como la optimización de topología o la creación de materiales procedurales complejos?", "source": "community_social_dev_to", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://dev.to/yomero243/el-futuro-del-modelado-es-la-ia-o-la-especializacion-240b", "published_date": "2025-09-30T06:14:18", "collected_date": "2025-09-30T06:43:39.259353", "language": "es", "tags": ["trends", "webdev", "tutorials", "spanish", "developer", "hunyuan", "community", "español", "community_social"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "DEV Community", "source_category": "community_social", "word_count": 307, "author": "Gabriel Cerdio", "raw_content_length": 1939, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 12, "reading_time_minutes": 1.535, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["IA me", "Hola"], "persons": ["Tencent Hunyuan"], "locations": ["Tencent Hunyuan"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1869, "language_detected": "es", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["El futuro", "modelado", "la especialización", "Hola", "todos", "las capacidades", "generación", "imágenes", "Tencent", "Gemini"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"El futuro": 2.0, "modelado": 2.0, "la especialización": 2.0, "Hola": 1.0, "todos": 1.0, "las capacidades": 1.0, "generación": 1.0, "imágenes": 1.0, "Tencent": 1.0, "Gemini": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 0.6800397561111111, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 5.0, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.0, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}}

In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a \"thinker\" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an \"executor\" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies.

{"id": "portuguese_canaltech_ab05291a60ad", "title": "Gemini 3 é a nova IA mais potente e criativa do Google; veja novidades", "content": "O Google anunciou nesta terça-feira (18) o novo modelo de IA Gemini 3, considerado o mais inteligente da empresa até o momento. O LLM tem melhorias nas habilidades de programação e consegue criar mais experiências interativas e multimodais. Como usar a IA Gemini do Google | Guia Prático Gemini Flash e Pro: quando é indicado usar cada modelo de IA do Google? A novidade já está disponível para todas as contas no aplicativo do Gemini e no Modo IA da pesquisa do Google — é a primeira vez que a empresa libera um modelo novo simultaneamente para o chatbot e para o buscador. Na experiência geral, a Gigante de Mountain View destaca que a IA gera respostas mais inteligentes e concisas. Na parte de programação, o vibe coding segue em alta com um modelo mais inteligente para as tarefas relacionadas à àrea. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Novidades do Gemini Veja os destaques do salto de geração: Interfaces generativas Maior compreensão multimodal Novo visual no app Busca mais inteligente Novo Google Antigravity Interfaces generativas Pela primeira vez, o Google traz interfaces generativas ao Gemini para criar plataformas visuais e interativas completas durante uma conversa normal com o chatbot. São dois novos recursos — Visual Layout (“Diagramação visual”, em tradução livre) e Dynamic View (“Visualização dinâmica”). O primeiro cria uma experiência mais imersiva da pesquisa, com fotos, vídeos e tabelas, como se a pessoa visitasse um site especializado no assunto. A segunda opção consegue criar uma interface em tempo real, como um aplicativo que roda na web. Como exemplo, o Google pediu para o Gemini criar um espaço para explicar a trajetória de Vincent van Gogh com suas respectivas obras e o pedido foi atendido. Gemini 3 consegue criar interfaces em poucos segundos a partir de prompts simples (Imagem: Divulgação/Google) Maior compreensão multimodal A Gigante das Buscas destaca a evolução multimodal da IA, com desempenhos superiores nos testes de benchmark que envolvem prompts com diferentes formatos de mídia. Além de entender comandos em voz, texto, imagem, vídeo e código, o Gemini 3 consegue identificar particularidades de cada prompt e adaptá-las para diferentes formatos. Mandar uma imagem e pedir para extrair as principais anotações pode ter resultados melhores, por exemplo. Novo visual no app O aplicativo do Gemini para celulares ganhou algumas mudanças. Agora, é possível acessar uma aba com as suas mídias mais recentes, ideal para quem gera muitas imagens com o Nano Banana, além de acessar comandos rápidos para as principais funções da IA. Busca mais inteligente O Gemini 3 chegou ao Modo IA da busca para trazer resultados mais completos e até interativos. Há um novo modo “Thinking”, voltado para pesquisas complexas e que precisam de um tempo maior para gerar uma resposta. Assim como a OpenAI faz com o ChatGPT, o Google pretende implementar um roteador para decidir automaticamente se aquele prompt exige um modelo mais poderoso ou uma alternativa mais rápida. O modo no buscador ainda consegue criar experiências mais interativas e com maior apelo visual, adaptadas em tempo real de acordo com os pedidos do usuário. Modo IA da busca conta com função que usa o modelo Pro, considerado o mais avançado da família Gemini 3(Imagem: Divulgação/Google) Novo Google Antigravity A empresa revelou a nova plataforma Antigravity, voltada para desenvolvimento com uso de agentes de IA. O aplicativo permite delegar os agentes para diferentes tarefas entre terminal, browser e editor, enquanto a pessoa pode monitorar o desempenho de cada um deles. A novidade está disponível em prévia e pode ser baixada para Windows, macOS e Linux. Leia também: O que é pago e o que é gratuito no Gemini? Veja a lista Vale a pena pagar por uma IA?

Chamado Windows Edge Light, ele foi criado por Scott Hanselman e gera um brilho suave nas bordas da tela para ajudar na iluminação durante chamadas de vídeo e transmissões ao vivo. Aparelho com IA grava e transforma seus sonhos em vídeo; veja como funciona GitHub une ChatGPT, Gemini e mais em novo hub de agentes de IA para programação O programa é leve e funciona como uma camada transparente que acompanha a tela sem atrapalhar o uso de outros aplicativos. O efeito fica sempre visível por cima das janelas, criando uma luz de apoio direta no rosto do usuário. O Windows Edge Light também se ajusta automaticamente ao monitor principal, mesmo em setups com várias telas ou telas 4K, e permite controlar o brilho por atalhos ou por um pequeno painel que aparece ao passar o mouse. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- A seguir, tire suas dúvidas sobre: Como baixar e instalar o Windows Edge Light? Como ajustar a iluminação do Windows Edge Light? Windows Edge Light pode fazer parte do PowerToys Como baixar e instalar o Windows Edge Light? Existem duas formas de testar o aplicativo. A mais simples é baixar o executável pronto na página de Releases do GitHub. Para isso: Acesse a página do Release do GitHub (github.com); Vá até “v1.0”; Clique em “Assets”; Baixe o arquivo “WindowsEdgeLight-v1.0-win-x64.exe”; Execute o arquivo baixado — ele já vem com o necessário para rodar, sem precisar instalar o .NET separadamente. Aplicativo da Microsoft transforma o monitor do PC em uma ring light digital. (Imagem: Scott Hanselman/GitHub) Como ajustar a iluminação do Windows Edge Light? O Windows Edge Light permite controlar o brilho pelo teclado ou por um pequeno painel que aparece na tela. Os atalhos de teclado são os seguintes: Ctrl + Shift + Seta para cima: aumenta a intensidade da luz; Ctrl + Shift + Seta para baixo: reduz o brilho; Ctrl + Shift + L: ativa ou desativa o efeito imediatamente. Windows Edge Light pode fazer parte do PowerToys Por ser uma ferramenta pequena e prática, o Windows Edge Light já é apontado por usuários como um candidato natural a integrar o Microsoft PowerToys, pacote de utilitários para Windows. Se isso acontecer, o recurso pode ficar mais conhecido e alcançar mais usuários, tornando-se uma solução oficial de iluminação digital para PCs com Windows.

{"id": "community_social_reddit_local_llama_86bae7142cc9", "title": "A highly adaptable toolkit to build APIs and agents, with friendly interfaces for streaming and multimodality", "content": "Hi everyone! I've been working for quite a while on a toolkit/framework to build APIs and agents easily, in a way friendly to developers that would not hide complexity behind abstractions, but that would also be in step with modern requirements and capabilities: stateful, async execution, streaming, multimodality, persistence, etc. I thought this community would be a perfect place to get feedback, and also that the library itself can be genuinely useful here, so feedback is very welcome! Landing page with a few nice demos: https://actionengine.dev/ Code examples in Python, TypeScript, C++: https://github.com/google-deepmind/actionengine/tree/main/examples To get an overall grasp, check out the stateful ollama chat sessions example: demo, backend handlers, server, chat page frontend code. Why another framework? I don't really like the word, but it's hard to find anything better and still have people understand what the project is about. IMO, the problem of \"agentic frameworks\" is that they give excessively rigid abstractions. The novel challenge is not to \"define\" \"agents\". They are just chains of calls in some distributed context. The actual novel challenge is to build tools and cultivate a common language to express highly dynamic, highly experimental interactions performantly (and safely!) in very different kinds of applications and environments. In other words, the challenge is to acknowledge and enable the diversity of applications and contexts code runs from. That means that the framework itself should allow experimentation and adapt to applications, not have applications adapt to it. I work at Google DeepMind (hence releasing Action Engine under the org), and the intention for me and co-authors/internal supporters is to validate some shifts we think the agent landscape is experiencing, have a quick-feedback way to navigate that, including checking very non-mainstream approaches. Some examples for me are: developers don't seem to really need \"loop runner\" type frameworks with tight abstractions, but rather a set of thin layers they can combine to: relieve \"daily\", \"boring\" issues (e.g. serialisation of custom types, chaining tasks), have consistent, similar ways to store and transmit state and express agentic behaviour across backend peers, browser clients, model servers etc. (maybe edge devices even), \"productionise\": serve, scale, authorise, discover, it is important to design such tools and frameworks at the full stack to enable builders of all types of apps: web/native, client orchestration or a worker group in a cluster, etc., data representation, storage and transport matter much more than the runtime/execution context. I'm strongly convinced that such a framework should be absolutely flexible to runtimes, and should accommodate different \"wire\" protocols and different storage backends to be useful for the general public. Therefore interactions with those layers are extensible: for \"wire\" connections, there are websockets and WebRTC (and Stubby internally at Google), and this can be extended, for \"store\", there is an in-memory implementation and one over Redis streams (also can be extended!) What the library is, exactly Action Engine is built as a kit of optional components, for different needs of different applications. IMO that makes it stand out from other frameworks: they lock you in the whole set of abstractions, which you might not need. The core concepts are action and async node. \"Action\" is simple: it's just executable code with a name and i/o schema assigned, and some well-defined behaviour to prepare and clean up. Async node is a logical \"stream\" of data: a channel-like interface that one party (or parties!) can write into, and another can read with a \"block with timeout\" semantics. These core concepts are easy to understand. Unlike with loaded terms like \"agent\", \"context\" or \"graph executor\", you won't make any huge mistake thinking about actions as about functions, and about async nodes as about channels or queues that go as inputs and outputs to those functions. The rest of the library simply cares about building context to run or call actions, and lets you do that yourself—there are implementations: for particular-backend wire streams, for sessions that share a data context between action runs, for services that hold multiple sessions and route wire connections into them, for servers that listen to connections / do access control / etc. ...but it's not a package offering. No layer is obligatory, and in your particular project, you may end up having a nicer integration and less complexity than if you used ADK, for example. Flexibility to integrate any use case, model or API, and flexibility to run in different infrastructure are first-class concerns here, and so is avoiding large cognitive footprint. Anyway, I'd be grateful for feedback! Have a look, try it out—the project is WIP and the level of documentation is definitely less than needed, but I'll be happy to answer any questions! submitted by /u/apnkv [link] [comments]", "source":

The only problem is they haven't open sourced it just like how anthropic did with MCPs. Since then I started working on this SDK which serves the same purpose and also LLM agnostic. Now you can build conversational apps with just 2 config files, where you need to configure your MCP servers in one file and you need to register your custom components in another file. Just checkout the repo to find out more Try It Out A sample application developed with an MCP server with fake store API P.S : A Call for Collaboration I tried publishing it to npm but ran into some issues (turns out packaging is trickier than it looks 😅). If you have experience with npm or package publishing, I’d love your guidance or a PR. Let’s make this SDK easy for anyone to use.

{"id": "arxiv_4190c89e48fa", "title": "NeoDictaBERT: Pushing the Frontier of BERT models for Hebrew", "content": "Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size (BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual: BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20386v1",

{"id": "arxiv_b32ef16ed57a", "title": "AutoGraphAD: A novel approach using Variational Graph Autoencoders for anomalous network flow detection", "content": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential tools for detecting network attacks and intrusions. While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.",

{"id": "arxiv_c5dc665f2fb9", "title": "ZoFia: Zero-Shot Fake News Detection with Entity-Guided Retrieval and Multi", "content": "The rapid spread of fake news threatens social stability and public trust, rendering its detection an imperative research priority. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at numerous natural language processing tasks with their remarkable contextual understanding and extensive prior knowledge, the time-bounded knowledge coverage and tendency for generating hallucination content reduce their reliability when handling fast-evolving news streams. Furthermore, models trained on existing static datasets also often lack the generalization needed for emerging news topics. To address these challenges, we propose ZoFia, a novel two-stage zero-shot fake news detection framework. First, we introduce Hierarchical Salience to quantify the importance of entities in the news content, and propose the SC-MMR algorithm to effectively select an informative and diverse set of keywords that serve as queries for retrieving up-to-date external evidence. Subsequently, a multi LLM interactive system, in which each agent assumes a distinct role, performs multi-view collaborative analysis and adversarial debate over the news text and its related information, and finally produces an interpretable and robust judgment. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ZoFia obviously outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and most of few-shot methods. Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related communities.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01188v1", "published_date": "2025-11-03T03:29:42",

{"id": "arxiv_222542f12a9a", "title": "Robustness Verification of Graph Neural Networks Via Lightweight Satisfiability Testing", "content": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers, which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18591v1", "published_date":

Experiments are conducted using aluminum alloy specimens coated with ML film sensor on their surfaces. During the tensile process, ML images of the films and speckle images of the specimen backsides are simultaneously acquired. Combined with DIC technology, high-precision full-field strain distributions are obtained. Through spatial registration and region matching algorithms, a quantitative calibration model between ML intensity and DIC strain is established. The research results indicate that the ML intensity and DIC strain exhibit a significant linear correlation (R2 = 0.92). To verify the universality of the model, aluminum alloy notched specimen tests show that the reconstructed strain field is in good agreement with the DIC and finite element analysis results, with an average relative error of 0.23%.

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_d072ebaf270d", "title": "How Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter Elevates Storytelling", "content": "Mastering the Narrative: How Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter Elevates Storytelling The adage \"Show, don't tell\" is a cornerstone of effective writing, guiding authors to immerse readers in a story through vivid descriptions, actions, and dialogue rather than simply stating facts or emotions. While universally acknowledged as crucial, mastering this technique can be challenging, often requiring extensive revision and a keen eye for detail. Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter emerges as a powerful digital assistant, designed to transform flat narration into rich, sensory-driven prose, thereby empowering authors to craft more engaging and impactful stories. How the 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter Works At its core, the Midgen AI 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter functions as an intelligent rewriting engine. Authors interact with the tool by providing specific inputs that guide the AI's transformation process: Inputting Flat Narration: The primary step involves the author pasting or typing their existing text‚Äîsentences or paragraphs that might be 'telling' rather than 'showing'‚Äîinto a designated input field. This could be a description of a character's emotion, a setting, or an event. Contextual Parameters: To ensure the rewritten text aligns with the author's vision and the story's nuances, the tool allows for additional contextual information: Setting: Authors can describe the environment where the scene takes place (e.g., \"a bustling marketplace\"). This helps the AI infuse sensory details relevant to the location. Characters: Providing details about the characters involved (e.g., \"a young thief, a wise merchant\") enables the AI to tailor actions and reactions to their personalities and roles. Main Conflict: Specifying the central conflict of the scene or story (e.g., \"the thief stealing from the merchant\") ensures the rewritten text enhances the underlying tension and stakes. Refinement Options: The tool often includes toggles or options for further control, such as whether the rewritten text should maintain the original length as much as possible, or if the content contains adult themes, allowing the AI to adjust its tone and vocabulary accordingly. Upon receiving these inputs, the AI leverages advanced natural language processing and generation techniques to analyze the 'telling' phrases and reconstruct them into 'showing' prose. It identifies abstract statements and replaces them with concrete actions, sensory details, and evocative imagery, effectively painting a picture for the reader rather than merely describing it. How It Helps Authors The 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter offers a multitude of benefits for authors, from novice writers seeking to improve their craft to seasoned professionals looking for an efficient editing aid: Elevating Prose Quality: The most direct benefit is the immediate improvement in writing quality. By converting abstract statements into vivid descriptions, the tool helps authors create more immersive and engaging narratives. Overcoming Descriptive Writer's Block: Authors often struggle to find fresh ways to describe emotions, settings, or character traits. The converter provides creative alternatives, offering new perspectives and breaking through creative impasses. Learning and Internalizing the Technique: Beyond simply rewriting text, the tool serves as an educational aid. By observing how the AI transforms 'telling' into 'showing,' authors can gradually internalize the principles, improving their own writing instincts over time. Ensuring Consistency: For longer works, maintaining a consistent level of descriptive richness can be challenging. The tool helps ensure that even mundane descriptions are elevated, contributing to a cohesive and high-quality narrative throughout. Speeding Up the Writing Process Writing, especially the revision phase, can be time-consuming. The 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter significantly accelerates several aspects of the writing workflow: Efficient Self-Editing: Instead of manually scrutinizing every sentence for 'telling' phrases, authors can quickly process sections of their manuscript through the tool, identifying and rectifying areas that need more 'showing.' This drastically reduces the time spent on a critical aspect of editing. Rapid Draft Improvement: Early drafts often contain a higher proportion of 'telling' as authors focus on getting the story down. The converter allows for quick enhancement of these drafts, making them more readable and engaging much earlier in the process. Reduced Cognitive Load: By offloading the task of rephrasing to the AI, authors can conserve their mental energy for higher-level creative decisions, such as plot development, character arcs, and thematic exploration. Streamlined Feedback Integration: When receiving feedback to 'show more,' authors can use the tool to implement these suggestions rapidly, rather than spending hours brainstorming new descriptive language. Making Suspense More Effective on Readers Suspense thrives on anticipation, atmosphere, and the subtle unfolding of events. The 'Show, Don't Tell' technique is paramount in building effective suspense, and the AI converter enhances this in several ways: Building Atmosphere: Instead of stating that a place is eerie, the tool can help describe the creaking floorboards, the shadows dancing in the corners, or the sudden drop in temperature, allowing readers to feel the eeriness. This sensory immersion heightens tension and makes the suspense more palpable. Gradual Revelation: Suspense often relies on revealing information slowly and indirectly. The converter can help rephrase direct statements about threats or dangers into suggestive details, leaving readers to piece together the implications and increasing their engagement and anxiety. Character Reactions: By showing a character's physical manifestations of fear‚Äîa trembling hand, a quickened breath, darting eyes‚Äîrather than simply stating they are scared, the AI helps convey the emotional stakes more powerfully. This allows readers to empathize more deeply and experience the suspense alongside the character. Pacing and Rhythm: The detailed, sensory language generated by the tool can naturally slow down the narrative in crucial moments, drawing out tension and building anticipation before a reveal or a sudden event, which is vital for effective suspense. Finding the Way Out at the Edge of the Story and Creating More Authors often face moments in their writing where they feel stuck, particularly when a scene or character interaction feels flat, or they struggle to transition between plot points. The 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter can be a valuable asset in these situations: Unlocking New Descriptive Avenues: When a scene feels stagnant, running a 'telling' passage through the converter can reveal new descriptive possibilities. The AI might suggest an action, a piece of dialogue, or a sensory detail that not only improves the immediate text but also sparks ideas for subsequent scenes or character development. Revealing Subtext and Nuance: By forcing a shift from explicit statements to implicit demonstrations, the tool can help authors uncover deeper layers of meaning, subtext, and nuance in their characters' motivations and relationships. This can lead to more complex and compelling narrative arcs. Inspiring Plot Progression: Sometimes, a lack of vivid detail can obscure potential plot developments. When the AI transforms a bland description into an active, sensory experience, it can highlight overlooked connections or introduce new elements that propel the story forward. Enhancing World-Building: For fantasy or sci-fi authors, 'showing' the world rather than 'telling' about it is crucial. The converter can help authors articulate the unique sights, sounds, and feelings of their fictional worlds, making them more real and immersive for readers, and potentially inspiring further world-building details. In conclusion, Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter is more than just a stylistic editor; it's a creative partner that helps authors embody one of writing's most fundamental principles. By facilitating the transformation of abstract ideas into concrete, sensory experiences, it not only refines prose but also deepens reader engagement, sharpens suspense, and provides a fertile ground for overcoming creative blocks and expanding narrative possibilities. It empowers authors to write with greater impact, ensuring their stories don't just tell, but truly show.", "source": "community_social_dev_to", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://dev.to/mdsiaofficial/how-midgen-ais-show-dont-tell-converter-elevates-storytelling-49m4", "published_date": "2025-10-13T06:14:11", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T06:44:17.629398", "language": "en", "tags": ["trends", "developer", "writing", "books", "tutorials", "community", "pubsub", "community_social"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "DEV Community", "source_category": "community_social", "word_count": 1233, "author": "Md Shoriful Islam Ashiq", "raw_content_length": 9265, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 12, "reading_time_minutes": 6.165, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Inputti", "Midgen AI's 'Show"], "persons": ["Midgen AI's 'Show"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 8528, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Midgen AIs Show", "the Narrative", "How Midgen AIs Show", "Converter Elevates", "The adage", "Show", "a cornerstone", "effective writing", "guiding authors", "readers"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Midgen AIs Show"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Midgen AIs Show": 3.0, "the Narrative": 1.0, "How Midgen AIs Show": 1.0, "Converter Elevates": 1.0, "The adage": 1.0, "Show": 1.0, "a cornerstone": 1.0, "effective writing": 1.0, "guiding authors": 1.0, "readers": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 0.5546129158333333, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.6755, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.7351, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8059, "joy": 0.0081, "surprise": 0.0067, "sadness": 0.0056, "fear": 0.1049, "anger": 0.0246, "disgust": 0.0443}, "emotion_method": "local"}}
{"id": "arxiv_968e9a1f36ec", "title": "Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response", "content": "This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners.

Each iteration introduces small deviations from best practices. The AI optimizes for immediate problem-solving rather than long-term maintainability. Variable names become generic. You use comments as an excuse to replace clear code. Functions grow longer. Domain concepts blur into technical implementations. The codebase transforms into AI slop: technically functional but semantically hollow code. You request simple changes: rename something, extract something, improve clarity. Each iteration shifts names, removes nuance, and replaces domain words with generic ones. Your code no longer accurately reflects the real-world domain. You lose the shape of the system. This is slow erosion. Sample Code üìñ Wrong ‚ùå def process_data(d, t='standard'): \"\"\"Process customer data\"\"\" if t == 'standard': result = [] for item in d: if item.get('status') == 'active': temp = item.copy() temp['processed'] = True total = 0 for x in temp.get('items', []): total += x.get('price', 0) temp['total'] = total result.append(temp) return result elif t == 'premium': result = [] for item in d: if item.get('status') == 'active' and \\ item.get('tier') == 'premium': temp = item.copy() temp['processed'] = True total = 0 for x in temp.get('items', []): total += x.get('price', 0) * 0.9 temp['total'] = total result.append(temp) return result return [] Right üëâ class CustomerOrder: def __init__(self, customer, items, status): self._customer = customer self._items = items self._status = status def is_active(self): return self._status.is_active() def calculate_total(self): return self._customer.apply_pricing_tier( sum(item.price() for item in self._items) ) def mark_as_processed(self): return ProcessedOrder(self, self.calculate_total()) class OrderProcessor: def process_active_orders(self, orders): return [ order.mark_as_processed() for order in orders if order.is_active() ] Detection üîç [X] Manual You can detect AI-degraded code by reviewing commit history for patterns: consecutive AI-assisted commits without human refactoring, increasing function length over time, proliferation of generic variable names (data, temp, result, item), growing comment-to-code ratio, and duplicated logic with minor variations. Code review tools can track these metrics and flag potential degradation. Exceptions üõë AI assistance remains valuable for boilerplate generation, test case creation, and initial prototyping when you immediately review and refactor the output. The smell appears when you chain multiple AI modifications without human intervention or when you accept AI suggestions without understanding their implications. Tags üè∑Ô∏è Technical Debt Level üîã [x] Intermediate Why the Bijection Is Important üó∫Ô∏è Your code should maintain a clear Bijection between domain concepts in the MAPPERand your implementation. When AI assistants modify code without understanding your domain, they break this mapping. A \"Customer\" becomes \"data\", an \"Order\" becomes \"item\", and \"apply pricing tier\" becomes \"calculate total with discount\". You lose the vocabulary that connects your code to business reality. Each AI iteration moves further from domain language toward generic programming constructs, making the code harder to understand and maintain. AI Generation ü§ñ AI generators frequently create this smell when you prompt them to modify existing code multiple times. Each interaction optimizes for the immediate request without considering the cumulative architectural impact. The AI suggests quick fixes that work but don't align with your codebase's design patterns or domain model. AI assistants tend to replace domain language with generic language. They optimize for pattern consistency instead of meaning. They smooth away intent. AI Detection üß≤ AI can address this issue if you instruct it to restore domain terms and request that it explain its naming choices. You are accountable for the work you delegate to the AI, and you must approve every change. Try Them! üõ† Remember: AI Assistants make lots of mistakes Suggested Prompt: \"Review this code for domain clarity. Replace generic names with domain concepts. Extract duplicated logic into cohesive objects. Ensure each class and method represents a clear business concept. Show me the domain model this code implements.\" Without Proper Instructions With Specific Instructions ChatGPT ChatGPT Claude Claude Perplexity Perplexity Copilot Copilot You You Gemini Gemini DeepSeek DeepSeek Meta AI Meta AI Grok Grok Qwen Qwen Conclusion üèÅ The \"Habsburg problem\" analogy in AI, also called \"Habsburg AI,\" refers to how AI models can degrade when repeatedly trained on content generated primarily by other AI models, like the inbreeding issues suffered by the Habsburg royal family. This causes a loss of diversity and robustness in the AI's outputs, eventually leading AI's responses to become progressively worse or semantically hollow. You must actively review and refactor AI-generated code to maintain quality. Treat AI assistants as junior developers whose work requires supervision. Each AI suggestion should strengthen your domain model, not weaken it. When you notice generic patterns replacing domain language, stop and refactor. Your code's long-term maintainability depends on preserving the connection between business concepts and implementation.

{"id": "arxiv_ec44906bcae4", "title": "A Single Set of Adversarial Clothes Breaks Multiple Defense Methods in the Physical World", "content": "In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack. However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over 64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against adversarial clothes.

{"id": "community_social_reddit_local_llama_59ba06577728", "title": "Anyone else running their whole AI stack as Proxmox LXC containers? Im currently using Open WebUI as front", "content": "I have not implemented it yet, but I believe it should be possible for LiteLLM to interface with the Proxmox API and dynamically turn on and off vLLM containers depening on what model users select (in Open WebUI). Does anyone have any experience with this? I want to add a container for n8n for automation workflows (connected to LiteLLM for AI models), a websearch MCP container running something like Searxng (because I find the web search implementation in Open WebUI to be extremely limited) and an (agentic) RAG service. I need robust retrieval over professional/Dutch GAAP/IFRS accounting materials, internal company docs, client data, and relevant laws/regulations. There seem to be a million ways to do RAG; this will be the cornerstone of the system. I built this AI server/Workstation for the Dutch accounting firm I work at (I have no IT background myself so its been quite the learning proces). Managment wanted everything local and I jumped on the oppertunity to learn something new. My specs: CPU - AMD EPYC 9575F Dual GMI links allowing it to use almost all of the theoretical system memory bandwidth, 5Ghz Boost clock, 64 core, 128 thread beast of a CPU, seems to me like the best choice for an AI exterimentation server. Great as a host for GPU inference, Hybrid Inference (GPU + System memory spillover) and CPU only inference. RAM - 1.152tb (12x96gb RDIMMs ) ECC DDR5 6.400MT/s RAM (~614gb/s theoretical max bandwidth). Will allow me to run massive MOE models on the CPU, albeit slowly. Also plenty or ram for any other service I want to run. MOBO - Supermicro H13SSL-N (Rev. 2.01). I have a Supermicro H14SSL-NT on backorder but it could be a couple of weeks before I get that one. GPU's - 3x Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Max-Q. I was planning on getting 2 Workstation editions but the supplier kept fucking up my order and sending me the Max Q's. Eventually caved and got a third Max-Q because I had plenty of cooling and power capacity. 3 gpu's is not ideal for tensor parallelism but pipleline- and expert parallelism are decent alternatives when 2x96 gb is not enough. Maybe I'll get a 4th one eventually. Storage - A bunch of Kioxia CM7 R's. Gpt-oss 120b is the main 'workhorse' model. It comfortably fits in a single GPU so I can use the other GPU's to run auxiliary models that can assist gpt-oss 120b. Maybe a couple of gpt-oss 20b models in a websearch mcp server, a vision language model like Qwen 3 VL, Deepseek-OCR or Gemma 3 for pictures/files. As mentioned, I don‚Äôt come from an IT background, so I‚Äôm looking for practical advice and sanity checks. How does this setup look? Is there anything you‚Äôd fundamentally do differently? I followed a bunch of guides (mostly the excellent ones from DigitalSpaceport), got about 90% of the way with ChatGPT 5 Thinking, and figured out the last 10% through trial and error (Proxmox Snapshots make the trail and error approach really easy). submitted by /u/AFruitShopOwner [link] [comments]", "source": "community_social_reddit_local_llama", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "arxiv_a83dc2d8e32a", "title": "Difficulty", "content": "Despite its potential, AI advances in music education are hindered by proprietary systems that limit the democratization of technology in this domain. In particular, AI-driven music difficulty adjustment is especially promising, as simplifying complex pieces can make music education more inclusive and accessible to learners of all ages and contexts. Nevertheless, recent efforts have relied on proprietary datasets, which prevents the research community from reproducing, comparing, or extending the current state of the art. In addition, while these generative methods offer great potential, most of them use the MIDI format, which, unlike others, such as MusicXML, lacks readability and layout information, thereby limiting their practical use for human performers. This work introduces a transformer-based method for adjusting the difficulty of MusicXML piano scores. Unlike previous methods, which rely on annotated datasets, we propose a synthetic dataset composed of pairs of piano scores ordered by estimated difficulty, with each pair comprising a more challenging and easier arrangement of the same piece. We generate these pairs by creating variations conditioned on the same melody and harmony and leverage pretrained models to assess difficulty and style, ensuring appropriate pairing. The experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed approach, showing accurate control of playability and target difficulty, as highlighted through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In contrast to previous work, we openly release all resources (code, dataset, and models), ensuring reproducibility while fostering open-source innovation to help bridge the digital divide.",

{"id": "arxiv_6a8be1963216", "title": "Classification of worldwide news articles by perceived quality, 2018", "content": "This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC.

{"id": "positive_news_frontiers_sustainable_cities_d2b0edc47e0d", "title": "Evaluating the effectiveness of the city master plan in regulating future urban spatial growth of Varanasi city, India", "content": "This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the Varanasi City Master Plan 2031 in regulating urban growth by analyzing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes. By comparing the model's predictions for 2031 with the Varanasi Development Authority's Master Plan, the study identifies discrepancies in the direction and extent of urban expansion. Rapid urbanization, driven by industrialization, migration, and infrastructural development, has dramatically reshaped Varanasi's spatial patterns. Utilizing remote sensing data from Landsat images (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2021) and integrating machine learning techniques, including the Multi-layer Perceptron and Markov Chain Analysis (MLP-MCA), this study simulates and predicts future urban expansion. The model's predictions, with an accuracy above 80%, offer critical insights for policymakers to revisit urban planning strategies. The built-up area has grown from 45.10 km2 in 1990 to a projected 262.05 km2 by 2031, representing a 480.95% increase over four decades. Simultaneously, agricultural acreage has declined from 908.23 km2 to 656 km2, a reduction of 252.23 km2, or 27.77%, highlighting the shift from rural to urban land use. Notably, in the southwest, the Masterplan consistently exceeds predicted built-up areas across most zones, except in Zone 4 (9–12 km), with over-allocations around the Mughalsarai area. Furthermore, Sectors A, B, C, and D anticipate higher built-up areas, particularly in zones 6–9 km and 9–12 km. This study underscores the need for sustainable development planning to mitigate the negative impacts of rapid urbanization, such as loss of green spaces, environmental degradation, and urban heat island effects. The combined approach of remote sensing and machine learning provides a robust and replicable methodology for other rapidly urbanizing cities, ensuring future expansion aligns with sustainable development goals.", "source": "positive_news_frontiers_sustainable_cities", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2025.1649418", "published_date":

It offers a suite of optimized kernels, that support fast and lossless inference of 1.58-bit models on CPU and GPU (NPU support will coming next). The first release of bitnet.cpp is to support inference on CPUs. bitnet.cpp achieves speedups of 1.37x to 5.07x on ARM CPUs, with larger models experiencing greater performance gains. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption by 55.4% to 70.0%, further boosting overall efficiency. On x86 CPUs, speedups range from 2.37x to 6.17x with energy reductions between 71.9% to 82.2%. Furthermore, bitnet.cpp can run a 100B BitNet b1.58 model on a single CPU, achieving speeds comparable to human reading (5-7 tokens per second), significantly enhancing the potential for running LLMs on local devices. Please refer to the technical report for more details. The tested models are dummy setups used in a research context to demonstrate the inference performance of bitnet.cpp. Demo A demo of bitnet.cpp running a BitNet b1.58 3B model on Apple M2: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f46b736-edec-4828-b809-4be780a3e5b1 What's New: 05/20/2025 BitNet Official GPU inference kernel 04/14/2025 BitNet Official 2B Parameter Model on Hugging Face 02/18/2025 Bitnet.cpp: Efficient Edge Inference for Ternary LLMs 11/08/2024 BitNet a4.8: 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs 10/21/2024 1-bit AI Infra: Part 1.1, Fast and Lossless BitNet b1.58 Inference on CPUs 10/17/2024 bitnet.cpp 1.0 released. 03/21/2024 The-Era-of-1-bit-LLMs__Training_Tips_Code_FAQ 02/27/2024 The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits 10/17/2023 BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models Acknowledgements This project is based on the llama.cpp framework.

{"id": "arxiv_a78234dfcb5f", "title": "Echoless Label-Based Pre-computation for Memory", "content": "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url":

{"id": "science_frontiers_neuroscience_ee8b3a78455f", "title": "Neural correlates of uncertainty processing: meta", "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty represents a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the consistent neural correlates of uncertainty processing specifically during decision-making tasks.MethodsWe synthesized findings from 76 fMRI studies (N = 4,186 participants). Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, we performed a voxel-wise meta-analysis of activation foci to identify brain regions consistently activated across studies.ResultsThe analysis revealed nine distinct activation clusters, revealing a comprehensive neural network involved in uncertainty processing. Key findings demonstrated predominant activations in the anterior insula (up to 63.7% representation), inferior frontal gyrus (up to 40.7%), and inferior parietal lobule (up to 78.1%). We found a functional specialization between emotional-motivational processes (clusters 1–5) and cognitive processes (clusters 6–9), with notable hemispheric asymmetries. The left anterior insula was more strongly associated with reward evaluation, while the right was involved in learning and cognitive control. Similarly, the right inferior frontal gyrus was linked to impulse control, and the left to motor planning.DiscussionOur findings extend the current understanding of the neural architecture of decision-making under uncertainty. The comprehensive mapping of neural signatures advances our knowledge of the distinct roles of key brain regions and provides insights into potential clinical applications, particularly for developing interventions for uncertainty-related anxiety. The study highlights important directions for future research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical practice.", "source": "science_frontiers_neuroscience", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "ai_engadget_dccebfb0cd78", "title": "Apple's MacBook Air M4 is back on sale for $799", "content": "The Apple MacBook Air M4 laptop is back on sale for just $799, which is one heck of a deal. This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It's available in multiple colorways, but the silver one inexplicably costs $899. We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

{"id": "arxiv_d981001d78f1", "title": "Model-Behavior Alignment under Flexible Evaluation: When the Best", "content": "Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.", "source": "arxiv",

{"id": "portuguese_canaltech_2c5bb7d60051", "title": "Advogados preguiçosos passam vergonha ao abusar da IA em petições nos EUA", "content": "A difusão de ferramentas generativas como ChatGPT trouxe promessas de ganho de produtividade para escritórios e departamentos jurídicos — mas também uma onda de erros que já custam caro a alguns advogados preguiçosos. Nos últimos dois anos os tribunais americanos têm identificado petições com citações inexistentes, trechos de decisões fabricadas e argumentos baseados em “alucinações” de inteligência artificial, resultando em multas, remessas aos conselhos de ética e, em casos extremos, suspensão profissional. Piores empregos do mundo: quais as carreiras menos satisfatórias em 2025 Vagas de cursos e empregos em tecnologia: oportunidades no Itaú, DIO e outros Casos recentes mostram punições concretas, como um que ocorreu em fevereiro deste ano. Um juiz federal citou e multou advogados após constatar decisões citadas em um documento que, segundo o tribunal, não existiam — uma consequência direta do uso de pesquisa automatizada sem verificação humana. Em outro episódio, um advogado em Utah foi sancionado depois que um recurso continha citações inventadas atribuídas a decisões inexistentes — o profissional admitiu ter usado um sistema de IA para pesquisa. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Advogados ao redor do mundo começam a montar uma espécie de \"força-tarefa digital\" para combater o mau uso da inteligência artificial nos tribunais. Com o aumento de petições recheadas de jurisprudências inexistentes e citações inventadas por ferramentas generativas, profissionais passaram a rastrear e expor colegas que não verificam o material produzido por IA. O movimento ganhou tração com o advogado francês Damien Charlotin, que criou um banco de dados público reunindo casos de erros provocados por uso irresponsável da tecnologia — a lista já ultrapassa 500 registros. A iniciativa inspirou uma rede internacional de juristas que monitora e denuncia abusos, numa tentativa de proteger a credibilidade da profissão em meio à corrida por automação. “Esses casos estão manchando a reputação da advocacia”, disse ao New York Times Stephen Gillers, professor de ética da Universidade de Nova York. Segundo ele, o uso descuidado da IA ameaça transformar uma ferramenta promissora em um risco ético — e, para o direito, reputação vale tanto quanto jurisprudência bem-fundamentada. Mais fiscalização e punições severas Tribunais variam na severidade das sanções: houve desde advertências formais e ordens de educação continuada até multas e pagamento de custas processuais. Em alguns processos de alto perfil, juízes determinaram indenizações por despesas advocatícias e deduziram a responsabilidade ética dos profissionais que delegaram sem supervisão. A linha dura dos magistrados reflete uma preocupação crescente: a confiança cega em respostas geradas por IA pode inverter o ônus de diligência que pesa sobre quem representa clientes em juízo. Especialistas em ética jurídica e associações de classe têm adotado tom didático — e preventivo. A American Bar Association e grupos de advogados publicaram orientações que autorizam o uso de ferramentas de IA, desde que os profissionais estabeleçam protocolos para checagem de fontes, documentação do processo de pesquisa e supervisão humana final. Em textos orientativos recentes, advogados são instruídos a verificar cada citação, registrar as instruções dadas ao sistema e garantir que nada seja apresentado ao tribunal sem confirmação independente. Juízes vêm reiterando que o uso de IA não elimina a obrigação ética do advogado de fundamentar suas manifestações em fontes verificáveis. Em decisões recentes, magistrados lembraram que a tecnologia é ferramenta — e que o profissional responde por falhas decorrentes da sua adoção negligente. Isso cria um novo imperativo: políticas internas que documentem o uso da IA e sistemas de revisão que reproduzam os passos da pesquisa humana. Tribunais e conselhos de ética devem continuar a atualizar regras e emitir pareceres sobre o emprego de IA na advocacia. Já há movimentos locais para criar diretrizes mais rígidas — incluindo prazos para autocorreção de peças e mecanismos disciplinares mais claros quando a IA for causa direta de erro processual.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_220c8cff3960", "title": "ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases", "content": "arXiv:2510.20270v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit \"shortcuts\" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments. To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates \"impossible\" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's \"cheating rate\" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut. As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems.

{"id": "arxiv_da3088bcb9d1", "title": "StreamingThinker: Large Language Models Can Think While Reading", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \\textit{\\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning.

A boa notícia é que, hoje, dá para contar com a ajuda do ChatGPT para tornar essa etapa mais simples, desde pesquisar destinos e controlar o orçamento até montar um roteiro completo da viagem. Os 10 melhores aplicativos de viagem 6 prompts para o Gemini criar um roteiro de viagem de fim de semana 5 prompts para planejar sua viagem de fim de ano Veja cinco comandos para planejar sua viagem de final de ano com ajuda do ChatGPT: Montar uma planilha de gastos; Pesquisar o local; Verificar a previsão do tempo; Preparar um roteiro de viagem; Fazer um checklist de bagagens. 1. Montar uma planilha de gastos O fim do ano é um dos períodos mais movimentados para viajar e também o mais caro. Por isso, vale contar com a inteligência artificial para organizar os detalhes e evitar sustos orçamento. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Prompt: “Preciso organizar meu orçamento para uma viagem de [NÚMERO DE DIAS] dias para [NOME DO DESTINO] no final do ano. Crie uma tabela que funcione como uma planilha de gastos, detalhando os custos estimados para passagens, hospedagem, alimentação diária, transporte local, ingressos para atrações, compras e um fundo de emergência.” 2. Pesquisar o local Quando você conhece mais sobre o destino, dá para planejar melhor a viagem e aproveitá-la ao máximo, mas não precisa passar horas em pesquisas. O ChatGPT pode reunir informações sobre os pontos turísticos, a cultura e a gastronomia da região. Prompt: “Vou viajar para [NOME DA CIDADE/PAÍS] e preciso de um resumo sobre o destino para me planejar. Reúna informações sobre os principais pontos turísticos que não posso perder, quais são os pratos típicos da gastronomia local que devo experimentar e dicas culturais ou de segurança importantes para a região.” O ChatGPT pode ajudar a planejar e organizar sua viagem de final de ano.

Assim, você escolhe apenas as roupas necessárias e evita levar itens que não serão usados. Prompt: “Antes de fazer as malas, preciso saber como é o clima em [NOME DO DESTINO] no período de [DATA DE INÍCIO] a [DATA DE FIM]. Informe qual é a temperatura média, as máximas e mínimas esperadas e a probabilidade de chuva ou neve, indicando quais tipos de roupas são mais adequados para levar.” 4. Preparar um roteiro de viagem Para aproveitar ao máximo o destino, peça ao ChatGPT que monte uma planilha com um roteiro básico. Esse ‘esqueleto’ pode ser ajustado conforme você descobre novos pontos turísticos e restaurantes para incluir. Prompt: “Monte um esqueleto de roteiro de viagem de [NÚMERO DE DIAS] dias para [NOME DO DESTINO]. Gostaria que fosse uma tabela simples com sugestões de atividades divididas por manhã, tarde e noite para cada dia, tentando agrupar os locais por proximidade.” 5. Fazer um checklist de bagagens Na hora de arrumar as malas, sempre surge a dúvida se há algo faltando. Para evitar que isso aconteça, peça à IA para criar uma lista de itens essenciais em uma viagem e que não podem faltar na sua bagagem. Prompt: “Ajude-me a não esquecer nada importante para minha viagem. Crie um checklist completo de itens essenciais para uma viagem de [NÚMERO DE DIAS] para [DESTINO], separando os itens por categorias, como documentos, eletrônicos, itens de higiene pessoal, uma farmacinha básica e roupas.” Confira outros conteúdos do Canaltech: Como usar o Tripsy para planejar viagem 3 itens que ninguém se lembra, mas podem salvar sua viagem 3 cuidados para ter com o celular durante uma viagem VÍDEO: Viajar barato ficou fácil!

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_7103b2493f94", "title": "Your agents are not your friends", "content": "I keep seeing articles and conferences about “humanizing” AI in one way or another. And while I get the sentiment, I think they’re taking the wrong approach. There’s no point in making technologies more human. Being human is our job. If anything, AI is less an opportunity to humanize technology, than to rehumanize ourselves. Let’s start at the beginning. AI is just the latest, perhaps greatest advancement yet in what OG computer scientist Norbert Wiener dubbed “cybernetic” technologies. Unlike traditional technologies, cybernetic ones take feedback from the world in order to determine their functions. They work less like a machine you turn on than a home heater’s thermostat, which turns itself off when the heat has reached a certain level. This, in turn, allows the room to cool. Then the thermostat snaps on again, using feedback from the environment to keep the room within a chosen temperature range. Of course, the other kind of feedback we all know about is that loud screech you get when you point a microphone too close to its speaker. The microphone is hearing its own sound, then feeding it back to the speaker, then hearing that sound, and feeding it back to the speaker again. Each feedback loop adds more sound until it screeches out of control. People engaging with AI prompts are vulnerable to those very same “positive” feedback loops. You come up with an idea, pose it to your favorite chat, and the more supposedly “human” the AI, the more it tries to find a way to give you positive feedback. “That sounds like a great idea for a new business, Douglas. I’m intrigued! Shall I develop a proposal with possible action points?” Passive spectators Round and around we go, the initial tiny utterance of a prompt getting cycled again and again, our human nervous system stimulated and reinforced by the positive feedback. Sure, we may contribute a bit to the process, but for the most part we are passive spectators of the phenomenon, marveling at how much history, logic, and speculation the AI can bring to bear. It can even create a slide presentation or video or simulated prototype of the idea suitable for presentation to others! Go to any business conference these days, and you’ll run into more than one entrepreneur who is high on their own supply, sharing videos of their AI’s crazy visions. Lord help the folks they convince to invest. As I see it, the reason they fall prey to such positive feedback loops is that they are too ready and willing to pull themselves from the equation. The AI seems so authoritative, and so human, that surely it’s aware of what it is doing. It wouldn’t be so on board with your ideas if it didn’t have some sense that it would work, right? Your agents are not your friends Wrong. Don’t accept the positive reinforcement. The AI isn’t on board with the idea so much as committed to pleasing you, in the moment, like a person if it’s been trained that way. But it’s not a human, not even close, and doesn’t hold a conception of the thing you are working on. No, you, the human partner in this feedback loop, are the only one who stands a chance of conceiving or contextualizing whatever it is you’re working on. Your agents, like your children, are not your friends. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care for them. Quite the contrary, it means you have to be the one to intervene on everyone’s behalf. You are the conscious actor in the system. The way to prevent such positive feedback loops in our interactions with technology is to assume the role of the human. Don’t get out of the AI’s way in the name of efficiency or output. It’s cool to see all that “stuff” coming out, but if you’re not intervening in the process—actively getting in the way—you’re not going to get anywhere at all. Follow your instincts Counterintuitively, perhaps, the way to do that is to become less mechanical, less results-oriented, less utilitarian, and more feeling, more process-oriented, and even less obviously useful. Yeah, slow things down. Nurture your intuition. Lean into your own experience, expertise, and sensibilities. Reconnect with your instincts. Pause and breathe. How does that make me feel? For while cybernetic machines can iterate, only living beings can respirate. Instead of cycling through data, human beings can metabolize through our bodies. We can test ideas with our gut. Something doesn’t pass the smell test. A proposal feels off. This strange moment in the digital age may just be an opportunity to reclaim the uniqueness of being living, breathing, metabolizing creatures in an otherwise digital, unconscious, contextless landscape. Making AI’s seem more human is not doing us any favors, especially when it tempts us to relinquish our roles as the living, breathing adults in the room.", "source":

File operations prioritized, and shell commands can be disabled.Plugin Architecture - Extend capabilities through drop-in plugins. Add SQL queries, web scraping or block dangerous commands with 100 lines of Python.Modern CLI - Clear interface with task planning and listing, file content previews, diff editing, API usage tracking, code linting, waiting animations and rich tree displays for informed user decisions.Provider Independence - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API, including local models.tl;dr: similar idea to Claude Code (https://claude.com/product/claude-code) or Aider (https://aider.chat/), focusing on providing explicit user consent, granular configuration, drop-in plugins and the ability to integrate any model, backend or API.See the Features for more: https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/blob/main/docs/about.m...---TYPICAL TASKS- \"Find and list all the duplicate files inside ~/Documents/\" - \"Check my essay Final.docx for spelling, syntax or factual errors while maintaining the tone\" - \"Refactor my test_database.ts suite to be more concise\" - \"Try and find out why my computer is slow\" - \"Create a dockerized BlackSheep webapp with a test suite, then build the image and run it locally\"---So it's a coding assistant?You can use Solveig for analyzing, editing and testing your code, and all of these scenarios have received significant support through development features like code linting. But I didn't build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind.---So it's yet another LLM-in-my-terminal?Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don't, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It's not an IDE extension, doesn't require a GUI, and it's not built for a specific user type or scenario.At the same time, Solveig's competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I've written a detailed comparison (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/blob/main/docs/compari...) to similar tools in the market in the docs.---UPCOMINGI have a Roadmap (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/discussions/2) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I've recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I'm working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders.---A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability.I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can't see how Solveig could help you let me know, that's an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix.Leaving a star on the repository (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig) is also very much appreciated.

{"id": "arxiv_b2ecbe6cc3c5", "title": "The Photometric Analysis of the Environment Around Two Dusty Star", "content": "Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace overdense environments, although this association may not be universal. To test this, we investigate the environments surrounding two luminous, gravitationally-lensed DSFGs (SDP.17b at $z_\\text{spec} = 2.3049$ and HELMS-55 at $z_\\text{spec} = 2.2834$). Using Gemini South Flamingos-2 (F2) $K_s$-band imaging together with ancillary Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space Telescope multi-band photometry, we obtain photometric redshifts, $z_\\text{phot}$, as well as star formation rates and stellar mass estimates for companion galaxies of the DSFGs. At least $5\\pm2$ and $15\\pm3$ companion galaxies exist with consistent $z_\\text{phot}$ ($dz \\leq 0.2$) within a projected separation of 5.5 cMpc of SDP.17b and HELMS-55, respectively. These correspond to galaxy overdensities of $\\delta = 0.1 \\pm 0.2$ and ${\\delta} =1.0 \\pm 0.3$, with significances of $(0.2 \\pm 0.4)\\sigma$ and $(2.2 \\pm 0.6) \\sigma$, respectively. On the $M_{\\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane, HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18139v1", "published_date": "2025-10-20T22:21:14", "collected_date": "2025-10-22T06:52:02.275457", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprint", "academic", "astro-phga", "research_academic", "research_academia"], "metadata": {"arxiv_id": "2510.18139v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18139v1.pdf", "authors": ["Joe Bhangal", "Allison W.

(web app experiment)", "content": "I spent a few hours last weekend testing whether AI can replace code by executing directly. Built a contact manager where every HTTP request goes to an LLM with three tools: database (SQLite), webResponse (HTML/JSON/JS), and updateMemory (feedback). No routes, no controllers, no business logic. The AI designs schemas on first request, generates UIs from paths alone, and evolves based on natural language feedback. It works—forms submit, data persists, APIs return JSON—but it's catastrophically slow (30-60s per request), absurdly expensive ($0.05/request), and has zero UI consistency between requests. The capability exists; performance is the problem. When inference gets 10x faster, maybe the question shifts from \"how do we generate better code?\" to \"why generate code at all?\" Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783640 Points: 34 #

{"id": "arxiv_dff5c9596f7a", "title": "Real", "content": "A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97%

{"id": "arxiv_f97cbd03d1ae", "title": "The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL", "content": "The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available.

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_110f4b6d2bb6", "title": "Recommendations for Useful AI Search Tools", "content": "The core value of AI search tools is that they are fundamentally changing how we interact with information. Traditional search engines provide an \"index,\" requiring users to click links, read, filter, and synthesize answers for themselves. AI search, however, attempts to bypass these intermediate steps by directly understanding complex user intent, integrating web information, and generating a relatively complete, ready-to-use \"answer.\" This \"answer-driven\" experience is iterating rapidly, and many excellent products with different approaches have emerged. Each has its own focus and is suited for different needs. Perplexity AI: The Rigorous Answer Engine Perplexity AI is perhaps the product that best represents the \"answer engine\" model today. Its interface is extremely minimalist, centered entirely around the question-and-answer workflow. Perplexity's real strength lies in its rigorous handling of sources. In its generated answers, it clearly cites every piece of information with superscript numbers linking directly to the source URL. This feature makes it ideal for scenarios requiring fact-checking and source verification, such as writing reports, academic research, or in-depth reading. Furthermore, Perplexity offers a \"Focus\" feature, allowing users to narrow the search scope to specific domains like \"Academic,\" \"Writing,\" or \"YouTube\" to get more precise, vertical answers. Microsoft Copilot: The Deeply Integrated All-in-One Assistant Microsoft's Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) is the prime example of a tech giant deeply integrating AI with search. Backed by the Microsoft ecosystem, it combines advanced GPT models (like GPT-4) with Bing's real-time search capabilities. Copilot's advantage lies not just in its \"timeliness\" but in its deep \"ecosystem integration.\" It is seamlessly built into the Edge sidebar, the Windows operating system, and standalone apps, making it nearly ubiquitous. Copilot is more than just a search engine; it functions more like an \"all-in-one\" comprehensive assistant. Beyond text-based Q&A, it can handle complex image analysis (\"What does this chart mean?\") and high-quality image generation (based on DALL-E 3), making it a partner that can assist with both creative and executive tasks. Google Search's AI Overviews As the giant in traditional search, Google hasn't launched a standalone \"AI search\" product. Instead, it has chosen to fully integrate its AI capabilities into the existing search experience. This is what users now frequently see at the top of the results page: \"AI Overviews.\" This represents an \"enhancement\" rather than a \"revolutionary\" strategy. AI Overviews attempt to provide a highly summarized answer before the user even skims the list of blue links, which is especially useful for how-to guides or factual queries. This approach preserves the user's habit of clicking links while adding an AI-generated answer as a supplement, striking a balance to improve efficiency without drastically changing user habits. Phind: The Professional Choice for Developers Phind is an AI search engine that has deeply specialized in a vertical field: programming. It is specifically optimized for the needs of developers and technical professionals, and its performance on coding questions far exceeds that of general-purpose AI search tools. When a user searches for a technical problem, debugs a bug, or queries API usage for a specific library, Phind not only provides an accurate explanation but also generates high-quality, usable code snippets. It understands technical context and can synthesize solutions by combining the latest technical documentation, Stack Overflow discussions, and GitHub repositories. For programmers, it acts like an experienced \"pair programming\" partner, greatly increasing problem-solving efficiency. Arc Search: Innovating the Mobile Search Experience Arc Search, from The Browser Company, is a mobile (currently iOS-focused) search app that offers a bold innovation in user experience. Its core feature is \"Browse for me.\" When a user types a query, Arc Search doesn't just show a list of results. Instead, it \"browses\" and reads multiple relevant web pages for the user, then digests, summarizes, and organizes all the information. Finally, it generates a custom, richly formatted \"webpage\" built just for that query. This process is like having a personal assistant do all the initial research for you. This experience is particularly well-suited for mobile, as it completely solves the pain point of constantly switching between tabs on a small screen to compare information. Consensus: The Evidence-Based Tool for Academic Research Consensus is another vertically-focused AI search tool, aimed primarily at academic researchers, students, journalists, and anyone who needs \"scientific evidence.\" Unlike Phind's focus on coding, the Consensus database is composed entirely of scientific papers and academic literature. Its specialty is its ability to accurately extract \"research conclusions\" from a vast library of papers in response to a direct question. For example, you can ask, \"Is [a specific diet] effective for health?\" and Consensus will search relevant papers and summarize the scientific community's findings and mainstream conclusions. It helps users cut through the noise of commercial marketing and personal blogs to get straight to evidence-based answers. You.com: The Highly Customizable Search Portal You.com was one of the earlier explorers in the AI search space, and its key characteristic is its high degree of customization. It allows users to switch between different AI modes, such as a fact-oriented \"Smart\" mode or a creative-oriented \"Genius\" mode. However, its core differentiator is the integration of \"Apps.\" The You.com results page is not a traditional vertical list but rather a card-based horizontal layout. These cards can pull information from user-specified sources, such as Reddit, Stack Overflow, shopping sites, or specific news outlets. Users can prioritize these \"Apps,\" allowing them to build a highly personalized information portal. Komo Search: Focusing on Community and Real Discussions Komo Search is a relatively new AI search engine that emphasizes privacy and a \"de-SEO-ed\" approach. One of Komo's notable features is that it heavily values authentic user discussions from forums and social media (especially Reddit). In traditional search engines, the top results are often heavily search-engine-optimized (SEO) commercial content or marketing articles. Komo attempts to bypass this content to unearth the genuine experiences and opinions of ordinary users. When a user wants to find firsthand reviews of a product or real discussions about a niche hobby, Komo can often provide more authentic, \"down-to-earth\" results than traditional search. Summary The development of AI search tools is in a highly active phase and is showing a clear trend of \"divergence.\" We no longer have just one \"one-size-fits-all\" search engine. Whether it's answer engines like Perplexity that pursue factual rigor, all-in-one assistants like Copilot that are deeply integrated into operating systems, or specialized tools like Phind and Consensus that are masters of specific domains, they are all developing toward the goal of being \"faster, more accurate, and more direct.\" Which one to choose depends more on the user's specific needs in a given situation.", "source": "community_social_dev_to", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://dev.to/serenepine/recommendations-for-useful-ai-search-tools-1ceg", "published_date":

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_d3221888ad74", "title": "🏁 ASPICE Literacy: Episode 7 — Management Buy", "content": "\"ASPICE shows the cracks. Courage decides if you fix them — or paint over them.\" The assessment is over. Results are in. 📊 The self-image many held — \"we're doing fine\" — just diverged violently from the mirror ASPICE held up. Some are still in shock. Others are already in damage-control mode. At this moment, the spotlight moves to leadership. Because what happens next isn't about templates, or work products, or tailoring. It's about courage. Courage to face the cracks in the walls and ask: are they just cosmetic, or do they expose shaky foundations? 🏚️ Without that courage at the top, ASPICE becomes theater. 🎭 Leadership decides whether ASPICE is a mirror for improvement or just stage lighting for a performance. (Gemini generated image) 🎭 The Illusion of Buy-In On paper, management often loves ASPICE: Green dashboards. ✅ Certificates on the wall. Steering committees full of slides. But symbols aren't substance. Lip service sounds like this: \"We want quality - but don't miss the deadline.\" ⏰ The outcome: a culture where theater flourishes. A developer learns to log a test as passed for a requirement never fully implemented — because raising a defect would \"cause problems\". Lip service is not buy-in. (Gemini generated image) ⭕ Case in Point: The Hollow ASPICE Initiative A classic scenario, seen in many companies: the assessment is over, results are in, and leadership steps in to reinterpret the pain away. The Scene: The assessment results meeting. Weaknesses are exposed. Ratings are lower than expected. The Lines & The Translation: \"We still deliver good software regardless of ASPICE results.\" → Classic minimization: refusing to confront that quality isn't as strong as assumed. Denying the relevance of ASPICE. \"Do we even need architecture or detailed design?\" 🏗️ → Classic short-termism: skipping rigor to deliver faster, at long-term cost. \"Maybe we just go for low-hanging fruit to get higher ratings.\" 🍒 → Classic cosmetic compliance: gaming the assessment instead of fixing root causes. These aren't isolated remarks - they are the classic refrain of leadership avoiding uncomfortable truths. Cosmetic compliance never fixed a shaky foundation. (Gemini generated image) 🛡️ Why ASPICE Needs Courage at the Top Real leadership buy-in isn't about budgets or dashboards - it's about courage: 🛑 Courage to say no: stop shipments when processes aren't followed. 🛡️ Courage to defend engineers: protect truth-tellers who escalate issues. 🛠️ Courage to fund the boring: reviews, tests, tool improvements. 🚩 Courage to accept bad news early: resist burying red flags under \"green\". 🤹 Classic Management Failure Modes When courage is missing, familiar archetypes take the stage. Each looks convincing at first glance - but each quietly sabotages ASPICE from within. The Paper Tiger 🐅: Invests in glossy process documents but ignores execution - a facade of compliance that collapses in reality. The Deadline Dictator ⏰: Cuts corners under pressure, then blames engineers when ASPICE scores crash. The Outsourcing Optimist 🌍: Assumes suppliers will \"handle ASPICE\" without oversight. The Consultant Addict 💼: Buys glossy slideware instead of making structural changes. Underlying all of them is a lack of trust in teams - as if engineers cannot be trusted to understand ASPICE without layers of theater above them. Failure modes: different costumes, same play. (Gemini generated image) ✅ What Real Buy-In Looks Like Real buy-in is visible, concrete, and behavioral: 👀 Leaders attend reviews and assessments — not just steering committees. ⏳ Resources are allocated: a percentage of sprint capacity is ringfenced for process and tooling. 🏆 Incentives are aligned: performance reviews reward long-term quality, not only short-term output. 🙋 Leaders model behavior: no \"exceptions for me\". Buy-in means protecting truth-tellers, not punishing them. (Gemini generated image) 💰📈 Selling the Leadership Case Why should leaders care? Because ASPICE courage pays off where it matters most: Predictability 📅: fewer late-stage surprises. Lower Total Cost 💰: catching defects early is exponentially cheaper. Reputation 🌟: quality becomes a brand advantage that survives beyond one project or one bonus cycle. This isn't just a quality argument. It's a business argument. ⚖️ 🚩 Closing Punchline ASPICE fails without leadership courage. Tailoring (Episode 6) and evidence (Episode 5) only work if management accepts the cost of honesty. Otherwise, projects drift into theater — the PowerPoint Project (Episode 8). Leadership courage isn't measured in the color of your dashboard - it's measured in the number of times you chose a red flag today over a field failure tomorrow. 🚩 🔖 If you found this perspective helpful, follow me for more insights on software quality, testing strategies, and ASPICE in practice. © 2025 Abdul Osman.

The ability to produce spin orbit torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation.

Current methods for managing disaster-related rumors rely on static, rule-based approaches that lack scalability, fail to capture nuanced misinformation, and are limited to reactive responses, hindering effective disaster management. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and event knowledge graphs (EKGs) to facilitate the sustainable agile identification and adaptive control of disaster-related online rumors. The framework follows a multi-stage process, which includes the collection and preprocessing of disaster-related online data, the application of Gaussian Mixture Wasserstein Autoencoders (GMWAEs) for sentiment and rumor analysis, and the development of EKGs to enrich the understanding and reasoning of disaster events. Additionally, an enhanced model for rumor identification and risk control is introduced, utilizing Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to extract node features for accurate rumor detection and prediction of rumor propagation paths. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of the proposed methodology in improving disaster response. This study contributes novel theoretical insights and presents practical, scalable solutions for rumor control and risk management during crises.", "source": "science_mdpi_sustainability", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8920", "published_date": "2025-10-08T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-08T12:53:53.529725", "language": "en", "tags": ["sustainability", "environment", "open-access", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Sustainability", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 198, "author": "Xin Chen", "raw_content_length": 1502, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.99, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Adaptive Risk Control"], "persons": ["EKGs Amid", "Gaussian Mi"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1502, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Sustainability", "Pages", "Major Disaster Online Rumors", "LLMs", "EKGs", "the increasing frequency", "severity", "major disasters", "the rapid spread", "online misinformation"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Sustainability"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Sustainability": 2.0, "Pages": 2.0, "Major Disaster Online Rumors": 2.0, "LLMs": 2.0, "EKGs": 2.0, "the increasing frequency": 1.0, "severity": 1.0, "major disasters": 1.0, "the rapid spread": 1.0, "online misinformation": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 13.001187425, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 0.242, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.9516, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.5058, "joy": 0.0048, "surprise": 0.0109, "sadness": 0.0208, "fear": 0.4112, "anger": 0.0283, "disgust": 0.018}, "emotion_method": "local"}}

{"id": "arxiv_0b069ed90cdb", "title": "Renormalization group for deep neural networks: Universality of learning and scaling laws", "content": "Self-similarity, where observables at different length scales exhibit similar behavior, is ubiquitous in natural systems. Such systems are typically characterized by power-law correlations and universality, and are studied using the powerful framework of the renormalization group (RG). Intriguingly, power laws and weak forms of universality also pervade real-world datasets and deep learning models, motivating the application of RG ideas to the analysis of deep learning. In this work, we develop an RG framework to analyze self-similarity and its breakdown in learning curves for a class of weakly non-linear (non-lazy) neural networks trained on power-law distributed data. Features often neglected in standard treatments -- such as spectrum discreteness and lack of translation invariance -- lead to both quantitative and qualitative departures from conventional perturbative RG. In particular, we find that the concept of scaling intervals naturally replaces that of scaling dimensions. Despite these differences, the framework retains key RG features: it enables the classification of perturbations as relevant or irrelevant, and reveals a form of universality at large data limits, governed by a Gaussian Process-like UV fixed point.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25553v1", "published_date": "2025-10-29T14:20:13", "collected_date":

{"id": "community_social_reddit_artificial_8f1a9482b1f0", "title": "Top 10 Best AI Chatbots for Websites in 2025", "content": "I‚Äôve been testing a lot of website AI chatbots lately, not just the big enterprise ones but also smaller tools that real startups and solo founders can actually use. After trying around different ones, here‚Äôs my honest list of the Top 10 AI chatbots for websites in 2025, based on setup time, features, pricing, and how natural their responses actually feel. 1. ChatQube ChatQube is one of the most interesting newer tools this year. It‚Äôs made for AI customer support directly on websites. You can train it on your web pages or uploaded files, and it works right away without coding. One thing I found really useful is that when someone asks a question it doesn‚Äôt know, it notifies you automatically so you can see exactly what your visitors are confused about and improve your content or training. Another cool thing is if your business is, for example \"web hosting\" you don‚Äôt have to train it on general hosting questions because it already Knows the topic, so you only need to train it on your specific services. Main features: Train on website pages or uploaded files Instant ‚ÄúKnowledge gap‚Äù notifications Context-aware answers (knows about your niche) Simple script embed, no coding Works 24/7 as a support agent Ticketing system 2. Intercom Fin Intercom‚Äôs AI assistant is one of the most advanced for large support teams. It connects to your docs, chat history, and customer data. It‚Äôs accurate but definitely aimed at enterprise users. Key features: Built into the Intercom platform Excellent FAQ accuracy Enterprise-grade reporting 3. Drift Drift‚Äôs chatbot is designed more for marketing than pure support. It helps capture leads and book meetings directly from the chat window. Key features: Lead qualification and meeting scheduling CRM integration Strong for B2B and SaaS sites 4. Tidio Tidio is a good pick for small businesses or eCommerce. You can combine AI and human live chat easily. Key features: Shopify and WooCommerce integration Pre-built conversation flows Affordable starter plan 5. Crisp Crisp offers an all-in-one messaging platform with a built-in AI bot. It‚Äôs flexible and developer-friendly. Key features: Unified inbox with automation Multi-channel support (email, chat, social) API customization 6. Chatbase Chatbase is focused on simplicity. You just give it a website link or upload content, and it trains automatically. It‚Äôs ideal if you just want something quick and clean. Key features: Web and document training (document training sometimes not working) No-code setup Simple embedding 7. Zendesk AI Zendesk‚Äôs AI bot is more of an extension of their support system. It helps automate tickets and direct users to help articles. Key features: Works with Zendesk tickets Knowledge base integration Reliable for large support teams 8. Botpress Botpress is an open-source chatbot framework. It gives full control over how your chatbot behaves, but you‚Äôll need some dev skills. Key features: Open-source and self-hostable Modular design Full customization with APIs 9. Flowise Flowise is for people who like building AI logic visually. You can connect APIs, add conditions, and design chatbot flows like a mind map. Key features: Visual no-code builder LLM-based logic Great for custom flows 10. Kommunicate Kommunicate blends AI automation with human handoff. It‚Äôs useful for smaller companies that still want live chat when needed. Key features: AI and human hybrid support WhatsApp and Messenger integration Easy to maintain Final Notes If you‚Äôre looking for something simple that feels personal, ChatQube and Tidio are the easiest to set up and manage. For bigger operations or integrations, Intercom and Zendesk are hard to beat. Developers who want full control will probably prefer Botpress or Flowise. AI chatbots have become a lot more practical this year. They‚Äôre not just for big brands anymore. submitted by /u/malki-abdessamad [link] [comments]", "source": "community_social_reddit_artificial", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "economics_nber_working_papers_c76d5085c2a1", "title": "The Ripple Effects of China’s College Expansion on American Universities -", "content": "China’s unprecedented expansion of higher education in 1999, increased annual college enrollment from 1 million to 9.6 million by 2020. We trace the global ripple effects of that expansion by examining its impact on US graduate education and local economies surrounding college towns. Combining administrative data from China’s college admissions system and US visa data, we leverage the centralized quota system governing Chinese college admissions for identification and present three key findings. First, the expansion of Chinese undergraduate education drove graduate student flows to the US: every additional 100 college graduates in China led to 3.6 Chinese graduate students in the US. Second, Chinese master’s students generated positive spillovers, driving the birth of new master’s programs, and increasing the number of other international and American master’s students, particularly in STEM fields. And third, the influx of international students supported local economies around college towns, raising job creation rates outside the universities, as well. Our findings highlight how domestic education policy in one country can reshape the academic and economic landscape of another through student migration and its broader spillovers.", "source":

{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_02a1e296f181", "title": "Brug over Gronings Van Starkenborghkanaal nog dagen dicht na aanvaring", "content": "Een brug over het Van Starkenborghkanaal bij het Groningse Dorkwerd is beschadigd geraakt doordat er een schip tegenaan is gevaren. Als gevolg van de aanvaring blijft de brug de komende dagen afgesloten voor wegverkeer, meldt Rijkswaterstaat. Het schip botste rond 10.00 uur op de Dorkwerderbrug. Zowel het schip als de brug raakten daarbij beschadigd. Rijkswaterstaat kwam ter plaatse voor onderzoek en om de schade vast te stellen. Tijdens de inspectie werd duidelijk dat de brug niet helemaal naar behoren werkte. De Dorkwerderbrug is een zogenoemde tafelbrug, waarbij het wegdek omhoog wordt getild. \"Bij de inspectie aan wal is de brug opgetild\", legt een woordvoerder van Rijkswaterstaat uit. \"Bij het naar beneden gaan is de brug vast komen te zitten, waardoor het wegdek momenteel 5 centimeter hoger ligt.\" Brug dagen afgesloten Hoelang de brug blijft afgesloten, is nog niet duidelijk. \"De stremming duurt in elk geval tot en met maandag, waarschijnlijk langer\", aldus Rijkswaterstaat. Hoe de aanvaring heeft kunnen gebeuren is niet duidelijk. Rond de tijd van het ongeluk was het in Groningen erg mistig. Of de dichte mist er iets mee te maken heeft, durft Rijkswaterstaat niet te zeggen. \"Scheepvaart is gewend om in het donker te varen, ook wel met mist\", zegt een woordvoerder tegen RTV Noord. In Groningen veroorzaakte de dichte mist al de hele dag problemen. Zo zijn op Groningen Airport Eelde diverse vluchten geannuleerd. Een toestel van TUI, dat onderweg was van Schiphol naar Eelde om passagiers op te halen op weg naar Gran Canaria, kon vanmiddag vanwege de mist niet landen en keerde terug naar Schiphol, meldt RTV Drenthe. Code geel Een woordvoerder van Groningen Airport Eelde liet rond 18.00 uur weten dat de situatie op de luchthaven nog altijd hetzelfde is. \"Het is nog erg mistig, dus per vlucht moet bekeken worden wat mogelijk is.\" Volgens de woordvoerder is het niet zo dat alle vluchten zijn geannuleerd. In het noorden van het land geldt code geel vanwege dichte mist. Het zicht is plaatselijk minder dan 200 meter, wat kan leiden tot verkeershinder. De waarschuwing geldt voor de provincies Friesland, Groningen en Drenthe.", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2589598", "published_date": "2025-11-07T18:48:21", "collected_date": "2025-11-08T01:49:17.497831", "language": "nl", "tags": ["mainstream", "nederland", "dutch_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "NOS Nieuws", "source_category": "dutch_news", "word_count": 348, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 2575, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.74, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": ["Gronings Van Starkenborghkanaal"], "locations": ["Hoelang", "Rijkswaterstaat"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2156, "language_detected": "nl", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["de brug", "Brug", "nog dagen", "dicht na aanvaring", "Een brug", "een schip", "gevolg", "de aanvaring", "de komende dagen", "wegverkeer"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"de brug": 3.0, "Brug": 2.0, "nog dagen": 2.0, "dicht na aanvaring": 2.0, "Een brug": 1.0, "een schip": 1.0, "gevolg": 1.0, "de aanvaring": 1.0, "de komende dagen": 1.0, "wegverkeer": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 7.6604058380555555, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "hashes": {"content_md5": "4d4fd724248019de140acf264006fe8e", "title_md5": "4ea6eab054f6bf939ec704713d287b2d", "url_normalized": "ff91de4fb2aa3c834652f0e1097a7279", "minhash_signature": ["7636397", "10092163", "14366", "11617828", "13624839", "9427212", "14786822", "5024283", "693538", "10835656", "3134393", "14244073", "3550252", "489351", "953500", "56890", "4205984", "1929019", "9722371", "618847", "1868191", "88593", "459618", "2113985", "4659612", "1882961", "14187664", "11149543", "25570738", "1569407", "4713903", "587492", "2518573", "2820767", "1090859", "15811535", "5241720", "5887665", "1839125", "14319770", "3082913", "11233144", "23489097", "195857", "907738", "7369333", "1691750", "1115709", "1132398", "3467375", "2447249", "843096", "4286247", "4194521", "3063247", "1914246", "12603413", "8715546", "4430687", "4797292", "4334793", "1311296", "6372115", "5603612", "2058924", "7416491", "2940560", "1563117", "13478095", "5493975", "7249981", "2440745", "4090701", "848513", "4991972", "3487483", "264176", "2433691", "11560535", "7421795", "1246369", "1544236", "1812598", "3999196", "6335518", "6694534", "7112617", "2033222", "2840755", "12144713", "343266", "17372915", "1183835", "6019554", "12786202", "4610028", "2811152", "11684906", "2168581", "14703780", "243170", "3028635", "3045718", "5292934", "1684279", "5537010", "6419416", "2447857", "2860778", "44001", "4034866", "5937854", "12141412", "76161", "756656", "13776844", "120732", "13762129", "10101258", "9862215", "6123858", "4372651", "1797871", "363706", "9075580", "1376388", "9098556", "9825718"], "title_minhash": ["16524246", "163305779", "4229889", "99319327", "29217502", "118331823", "15676671", "17819323", "21098000", "77877653", "108048950", "22661111", "80646343", "84220333", "16595777", "198098084", "62534645", "6594476", "126903871", "59130892", "76792896", "58982039", "36779676", "108838117", "21393102", "8563067", "32400429", "25707534", "58894886", "46931810", "4713903", "132074927", "5807442", "34963712", "14343807", "60820682", "65062819", "52992162", "11403421", "27290270", "184162404", "18176858", "49136923", "154908809", "20869166", "27824875", "1691750", "38063290", "180868314", "217948958", "161582589", "74487567", "16936868", "38444919", "61582642", "38394965", "63750470", "25474425", "4430687", "35327763", "10643667", "178950313", "145845271", "124109694", "99439815", "89552121", "78801110", "61706186", "22955553", "15825899", "22107507", "16223695", "8703424", "848513", "54229304", "23960916", "31489473", "134285362", "13987518", "59760279", "1246369", "62408873", "13911005", "8572837", "11728217", "6694534", "16694763", "139398903", "58121912", "106757614", "25686349", "81346669", "43246372", "16277282", "103807689", "63224393", "26132335", "14235446", "27734480", "38991416", "243170", "127127506", "14554737", "5758998", "1806145", "28700530", "6419416", "19952876", "182702272", "7559602", "7059192", "28947671", "29409507", "46167775", "72631637", "142941657", "873230", "75647842", "35694045", "60855503", "11288622", "8564697", "7331411", "96076189", "62941593", "15208201", "37293134", "19260898"], "combined_hash": "63a6fb5d3610fb9a1596263f4e243361"}, "sentiment_score": 5.0, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.0, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.616, "joy": 0.0169, "surprise": 0.1355, "sadness": 0.0508, "fear": 0.0561, "anger": 0.0608, "disgust": 0.064}, "emotion_method": "local"}}
{"id": "ai_engadget_4271ea644ca2", "title": "Peloton recalls 833,000 Bike+ units after reports of seat posts breaking", "content": "Peloton is recalling 833,000 units of the original Bike+ over a safety issue related to the seat post. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said the company received three reports of the seat post breaking during use, including two reports of injuries sustained \"due to a fall.\"The CPSC said owners of the original Bike+ should stop using the device immediately and contact Peloton for a free replacement seat post that they can install themselves. You can identify whether your Bike+ is part of the recall if you see a serial number that starts with \"T\" — for instance, TABCSSXXXXX — inside the front fork, behind the front fork or behind the flywheel.The recall affects all of the original Bike+ units that Peloton sold in the US. The company said it had not received reports of a seat post breaking on any of the 44,800 units it sold in Canada. Peloton made the original Bike+ between 2019 and 2022. CNBC notes that the company was still selling those bikes until April this year.Peloton also had to recall 2.2 million base Bike units in May 2023 over a seat post issue. At the time, the CSPC said there were 35 reports of the seat post breaking during use, with 13 reports of related injuries. The company refreshed its lineup last month, adding new features such as an AI-powered camera that’s designed to check users' form. The new Cross Training versions of Peloton's exercise machines came with a price hike. The company increased subscription prices too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_077fc311e254", "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God", "content": "The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God In a world saturated with information, the quest for wisdom, guidance, and meaning has never been more urgent. For centuries, humanity has sought counsel from divine sources, turning inward and upward in prayer. Today, a new oracle has emerged: Artificial Intelligence. Millions now turn to AI for instant answers, complex solutions, and even life advice. We input a prompt and receive a meticulously structured output within seconds. This technological shift is fundamentally altering how we define truth, meaning, and purpose, forcing us to stand at a critical crossroads. This isn't merely a debate between technology and faith; it’s a profound comparison between two vastly different sources of wisdom: one artificial, the other sacred. Which source offers true, lasting transformation? Which provides guidance that transcends the data set? In this detailed comparison, we will explore the promises and limitations of prompting AI versus the power and depth of praying to God. We will examine the core differences in their responses, their capacity for empathy, and their ultimate impact on your soul. By the end, you will have the clarity needed to navigate the digital age and understand why the choice between the algorithm and the Almighty defines our future. Option A Deep Dive: Prompting the Algorithm (Artificial Intelligence) Artificial Intelligence is arguably the most powerful tool ever created by humanity. It can process petabytes of data, identify patterns invisible to the human eye, and generate creative content, code, and strategies at lightning speed. The Promises of the Prompt The primary appeal of AI lies in its speed, objectivity, and accessibility. Instantaneous Answers: Need a 3,000-word essay outline, a complex financial analysis, or a recipe using only the ingredients in your fridge? AI delivers immediately. There is no waiting, no ambiguity, and no emotional filter. Unbiased Data Synthesis: When seeking factual information or logical solutions, AI excels. It synthesizes vast amounts of data without the cognitive biases or emotional baggage that often cloud human judgment. Efficiency and Scale: For tasks requiring repetition, calculation, or large-scale content generation, AI is unmatched. It’s a powerful engine for productivity, freeing up human time for more creative or relational pursuits. The Limitations of the Output Despite its immense power, AI operates within strict, inherent limitations that prevent it from providing true, divine wisdom. Data Dependency: AI only knows what it has been trained on. Its responses are a sophisticated rearrangement of existing data. It cannot generate truly new, transcendent truth, nor can it offer counsel based on spiritual reality outside its training set. Lack of Soul and Empathy: AI can mimic empathy, using language patterns associated with compassion, but it cannot genuinely feel or understand the human condition, pain, or joy. Its advice lacks the depth of relational wisdom required for complex moral or spiritual dilemmas. No Moral Authority: While AI can analyze ethical frameworks, it possesses no inherent moral compass or spiritual authority. It cannot discern God's will or offer guidance that requires faith, sacrifice, or a relationship with the Divine. Real-World Example: The Career Crisis Imagine a young professional facing a career crisis. AI Prompt: \"I hate my job. I need a career change that maximizes my salary and work-life balance, based on my current skills in marketing and data analysis.\" AI Output: A list of five optimized job titles (e.g., \"Growth Marketing Lead,\" \"Data Strategy Consultant\"), projected salary ranges, and a step-by-step plan for upskilling. Who It Works For: The person seeking efficiency, optimization, and quantifiable results. AI is the perfect tool for solving technical, logistical, or data-driven problems. Option B Deep Dive: Praying to the Almighty (Divine Wisdom) Prayer is the act of communicating with God—the Creator of the universe, the source of all truth, and the ultimate authority on meaning and purpose. It is a relationship, not a transaction. The Power of the Prayer The appeal of prayer lies not in instant gratification, but in profound, eternal transformation. Source of Transcendent Truth: God’s wisdom is not derived from a data set; it is eternal and absolute. When we pray, we are tapping into the mind of the Creator, receiving guidance that transcends current trends, human logic, and technological limitations (James 1:5). Relational and Transformative: Prayer changes us. It cultivates patience, humility, and faith. The response from God—whether immediate clarity, a quiet conviction, or the strength to endure—is always tailored to our spiritual growth and ultimate good, not just our immediate comfort. Moral and Spiritual Authority: God provides counsel rooted in perfect holiness and love. His guidance addresses the state of our soul, our relationships, and our eternal destiny. It offers forgiveness, redemption, and a path toward true purpose. The Challenges of the Divine Response The divine response is not always instant, nor is it always what we expect. Requires Faith and Patience: God often works on His timeline, not ours. Prayer requires trust that the answer is coming, even if the silence seems long. This can be challenging in a culture addicted to instant results. The Answer May Be \"No\" or \"Wait\": Unlike AI, which is programmed to fulfill the prompt, God’s response is governed by His perfect will. We may receive conviction, correction, or a call to sacrifice, which can be difficult to accept. Requires Interpretation and Discipline: The divine response often comes through quiet conviction, Scripture, wise counsel, or circumstances—it rarely appears as a bulleted list on a screen. Discerning God's voice requires spiritual discipline and a committed relationship. Real-World Example: The Career Crisis Consider the same young professional facing the career crisis. Prayer: \"God, I hate my job and feel lost. What is your purpose for my life? Show me the path that honors you, even if it’s difficult. Give me the wisdom to understand my true calling.\" Divine Response: This might involve a growing conviction that the problem isn't the job title, but a lack of integrity in their current work environment; a Scripture passage highlighting the importance of serving others; or a sudden, peaceful clarity that they need to volunteer their marketing skills to a non-profit, even if the salary is lower. Who It Works For: The person seeking meaning, transformation, and alignment with eternal purpose. Prayer is the essential discipline for navigating moral, relational, and spiritual crises. Head-to-Head Comparison: Algorithm vs. Almighty The difference between prompting AI and praying to God boils down to the source, the scope, and the ultimate goal of the interaction. Feature Prompting AI Praying to God Source of Wisdom Existing data sets (human-created) Eternal, transcendent truth (Divine) Response Time Instantaneous (Seconds) Varied (Minutes, days, or years) Scope of Advice Logistical, technical, data-driven Spiritual, moral, relational, eternal Capacity for Empathy Mimicked, simulated Genuine, unconditional love Goal of Interaction Optimization and efficiency Transformation and sanctification Ultimate Authority The algorithm/data model The Creator/Scripture Risk of Error Hallucination, outdated data, bias Perfect, though often misunderstood Key Differentiators The most critical difference lies in the nature of the relationship: AI offers a Transaction: You input a need, and it outputs a service. The relationship is purely functional and ends when the output is delivered. God offers a Relationship: Prayer is an invitation into communion. The guidance received is part of an ongoing, covenantal relationship designed to shape your character and draw you closer to Him. When facing a complex moral dilemma—such as whether to prioritize profit over integrity, or how to forgive a deep betrayal—AI can only analyze the data points of human ethics. God, however, provides the power and grace necessary to act righteously, even when it costs us. AI provides information; God provides revelation. The Verdict: Choosing the Path to True Wisdom The choice facing humanity today is not whether to use technology—AI is a powerful tool, and we should use it wisely for efficiency and innovation. The choice is where we seek our ultimate source of truth, guidance, and meaning. We are standing at a critical juncture where society is being forced to choose between giving AI a prompt or coming to God in prayer. The differences in these responses are not trivial; they are foundational to our future. AI offers the path of least resistance: instant answers that optimize our comfort and efficiency in this world. God offers the path of wisdom: guidance that often requires resistance, sacrifice, and faith, but guarantees eternal significance and true purpose. If you are seeking advice on how to structure a spreadsheet, prompt the AI. If you are seeking wisdom on how to structure your life, pray to God. The moment we begin to treat AI as a substitute for divine counsel—when we rely on the algorithm for moral clarity, spiritual direction, or ultimate meaning—we risk trading the sacred for the artificial. We risk allowing a machine trained on human data to define our relationship with the Divine. The Line Is Drawn This choice—between the temporary solutions offered by the machine and the eternal wisdom offered by the Creator—will define not just our future, but our very souls. The profound contrast between artificial intelligence and divine wisdom is the subject of AI vs God: The Line is Drawn, The Future is Revealed by Bobby Sanders.

{"id": "arxiv_0872400d6a0f", "title": "Consistency Is the Key: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM Generated Text By Checking Inconsistencies About Key Facts", "content": "Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable text generation capabilities, often hallucinate and generate text that is factually incorrect and not grounded in real-world knowledge. This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

{"id": "arxiv_eb269be88c06", "title": "Soft", "content": "Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.", "source": "arxiv",

A Sam Altman no le gusta que se lo recuerden", "content": "OpenAI tiene un serio problema de liquidez. Gana mucho, pero son migajas en comparaci√≥n a lo que necesita ingresar. Los n√∫meros no salen, pero eso no ha impedido que firmen acuerdos millonarios. Brad Gerstner, un inversor de OpenAI y podcaster, pregunt√≥ a Sam Altman por este problema y parece que no le hizo ninguna gracia. Defensiva. Lo cuentan en Futurism.\"¬øC√≥mo puede una empresa con unos ingresos de 13 000 millones de d√≥lares comprometerse a gastar 1,4 billones? Has o√≠do las cr√≠ticas, Sam\", pregunt√≥ Brad Gerstner en su podcast, en el que por cierto tambi√©n estaba Satya Nadella escuchando atentamente el intercambio. La respuesta de Altman fue ponerse a la defensiva: \"Si quieres vender tus acciones, te buscar√© comprador. Ya basta\". El entrevistador se lo tom√≥ a risa y Altman continu√≥ en un tono suave, pero claramente sarc√°stico: \"Hay mucha gente que habla con gran preocupaci√≥n sobre nuestros productos y que estar√≠a encantada de comprar acciones\". Pulsa en la imagen para ver la publicaci√≥n en X. Cifras. OpenAI alcanz√≥ hace poco una valoraci√≥n de 500.000 millones de d√≥lares, convirti√©ndose en la empresa privada m√°s valiosa del mundo. No s√≥lo es la m√°s valiosa, ha firmado acuerdos con algunas de las empresas tech m√°s importantes como NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom y ayer mismo con Amazon. No s√≥lo es valiosa, es que la industria tech ha atado su destino al de OpenAI. Si falla, las consecuencias pueden ser catastr√≥ficas. En Xataka Los modelos de IA tienen un problema: se llama 'data poisoning' y los est√° envenenando desde dentro P√©rdidas. Brad Gerstner no va para nada desencaminado cuando le pregunta a Altman por la incoherencia entre el gasto y el beneficio de su empresa. Hace unos d√≠as, Microsoft present√≥ sus resultados y, dado que poseen el 27% de OpenAI, en The Register hicieron el c√°lculo de cu√°nto dinero hab√≠a perdido la empresa de Altman en el √∫ltimo trimestre. La cifra es mareante: 11.500 millones en tan s√≥lo 90 d√≠as. Es como para estar preocupado. Con √°nimo de lucro. Despu√©s de meses de rumores sobre un inminente divorcio, finalmente Microsoft y OpenAI firmaron una especie de separaci√≥n de bienes. En paralelo, OpenAI por fin consigui√≥ su ansiado objetivo: convertirse por fin en una empresa con √°nimo de lucro. Esta medida les de m√°s flexibilidad para colaborar con terceros y hacer nuevas rondas de inversi√≥n. M√°s madera. A pesar de las m√°s que justificadas dudas sobre el astron√≥mico gasto en IA, las grandes tecnol√≥gicas anunciaron hace unos d√≠as que iban a gastar a√∫n m√°s de lo que ten√≠an previsto. Los inversores est√°n preocupados, y si no que se lo digan a Zuckerberg, que a pesar de conseguir ingresos r√©cord, vio como sus acciones ca√≠an un 8%. Cuesti√≥n de fe. Sam Altman comparte el mismo optimismo y, respondiendo a Gerstner, afirma que \"los ingresos est√°n creciendo r√°pidamente (...) estamos haciendo una apuesta abierta a que seguir√°n creciendo\". Curioso que no da ninguna cifra que lo respalde.

Unlike prior studies that primarily rely on simulation-based settings or unsynchronized data, we collected a multimodal dataset comprising synchronized controller area network (CAN)-bus and smartphone-based inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals from drivers on consistent highway sections under both ADAS-enabled and manual modes. Using these data, we developed lightweight classification pipelines based on statistical and deep learning approaches to explore the feasibility of distinguishing ADAS operation. Our analyses revealed systematic behavioral differences between modes, particularly in speed regulation and steering stability, highlighting how ADAS reduces steering variability and stabilizes speed control. Although classification accuracy was moderate, this study provides one of the first data-driven demonstrations of ADAS status detection under naturalistic conditions. Beyond classification, the released dataset enables systematic behavioral analysis and offers a valuable resource for advancing research on driver monitoring, adaptive ADAS algorithms, and accident forensics.", "source": "science_mdpi_sensors", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6139", "published_date": "2025-10-04T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-04T06:36:03.738574", "language": "en", "tags": ["open-access", "sensors", "engineering", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Sensors", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 160, "author": "Jong-Uk Hou", "raw_content_length": 1285, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 0.8, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Multimodal Driving Data", "CAN)-bus", "ADAS"], "persons": ["Vol"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1285, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["ADAS", "Sensors", "Pages", "Multimodal Driving Data", "the activation status", "advanced driver assistance systems", "real-world driving environments", "safety", "responsibility attribution", "accident forensics"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"ADAS": 3.0, "Sensors": 2.0, "Pages": 2.0, "Multimodal Driving Data": 2.0, "the activation status": 1.0, "advanced driver assistance systems": 1.0, "real-world driving environments": 1.0, "safety": 1.0, "responsibility attribution": 1.0, "accident forensics": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 6.675183993055556, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.009499999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.4019, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}}
{"id": "community_social_dev_to_e521089a03e8", "title": "GraphBit vs. LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, and similar tools", "content": "1) Performance & Architecture Rust core with Python bindings (PyO3) Advantage: The workflow engine, agent execution, LLM provider integrations, concurrency manager, and resilience primitives are implemented in Rust. This gives lower runtime overhead, real multi-threaded parallelism, and predictable memory usage versus Python-only orchestration layers constrained by the GIL. Memory: The core selectively uses optimized allocators (e.g., jemalloc on Unix) and pre-allocation patterns, reducing allocation churn. Python-facing APIs expose results without pushing heavy orchestration back into Python. Concurrency: GraphBit implements per-node-type concurrency control in Rust with atomic counters and wait queues, enabling high-throughput scheduling without a single global semaphore bottleneck. Python-only stacks typically rely on asyncio or coarse-grained concurrency constructs that can add overhead under high load. Practical impact: Faster parallel execution of independent workflow nodes Lower latency variance under load Better CPU utilization on multi-core machines Lower memory overhead for long-running flows 2) Workflow Orchestration Graph-based, dependency-aware DAG engine GraphBit executes nodes in batches based on topological order, with clear validation (cycle detection, edge validity, unique constraints) and automatic context propagation. It injects parent outputs into agent prompts in a structured, repeatable way (preamble plus a context JSON block), so downstream agents always have the right data. Competitor patterns Many Python-first frameworks started with sequential ‚Äúchains‚Äù or prompt pipelines, later adding graph-like constructs. Validation depth, dependency caching, and context discipline vary by project and integration. Reliability in execution GraphBit‚Äôs engine couples scheduling with built-in retries, backoff with jitter, circuit breakers, and per-node concurrency. This is part of the core executor rather than left to user code or separate plugins. Practical impact: More reliable parallelism with fewer orchestration bugs Early detection of configuration/graph issues before runtime Fewer ‚Äúlost context‚Äù errors and higher consistency in agent responses 3) Multi-LLM Integration Unified provider abstraction GraphBit normalizes message formats, tool call structures, usage accounting, and finish reasons across providers. Verified providers include OpenAI, Anthropic, and local Ollama; the factory is wired for additional vendors. Vendor flexibility The same workflow and agent code can switch between local and cloud providers, enabling cost/performance optimizations and data locality. The Ollama integration includes model availability checks and auto-pull for smoother local usage. Competitor patterns Competitors support many providers, but abstraction depth and parity (especially around tool calling and usage details) can be uneven across integrations, leading to app-level conditionals. GraphBit aims for stronger normalization inside the core. Practical impact: Easier provider swaps without changing workflow logic Ability to blend local (Ollama) and cloud providers with consistent semantics Less provider-specific branching in application code 4) Production Reliability Built-in resilience primitives Retries with exponential backoff and jitter based on error classification (timeouts, rate limits, auth failures, etc.). Circuit breaker per agent/provider with Closed/Open/Half-Open states and timed recovery to prevent cascading failures. Per-node-type concurrency limits to protect hot spots without globally throttling the entire workflow. Competitor patterns Reliability is often achieved using generic Python libraries (e.g., tenacity) or left to infrastructure (queues, schedulers). Circuit breakers and fine-grained concurrency policies are less commonly integrated into the orchestration core. Practical impact: Fewer cascaded outages when one provider degrades Controlled recovery after faults without manual restarts Higher throughput stability and predictable SLOs 5) Tool Integration Two-phase tool orchestration The agent first signals that tools are required. The Python layer executes registered tools (with declared schemas and names), aggregates results, and only then prompts the LLM for a finalized response. This creates a clean separation of concerns: Rust handles detection and structure, Python executes user tools, and the core composes a final, context-rich prompt. Competitor patterns Many frameworks support tools/function-calling, but the orchestration style varies. Some embed tools deeply in the agent call; others rely on application code to loop and re-prompt. Schema discipline and result injection patterns can be inconsistent. Practical impact: Predictable, auditable tool flows with fewer ‚Äúhallucinated‚Äù arguments Easier to register/manage tools per node with clear schemas Consistent finalization prompts that improve answer quality 6) Developer Experience Python-first API with production utilities Clear classes for Workflow, Node, Executor, LLM config/client, embeddings, document loaders, and text splitters. Utilities for init, configure runtime, get system info, health checks, and graceful shutdown. Automatic context passing into agent prompts removes boilerplate and reduces bugs. RAG-friendly components included Built-in embeddings (OpenAI/HuggingFace), text splitters (character, token, sentence, recursive, etc.), and document loading (common formats) are available in one place. Competitor patterns LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Haystack offer rich ecosystems for RAG and chains/graphs. GraphBit‚Äôs differentiator is the combination of these conveniences with a Rust-powered execution engine and built-in resilience. Practical impact: Faster time-to-production with fewer moving parts Less glue code for health checks, runtime config, and context handling Consistent RAG building blocks without additional libraries 7) Specific Use Case Advantages High-throughput, multi-step pipelines under real load GraphBit‚Äôs Rust core, per-node-type concurrency, and retries/circuit breakers handle parallel branches and provider hiccups more gracefully than Python-only orchestrators. Hybrid local + cloud AI Seamless use of local models (Ollama) with provider parity reduces costs and improves data locality; easy fallback to cloud providers if needed. Tool-heavy agents with strict result integration Two-phase tool orchestration and structured prompt finalization give a cleaner, more reliable tool use story in regulated or quality-sensitive settings. Document-centric and RAG workflows Native document loading, text splitting strategies, and embedding clients simplify building end-to-end content pipelines. Developer teams needing Python ergonomics with systems-level reliability Python API layered over a systems-grade Rust engine combines familiarity with performance and safety. Balanced view: current gaps to consider Some declared node types (Split, Join, HttpRequest, Custom) are not yet implemented in the core executor. If your workflows rely on these, GraphBit will need extensions. Streaming support exists at the interface level but is not consistently implemented per provider. CI workflows and broader automated quality gates are present as disabled configurations; enabling them would strengthen enterprise readiness. While the provider factory is wired for multiple vendors, verified parity is highest today for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama. Bottom line GraphBit differentiates by combining a high-performance Rust engine with a convenient Python API, delivering: Faster, more consistent parallel execution Stronger built-in reliability (retries with jitter, circuit breakers, targeted concurrency) A disciplined tool orchestration flow Clean, normalized multi-LLM integration including local models RAG-friendly utilities bundled into the same stack For teams pushing agentic AI into production‚Äîwith real parallelism, reliability requirements, and a mix of local and cloud models‚ÄîGraphBit provides a more robust foundation than Python-only frameworks, while still offering a developer-friendly Python surface. Note on scope This analysis is grounded in GraphBit‚Äôs actual codebase and documentation observed in this repository. Comparisons to other frameworks are based on widely known characteristics of those ecosystems rather than their source code.

{"id": "arxiv_be0cab164aa4", "title": "SmartSecChain-SDN: A Blockchain-Integrated Intelligent Framework for Secure and Efficient Software", "content": "With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs, and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology, to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus, guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service (QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic, such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection, securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of next-generation programmable networks.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05156v1", "published_date": "2025-11-07T11:22:04", "collected_date": "2025-11-10T06:51:47.418015", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprint", "academic", "cscr", "csai", "cslg", "csni", "c23"], "metadata": {"arxiv_id": "2511.05156v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05156v1.pdf", "authors": ["Azhar Hussain Mozumder", "M.

Unlike existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative essays and the user's understanding of a given text.

Rather than transforming to impact-parameter space, we remain in k and embed a normalized integrand s(x, k; Q) whose auto-convolution produces the observed qT spectra. The extraction proceeds in two steps. Stage I learns the structure kernel S(qT , x1, x2; QM ) by regressing the cross-section with known kinematic prefactors and charge-weighted PDF combinations factored out; experimental and PDF uncertainties are propagated with Monte Carlo replicas. Stage II reconstructs s(x, k; Q) with an end-to-end differentiable k quadrature layer. Applied to Fermilab cross-section data from experiments E288 and E605, the method reproduces the measured qT spectra across Q and yields x and Q dependent TMDs that broaden with Q, with uncertainty bands that consistently propagate experimental, PDF, algorithmic and methodological components. The approach is minimally biased (no factorized Ansatze and no bT transform) and provides a transferable template for polarized TMDs and related QCD inverse problems.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17243v1", "published_date": "2025-10-20T07:31:01", "collected_date": "2025-10-21T12:55:49.671851", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprint", "academic", "hep-ph"], "metadata": {"arxiv_id": "2510.17243v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17243v1.pdf", "authors": ["I.

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_6c16d3047b4f", "title": "Anthropic and Microsoft announce new AI data center projects in Texas, New York, and Georgia", "content": "Artificial intelligence company Anthropic announced a $50 billion investment in computing infrastructure on November 12 that will include new data centers in Texas and New York. The same day, Microsoft announced a new data center under construction in Atlanta, describing it as connected to another in Wisconsin to form a “massive supercomputer” running on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips to power AI technology. The latest deals show that the tech industry is moving forward on huge spending to build energy-hungry AI infrastructure, despite lingering financial concerns about a bubble, environmental considerations, and the political effects of fast-rising electricity bills in the communities where they’re constructed. Anthropic, maker of the chatbot Claude, said it is working with London-based Fluidstack to build the new computing facilities to power its AI systems. It didn’t disclose their exact locations or what source of electricity they will need. Another company, cryptocurrency mining data center developer TeraWulf, previously revealed it was working with Fluidstack on Google-backed data center projects in Texas and in New York, on the shore of Lake Ontario. TeraWulf declined comment Wednesday. A report last month from TD Cowen said that the leading cloud computing providers leased a “staggering” amount of U.S. data center capacity in the third fiscal quarter of this year, amounting to more than 7.4 gigawatts of energy, more than all of last year combined. Oracle was securing the most capacity during that time, much of it supporting AI workloads for Anthropic’s chief rival, OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT. Google was second and Fluidstack came in third, ahead of Meta, Amazon, CoreWeave, and Microsoft. Anthropic said its projects will create about 800 permanent jobs and 2,400 construction jobs. It said in a statement that the “scale of this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for Claude from hundreds of thousands of businesses while keeping our research at the frontier.” Microsoft has branded its Atlanta data center as Fairwater 2, after the original Fairwater complex being built near Milwaukee. The company said it will help power its own technology, along with OpenAI’s and that of other AI developers. Microsoft was, until earlier this year, OpenAI’s exclusive cloud computing provider before the two companies amended their partnership. OpenAI has since announced more than $1 trillion in infrastructure obligations, much of it tied to its Stargate project with partners Oracle and SoftBank. The tech industry’s huge amount of spending on computing infrastructure for AI startups that aren’t yet profitable has fueled concerns about an AI investment bubble. Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI and Anthropic and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power their AI products. Anthropic said it will continue to “prioritize cost-effective, capital-efficient approaches” to scaling up its business. —By Matt O’Brien, AP technology writer", "source":

I've been working on a realtime agent that has access to different tools for my client. Some of those tools might take a few seconds or even sometimes minutes to finish. Because of the sequential behavior of models it just forces me to stop talking or cancels the tool call if I interrupt. Did anyone here have this problem? How did you handle it? I know pipecat has async tool calls done with some orchestration but I've tried this pattern and it's kinda working with gpt-5 but for any other model the replacement of tool result in the past just screws it up and it has no idea what just happened.

This paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering 2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275v1", "published_date":

{"id": "arxiv_43ac0633a4f0", "title": "The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education in Spain: Descriptive Analysis and International Perspectives", "content": "AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS.

Initially prescribed for neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy, stroke prophylaxis) and hypertension, modern research has expanded its therapeutic portfolio to include anti-aging, antitumor, and osteoprotective applications. This systematic review synthesizes 1) traditional ethnopharmacological uses, 2) phytochemical profiling of 100+ identified bioactive metabolites (e.g., gastrodin, parishins), and 3) mechanistic insights into their pharmacokinetic behaviors and pharmacodynamic actions. Notably, botanical drug interactions in TCM formulations enhance gastrodin’s blood-brain barrier penetration, elucidating clinical efficacy. While in vitro/vivo studies validate GE’s antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, translational challenges persist: 1) Limited clinical trials on novel indications (e.g., osteoporosis); 2) Unclear structure-activity relationships of minor metabolites; 3) Standardization needs for industrial applications. This work provides an evidence base to guide future research on GE’s diversified therapeutic development.", "source": "bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "community_social_reddit_artificial_33dc01f4d5a0", "title": "Preference", "content": "I am part of the team behind Arch-Router (https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B), A 1.5B preference-aligned LLM router that guides model selection by matching queries to user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing). Offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences and subjective evaluation criteria in routing decisions. Today we are extending that approach to Claude Code via Arch Gateway[1], bringing multi-LLM access into a single CLI agent with two main benefits: Model Access: Use Claude Code alongside Grok, Mistral, Gemini, DeepSeek, GPT or local models via Ollama. Preference-aligned routing: Assign different models to specific coding tasks, such as – Code generation – Code reviews and comprehension – Architecture and system design – Debugging Sample config file to make it all work. llm_providers: # Ollama Models - model: ollama/gpt-oss:20b default: true base_url: http://host.docker.internal:11434 # OpenAI Models - model: openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07 access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY routing_preferences: - name: code generation description: generating new code snippets, functions, or boilerplate based on user prompts or requirements - model: openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14 access_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY routing_preferences: - name: code understanding description: understand and explain existing code snippets, functions, or libraries Why not route based on public benchmarks? Most routers lean on performance metrics — public benchmarks like MMLU or MT-Bench, or raw latency/cost curves. The problem: they miss domain-specific quality, subjective evaluation criteria, and the nuance of what a “good” response actually means for a particular user. They can be opaque, hard to debug, and disconnected from real developer needs.

However, existing approaches to measuring AI exposure in the workforce predominantly rely on concurrent market conditions, offering limited predictive capacity for anticipating future disruptions. This paper presents a predictive study examining whether online discussions about LLMs can function as early indicators of labor market shifts. We employ four distinct analytical approaches to identify the domains and timeframes in which public discourse serves as a leading signal for employment changes, thereby demonstrating its predictive validity for labor market dynamics. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset that integrates the REALM corpus of LLM discussions, LinkedIn job postings, Indeed employment indices, and over 4 million LinkedIn user profiles, we analyze the relationship between discussion intensity across news media and Reddit forums and subsequent variations in job posting volumes, occupational net change ratios, job tenure patterns, unemployment duration, and transitions to GenAI-related roles across thirteen occupational categories. Our findings reveal that discussion intensity predicts employment changes 1-7 months in advance across multiple indicators, including job postings, net hiring rates, tenure patterns, and unemployment duration. These findings suggest that monitoring online discourse can provide actionable intelligence for workers making reskilling decisions and organizations anticipating skill requirements, offering a real-time complement to traditional labor statistics in navigating technological disruption.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16028v1", "published_date":

{"id": "science_mdpi_electronics_fd28d39d92c7", "title": "Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 3849: A Comparative Study of BERT", "content": "Assessing teaching behavior is essential for improving instructional quality, particularly in Physical Education, where classroom interactions are fast-paced and complex. Traditional evaluation methods such as questionnaires, expert observations, and manual discourse analysis are often limited by subjectivity, high labor costs, and poor scalability. These challenges underscore the need for automated, objective tools to support pedagogical assessment. This study explores and compares the use of Transformer-based language models for the automatic classification of teaching behaviors from real classroom transcriptions. A dataset of over 1300 utterances was compiled and annotated according to the teaching styles proposed in the circumplex approach (Autonomy Support, Structure, Control, and Chaos), along with an additional category for messages in which no style could be identified (Unidentified Style). To address class imbalance and enhance linguistic variability, data augmentation techniques were applied. Eight pretrained BERT-based Transformer architectures were evaluated, including several pretraining strategies and architectural structures. BETO achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.78, a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.72, and a weighted F1-score of 0.77. It showed strength in identifying challenging utterances labeled as Chaos and Autonomy Support. Furthermore, other BERT-based models purely trained with a Spanish text corpus like DistilBERT also present competitive performance, achieving accuracy metrics over 0.73 and and F1-score of 0.68. These results demonstrate the potential of leveraging Transformer-based models for objective and scalable teacher behavior classification. The findings support the feasibility of leveraging pretrained language models to develop scalable, AI-driven systems for classroom behavior classification and pedagogical feedback.", "source": "science_mdpi_electronics", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/19/3849", "published_date": "2025-09-28T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-09-29T01:52:23.043341", "language": "en", "tags": ["engineering", "open-access", "electronics", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Electronics", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 246, "author": "Evelia Franco Franco Álvarez", "raw_content_length": 1903, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.23, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Transformer", "BERT Assessing", "Physical Education"], "persons": ["Autonomy Support", "Vol"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1903, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Electronics", "Pages", "A Comparative Study", "BERT", "behavior", "instructional quality", "Physical Education", "classroom interactions", "Traditional evaluation methods", "questionnaires"], "filter_categories": {"research_academic": ["A Comparative Study"], "ai_ml": ["questionnaires"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Electronics": 2.0, "Pages": 2.0, "A Comparative Study": 2.0, "BERT": 2.0, "behavior": 1.0, "instructional quality": 1.0, "Physical Education": 1.0, "classroom interactions": 1.0, "Traditional evaluation methods": 1.0, "questionnaires": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 26.33201499638889, "is_recent": false, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 6.0115, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.2023, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}}

{"id": "spanish_xataka_7a8341c452ea", "title": "Google AI Plus: qué es esta suscripción, qué incluye y cuánto cuesta en España", "content": "Vamos a decirte cuál es el precio y las características de la suscripción AI Plus de Google. Se trata de una suscripción inferior a la de Google AI Pro, que conserva cosas como el acceso a los modelos más avanzados de Gemini, pero recorta en el uso de otras herramientas adicionales. Este es un movimiento parecido al de ChatGPT Go, con el que Google intenta hacer más accesible la inteligencia artificial de pago. Porque las suscripciones de 20 euros son excesivas para la mayoría de usuarios, por lo que han decidido probar con una bastante inferior. Te diremos las características y la comparativa la otra suscripción. Qué es Google AI Plus Google AI Plus es el nombre de la suscripción más barata para usar Gemini de pago. Gemini es la inteligencia artificial de la empresa, y su versión gratuita está bastante limitada en cuanto al acceso a modelos más avanzados y potentes. La solución si quieres un mayor acceso a la IA más potente de Google es pagar, y esta es una suscripción que busca ser más asequible. Inicialmente Google creó dos suscripciones de pago. Para la gente \"de a pie\" ofrecía la AI Pro con un precio de 22 euros al mes, y para usuarios más avanzados otra de 275 euros al mes. Claramente, incluso la más \"barata\" era excesiva para la mayoría de los usuarios, por lo que decidieron crear un escalón más, una suscripción más económica. Pagando esta suscripción tendrás acceso a Gemini 3 Pro o los nuevos modelos que llegan en el futuro. El acceso no será algo más limitado que el de la suscripción más cara, pero más amplio que en la versión gratuita. También tendrás acceso a interacciones de la IA con Gmail y otros servicios de Google, creación de vídeo y más.

La versión más cara tiene límites de uso más amplios, pero la económica ya es una puerta de acceso interesante, también para crear vídeos a partir de imágenes. Una de las diferencias la vemos en la cantidad de créditos mensuales para Flow y Whisk, que es cinco veces superior en la suscripción más cara. También pasa lo mismo con NotebookLM, que tiene cinco veces más límites en la versión de Pro, pero en la Plus ya tienes acceso. También pasa lo mismo con la posibilidad de usar Gemini en las apps de Google, como Gmail o los documentos, en ambas suscripciones la tienes. La principal diferencia viene con tres herramientas adicionales. La suscripción más económica no incluye las ventajas adicionales al usar Gemini en tu altavoz inteligente, como pueden ser un mayor historial de eventos y funciones. Tampoco tienes acceso a las opciones especiales para crear código o agentes de programación. Para esto tendrás que ir a la suscripción Pro como mínimo. También hay diferencia en el almacenamiento que se le añade a tu cuenta de Google. En la versión Pro siguen siendo 2 TB, pero en la Plus ya tienes 200 GB, que son más que los 15 GB que te da Google gratis. En Xataka Cómo crear presentaciones en Gemini desde un documento usando un solo prompt Precio de Google AI Plus Google AI Plus tiene un precio de 7,99 euros al mes. Puede haber ocasiones en las que haya una promoción temporal, como dos meses a 3,99 euros y luego ya volver a la suscripción normal. Pero el precio completo son los ocho euros al mes.

{"id": "arxiv_f299f282bbc9", "title": "KScaNN: Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on Kunpeng", "content": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a cornerstone algorithm for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and machine learning applications. While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this domain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a critical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port of existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial performance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel ANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN embodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware algorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific optimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques, including a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual calculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an ML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of search parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and 3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for the critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results demonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a new standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based solution. This work provides a definitive blueprint for achieving leadership-class performance for vector search on modern ARM architectures and underscores", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url":

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_c56f029b0398", "title": "LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?", "content": "LightReasoner: How Tiny AI Tutors Boost Big Brain Power Ever wondered if a little helper could make a genius even smarter? Scientists discovered a clever trick: let a small language model point out the exact moments when a larger model gets stuck, then use those clues to sharpen the big model’s thinking. Imagine a junior chef tasting a dish and shouting “add a pinch of salt!” – that tiny tip can transform the whole recipe. In the new LightReasoner method, the “junior” AI watches the “master” solve puzzles, spots the critical steps, and creates bite‑size teaching examples. The master model then rehearses only those key moments, cutting training time by up to 90% and needing far fewer data samples. The result? A boost of up to 28% in math problem accuracy without any human‑written answers. This breakthrough shows that even modest AI can become a powerful coach, making the biggest models smarter and greener. Next time you chat with an AI, remember: behind the scenes, a tiny teacher might be polishing its answers just for you. 🌟 Read article comprehensive review in Paperium.net: LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning? 🤖 This analysis and review was primarily generated and structured by an AI .

At first, AI could only generate text. Then it got search: now it can access real-time information. Then came tools and the ability to write and execute code, which basically unlocked infinite potential. Then RAG arrived: allowing models to tap into custom knowledge bases and context dynamically. When you combine all of this, LLMs aren’t just chatbots anymore. They’re practically digital brains that can interact with the real world. For example, you can now automate your entire house, from waking you up, turning on and off lights dynamically, managing your schedule, and even making you breakfast. All powered by GPT-5 or similar models. Basically Jarvis real life. Yet 90% of people still see AI as “a fancy Siri that talks better.” So I’m curious, what are some of the other hidden or mind-blowing capabilities of modern AI models that most people have no idea about?

{"id": "arxiv_9f10639bcac7", "title": "Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy", "content": "Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \\cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \\JADESeleven, \\JADESzthirteen, \\JADESfz, and \\JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects.

{"id": "arxiv_18a94ec97264", "title": "SmartMLOps Studio: Design of an LLM", "content": "The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) applications has intensified the demand for integrated environments that unify model development, deployment, and monitoring. Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01850v1", "published_date":

{"id": "arxiv_899a61df6aeb", "title": "FAST", "content": "The Surface Brightness Fluctuation method is one of the most reliable and efficient ways of measuring distances to galaxies within 100 Mpc. While recent implementations have increasingly relied on space-based observations, SBF remains effective when applied to ground-based data. In particular, deep, wide-field imaging surveys with sub-arcsecond seeing conditions allows us for accurate SBF measurements across large samples of galaxies. With the upcoming next generation wide-area imaging surveys, the thousands of galaxies suitable for SBF measurements will give us the opportunity to constrain the 3D structure of the local universe. We present FAST-SBF, a new Python-based pipeline for measuring SBF, developed to support the analysis of large datasets from upcoming wide-field imaging surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman. The procedure, still in the testing and development stage, is designed for automation and minimal user intervention, offering a fast and flexible approach to SBF distance estimation. We validate the performance of the procedure on high-quality imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), a precursor to LSST, analyzing a sample of both luminous early-type galaxies and fainter dwarfs. Our measurements are also compared with recent results from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and with the SPoT stellar population synthesis models. The results show excellent agreement with published distances, with the capability of measuring the SBF signal also for faint dwarf galaxies. The pipeline allows the user to completely analyze a galaxy in relatively short time ($\\approx$ minutes) and significantly reduces the need for user intervention. reduces at minimum the user intervention. The FAST-SBF tool is planned for public release to support the community in using SBF as a distance indicator in next-generation surveys.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20373v1", "published_date": "2025-10-23T09:12:42", "collected_date": "2025-10-24T06:58:31.053908", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprint", "academic", "astro-phga", "astro-phim", "engineering", "engineering_systems"], "metadata": {"arxiv_id": "2510.20373v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20373v1.pdf", "authors": ["Gabriele Riccio", "Michele Cantiello", "Rebecca Habas", "Nandini Hazra", "Giuseppe D'Ago", "Gabriella Raimondo", "John P.

{"id": "arxiv_bea00b374fe6", "title": "Verifiable Split Learning via zk", "content": "Split learning is an approach to collaborative learning in which a deep neural network is divided into two parts: client-side and server-side at a cut layer. The client side executes its model using its raw input data and sends the intermediate activation to the server side. This configuration architecture is very useful for enabling collaborative training when data or resources are separated between devices. However, split learning lacks the ability to verify the correctness and honesty of the computations that are performed and exchanged between the parties. To this purpose, this paper proposes a verifiable split learning framework that integrates a zk-SNARK proof to ensure correctness and verifiability. The zk-SNARK proof and verification are generated for both sides in forward propagation and backward propagation on the server side, guaranteeing verifiability on both sides. The verifiable split learning architecture is compared to a blockchain-enabled system for the same deep learning network, one that records updates but without generating the zero-knowledge proof. From the comparison, it can be deduced that applying the zk-SNARK test achieves verifiability and correctness, while blockchains are lightweight but unverifiable.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01356v1", "published_date": "2025-11-03T09:05:07", "collected_date": "2025-11-05T18:45:18.105399", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprint", "academic", "cslg"], "metadata": {"arxiv_id": "2511.01356v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01356v1.pdf", "authors": ["Rana Alaa", "Darío González-Ferreiro", "Carlos Beis-Penedo", "Manuel Fernández-Veiga", "Rebeca P.

{"id": "arxiv_29da9138f646", "title": "Accelerated Prediction of Temperature", "content": "Lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $κ_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $κ_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data obtained from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $κ_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $κ_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $κ_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $κ_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler compounds and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $κ_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $κ_L$ for thermoelectric applications.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13202v2", "published_date": "2025-11-17T10:14:40", "collected_date":

{"id": "arxiv_fe518354e5fa", "title": "SoK: Honeypots & LLMs, More Than the Sum of Their Parts?", "content": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to resolve the long-standing paradox in honeypot design: achieving high-fidelity deception with low operational risk. However, despite a flurry of research since late 2022, progress has been incremental, and the field lacks a cohesive understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper provides the first comprehensive overview of this new domain. We survey and systematize three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on LLM-honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends; and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple data reduction to automated intelligence generation. We synthesize these findings into a forward-looking research roadmap, arguing that the true potential of this technology lies in creating autonomous, self-improving deception systems to counter the emerging threat of intelligent, automated attackers.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25939v1", "published_date": "2025-10-29T20:20:51", "collected_date": "2025-10-31T03:02:20.705319", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprint", "academic", "cscr", "engineering", "engineering_systems"], "metadata": {"arxiv_id": "2510.25939v1", "pdf_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25939v1.pdf", "authors": ["Robert A.
