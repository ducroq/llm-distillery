{"id":"community_social_dev_to_e521089a03e8","title":"GraphBit vs. LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, and similar tools","content":"1) Performance & Architecture Rust core with Python bindings (PyO3) Advantage: The workflow engine, agent execution, LLM provider integrations, concurrency manager, and resilience primitives are implemented in Rust. This gives lower runtime overhead, real multi-threaded parallelism, and predictable memory usage versus Python-only orchestration layers constrained by the GIL. Memory: The core selectively uses optimized allocators (e.g., jemalloc on Unix) and pre-allocation patterns, reducing allocation churn. Python-facing APIs expose results without pushing heavy orchestration back into Python. Concurrency: GraphBit implements per-node-type concurrency control in Rust with atomic counters and wait queues, enabling high-throughput scheduling without a single global semaphore bottleneck. Python-only stacks typically rely on asyncio or coarse-grained concurrency constructs that can add overhead under high load. Practical impact: Faster parallel execution of independent workflow nodes Lower latency variance under load Better CPU utilization on multi-core machines Lower memory overhead for long-running flows 2) Workflow Orchestration Graph-based, dependency-aware DAG engine GraphBit executes nodes in batches based on topological order, with clear validation (cycle detection, edge validity, unique constraints) and automatic context propagation. It injects parent outputs into agent prompts in a structured, repeatable way (preamble plus a context JSON block), so downstream agents always have the right data. Competitor patterns Many Python-first frameworks started with sequential ‚Äúchains‚Äù or prompt pipelines, later adding graph-like constructs. Validation depth, dependency caching, and context discipline vary by project and integration. Reliability in execution GraphBit‚Äôs engine couples scheduling with built-in retries, backoff with jitter, circuit breakers, and per-node concurrency. This is part of the core executor rather than left to user code or separate plugins. Practical impact: More reliable parallelism with fewer orchestration bugs Early detection of configuration/graph issues before runtime Fewer ‚Äúlost context‚Äù errors and higher consistency in agent responses 3) Multi-LLM Integration Unified provider abstraction GraphBit normalizes message formats, tool call structures, usage accounting, and finish reasons across providers. Verified providers include OpenAI, Anthropic, and local Ollama; the factory is wired for additional vendors. Vendor flexibility The same workflow and agent code can switch between local and cloud providers, enabling cost/performance optimizations and data locality. The Ollama integration includes model availability checks and auto-pull for smoother local usage. Competitor patterns Competitors support many providers, but abstraction depth and parity (especially around tool calling and usage details) can be uneven across integrations, leading to app-level conditionals. GraphBit aims for stronger normalization inside the core. Practical impact: Easier provider swaps without changing workflow logic Ability to blend local (Ollama) and cloud providers with consistent semantics Less provider-specific branching in application code 4) Production Reliability Built-in resilience primitives Retries with exponential backoff and jitter based on error classification (timeouts, rate limits, auth failures, etc.). Circuit breaker per agent/provider with Closed/Open/Half-Open states and timed recovery to prevent cascading failures. Per-node-type concurrency limits to protect hot spots without globally throttling the entire workflow. Competitor patterns Reliability is often achieved using generic Python libraries (e.g., tenacity) or left to infrastructure (queues, schedulers). Circuit breakers and fine-grained concurrency policies are less commonly integrated into the orchestration core. Practical impact: Fewer cascaded outages when one provider degrades Controlled recovery after faults without manual restarts Higher throughput stability and predictable SLOs 5) Tool Integration Two-phase tool orchestration The agent first signals that tools are required. The Python layer executes registered tools (with declared schemas and names), aggregates results, and only then prompts the LLM for a finalized response. This creates a clean separation of concerns: Rust handles detection and structure, Python executes user tools, and the core composes a final, context-rich prompt. Competitor patterns Many frameworks support tools/function-calling, but the orchestration style varies. Some embed tools deeply in the agent call; others rely on application code to loop and re-prompt. Schema discipline and result injection patterns can be inconsistent. Practical impact: Predictable, auditable tool flows with fewer ‚Äúhallucinated‚Äù arguments Easier to register/manage tools per node with clear schemas Consistent finalization prompts that improve answer quality 6) Developer Experience Python-first API with production utilities Clear classes for Workflow, Node, Executor, LLM config/client, embeddings, document loaders, and text splitters. Utilities for init, configure runtime, get system info, health checks, and graceful shutdown. Automatic context passing into agent prompts removes boilerplate and reduces bugs. RAG-friendly components included Built-in embeddings (OpenAI/HuggingFace), text splitters (character, token, sentence, recursive, etc.), and document loading (common formats) are available in one place. Competitor patterns LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Haystack offer rich ecosystems for RAG and chains/graphs. GraphBit‚Äôs differentiator is the combination of these conveniences with a Rust-powered execution engine and built-in resilience. Practical impact: Faster time-to-production with fewer moving parts Less glue code for health checks, runtime config, and context handling Consistent RAG building blocks without additional libraries 7) Specific Use Case Advantages High-throughput, multi-step pipelines under real load GraphBit‚Äôs Rust core, per-node-type concurrency, and retries/circuit breakers handle parallel branches and provider hiccups more gracefully than Python-only orchestrators. Hybrid local + cloud AI Seamless use of local models (Ollama) with provider parity reduces costs and improves data locality; easy fallback to cloud providers if needed. Tool-heavy agents with strict result integration Two-phase tool orchestration and structured prompt finalization give a cleaner, more reliable tool use story in regulated or quality-sensitive settings. Document-centric and RAG workflows Native document loading, text splitting strategies, and embedding clients simplify building end-to-end content pipelines. Developer teams needing Python ergonomics with systems-level reliability Python API layered over a systems-grade Rust engine combines familiarity with performance and safety. Balanced view: current gaps to consider Some declared node types (Split, Join, HttpRequest, Custom) are not yet implemented in the core executor. If your workflows rely on these, GraphBit will need extensions. Streaming support exists at the interface level but is not consistently implemented per provider. CI workflows and broader automated quality gates are present as disabled configurations; enabling them would strengthen enterprise readiness. While the provider factory is wired for multiple vendors, verified parity is highest today for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama. Bottom line GraphBit differentiates by combining a high-performance Rust engine with a convenient Python API, delivering: Faster, more consistent parallel execution Stronger built-in reliability (retries with jitter, circuit breakers, targeted concurrency) A disciplined tool orchestration flow Clean, normalized multi-LLM integration including local models RAG-friendly utilities bundled into the same stack For teams pushing agentic AI into production‚Äîwith real parallelism, reliability requirements, and a mix of local and cloud models‚ÄîGraphBit provides a more robust foundation than Python-only frameworks, while still offering a developer-friendly Python surface. Note on scope This analysis is grounded in GraphBit‚Äôs actual codebase and documentation observed in this repository. Comparisons to other frameworks are based on widely known characteristics of those ecosystems rather than their source code.

{"id":"arxiv_be0cab164aa4","title":"SmartSecChain-SDN: A Blockchain-Integrated Intelligent Framework for Secure and Efficient Software","content":"With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs, and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology, to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus, guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service (QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic, such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection, securing and enhancing.

{"id":"arxiv_bc16ba80891b","title":"IntelliProof: An Argumentation Network","content":"We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative essays and the user's understanding of a given text.

{"id":"arxiv_baaa83d98506","title":"Deep Neural Network extraction of Unpolarized Transverse Momentum Distributions","content":"Building on the first-ever application of neural networks in TMD phenomenology: \"Extraction of the Sivers function with deep neural networks\", we now present a momentum space, physics-informed deep learning framework for the direct extraction of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) from fixed target Drell-Yan data (E288, E605). Rather than transforming to impact-parameter space, we remain in k and embed a normalized integrand s(x, k; Q) whose auto-convolution produces the observed qT spectra. The extraction proceeds in two steps. Stage I learns the structure kernel S(qT , x1, x2; QM ) by regressing the cross-section with known kinematic prefactors and charge-weighted PDF combinations factored out; experimental and PDF uncertainties are propagated with Monte Carlo replicas. Stage II reconstructs s(x, k; Q) with an end-to-end differentiable k quadrature layer. Applied to Fermilab cross-section data from experiments E288 and E605, the method reproduces the measured qT spectra across Q and yields x and Q dependent TMDs that broaden with Q, with uncertainty bands that consistently propagate experimental, PDF, algorithmic and methodological components. The approach is minimally biased (no factorized Ansatze and no bT transform) and provides a transferable template for polarized TMDs and related QCD inverse problems.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17243v1","published_date":"2025-10-20T07:31:01","collected_date":"2025-10-21T12:55:49.671851","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","hep-ph"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.17243v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17243v1.pdf","authors":["I.

{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_6c16d3047b4f","title":"Anthropic and Microsoft announce new AI data center projects in Texas, New York, and Georgia","content":"Artificial intelligence company Anthropic announced a $50 billion investment in computing infrastructure on November 12 that will include new data centers in Texas and New York. The same day, Microsoft announced a new data center under construction in Atlanta, describing it as connected to another in Wisconsin to form a “massive supercomputer” running on hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips to power AI technology. The latest deals show that the tech industry is moving forward on huge spending to build energy-hungry AI infrastructure, despite lingering financial concerns about a bubble, environmental considerations, and the political effects of fast-rising electricity bills in the communities where they’re constructed. Anthropic, maker of the chatbot Claude, said it is working with London-based Fluidstack to build the new computing facilities to power its AI systems. It didn’t disclose their exact locations or what source of electricity they will need. Another company, cryptocurrency mining data center developer TeraWulf, previously revealed it was working with Fluidstack on Google-backed data center projects in Texas and in New York, on the shore of Lake Ontario. TeraWulf declined comment Wednesday. A report last month from TD Cowen said that the leading cloud computing providers leased a “staggering” amount of U.S. data center capacity in the third fiscal quarter of this year, amounting to more than 7.4 gigawatts of energy, more than all of last year combined. Oracle was securing the most capacity during that time, much of it supporting AI workloads for Anthropic’s chief rival, OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT. Google was second and Fluidstack came in third, ahead of Meta, Amazon, CoreWeave, and Microsoft. Anthropic said its projects will create about 800 permanent jobs and 2,400 construction jobs. It said in a statement that the “scale of this investment is necessary to meet the growing demand for Claude from hundreds of thousands of businesses while keeping our research at the frontier.” Microsoft has branded its Atlanta data center as Fairwater 2, after the original Fairwater complex being built near Milwaukee. The company said it will help power its own technology, along with OpenAI’s and that of other AI developers. Microsoft was, until earlier this year, OpenAI’s exclusive cloud computing provider before the two companies amended their partnership. OpenAI has since announced more than $1 trillion in infrastructure obligations, much of it tied to its Stargate project with partners Oracle and SoftBank. The tech industry’s huge amount of spending on computing infrastructure for AI startups that aren’t yet profitable has fueled concerns about an AI investment bubble. Investors have closely watched a series of intertwined deals over recent months between top AI developers such as OpenAI and Anthropic and the companies building the costly computer chips and data centers needed to power their AI products. Anthropic said it will continue to “prioritize cost-effective, capital-efficient approaches” to scaling up its business. —By Matt O’Brien, AP technology

{"id":"community_social_reddit_local_llama_8a4f68226e56","title":"How to handle long running tools in realtime conversations.","content":"Hi everyone. I've been working on a realtime agent that has access to different tools for my client. Some of those tools might take a few seconds or even sometimes minutes to finish. Because of the sequential behavior of models it just forces me to stop talking or cancels the tool call if I interrupt. Did anyone here have this problem? How did you handle it? I know pipecat has async tool calls done with some orchestration but I've tried this pattern and it's kinda working with gpt-5 but for any other model the replacement of tool result in the past just screws it up and it has no idea what just happened. Similarly with Claude. Gemini is the worst of them all.

{"id":"arxiv_d6bd6de9811a","title":"A Research Roadmap for Augmenting Software Engineering Processes and Software Products with Generative AI","content":"Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE) practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering 2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275v1","published_date":"2025-10-30T08:59:01","collected_date":"2025-10-31T02:58:12.723563","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","csse","csai","cset","cslg","csma"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.26275v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26275v1.pdf","authors":["Domenico
