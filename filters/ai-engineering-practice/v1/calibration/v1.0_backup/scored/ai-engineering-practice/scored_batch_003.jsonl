Experiments are conducted using aluminum alloy specimens coated with ML film sensor on their surfaces. During the tensile process, ML images of the films and speckle images of the specimen backsides are simultaneously acquired. Combined with DIC technology, high-precision full-field strain distributions are obtained. Through spatial registration and region matching algorithms, a quantitative calibration model between ML intensity and DIC strain is established. The research results indicate that the ML intensity and DIC strain exhibit a significant linear correlation (R2 = 0.92). To verify the universality of the model, aluminum alloy notched specimen tests show that the reconstructed strain field is in good agreement with the DIC and finite element analysis results, with an average relative error of 0.23%. This method enables full-field, non-contact conversion of ML signals into strain distributions with high spatial resolution, providing a quantitative basis for studying ML response mechanisms under complex loading.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6018","published_date":"2025-10-01T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-01T06:40:00.238897","language":"en","tags":["sensors","open-access","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":195,"author":"Liyun Chen","raw_content_length":1366,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.975,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["DIC"],"persons":["alumi","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1366,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["DIC","Sensors","Pages","the strain field","the bottleneck","the mapping","the mechanoluminescent","ML intensity field","a quantification method","full-field strain measurement"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["DIC"],"ai_ml":["the strain field"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"DIC":3.0,"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"the strain field":2.0,"the bottleneck":1.0,"the mapping":1.0,"the mechanoluminescent":1.0,"ML intensity field":1.0,"a quantification method":1.0,"full-field strain measurement":1.0}},"age_hours":6.7634511872222225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":4.2345,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.1531,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"heartwarming_score":0,"uplifting_score":0,"inspiring_score":0,"is_heartwarming":false,"is_uplifting":false,"is_inspiring":false,"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":6.0,"evidence":"The paper describes a general workflow for using LLMs in software development, including steps like prompt engineering, code generation, and testing.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_d072ebaf270d","title":"How Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter Elevates Storytelling","content":"Mastering the Narrative: How Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter Elevates Storytelling The adage \"Show, don't tell\" is a cornerstone of effective writing, guiding authors to immerse readers in a story through vivid descriptions, actions, and dialogue rather than simply stating facts or emotions. While universally acknowledged as crucial, mastering this technique can be challenging, often requiring extensive revision and a keen eye for detail. Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter emerges as a powerful digital assistant, designed to transform flat narration into rich, sensory-driven prose, thereby empowering authors to craft more engaging and impactful stories. How the 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter Works At its core, the Midgen AI 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter functions as an intelligent rewriting engine. Authors interact with the tool by providing specific inputs that guide the AI's transformation process: Inputting Flat Narration: The primary step involves the author pasting or typing their existing text‚Äîsentences or paragraphs that might be 'telling' rather than 'showing'‚Äîinto a designated input field. This could be a description of a character's emotion, a setting, or an event. Contextual Parameters: To ensure the rewritten text aligns with the author's vision and the story's nuances, the tool allows for additional contextual information: Setting: Authors can describe the environment where the scene takes place (e.g., \"a bustling marketplace\"). This helps the AI infuse sensory details relevant to the location. Characters: Providing details about the characters involved (e.g., \"a young thief, a wise merchant\") enables the AI to tailor actions and reactions to their personalities and roles. Main Conflict: Specifying the central conflict of the scene or story (e.g., \"the thief stealing from the merchant\") ensures the rewritten text enhances the underlying tension and stakes. Refinement Options: The tool often includes toggles or options for further control, such as whether the rewritten text should maintain the original length as much as possible, or if the content contains adult themes, allowing the AI to adjust its tone and vocabulary accordingly. Upon receiving these inputs, the AI leverages advanced natural language processing and generation techniques to analyze the 'telling' phrases and reconstruct them into 'showing' prose. It identifies abstract statements and replaces them with concrete actions, sensory details, and evocative imagery, effectively painting a picture for the reader rather than merely describing it. How It Helps Authors The 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter offers a multitude of benefits for authors, from novice writers seeking to improve their craft to seasoned professionals looking for an efficient editing aid: Elevating Prose Quality: The most direct benefit is the immediate improvement in writing quality. By converting abstract statements into vivid descriptions, the tool helps authors create more immersive and engaging narratives. Overcoming Descriptive Writer's Block: Authors often struggle to find fresh ways to describe emotions, settings, or character traits. The converter provides creative alternatives, offering new perspectives and breaking through creative impasses. Learning and Internalizing the Technique: Beyond simply rewriting text, the tool serves as an educational aid. By observing how the AI transforms 'telling' into 'showing,' authors can gradually internalize the principles, improving their own writing instincts over time. Ensuring Consistency: For longer works, maintaining a consistent level of descriptive richness can be challenging. The tool helps ensure that even mundane descriptions are elevated, contributing to a cohesive and high-quality narrative throughout. Speeding Up the Writing Process Writing, especially the revision phase, can be time-consuming. The 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter significantly accelerates several aspects of the writing workflow: Efficient Self-Editing: Instead of manually scrutinizing every sentence for 'telling' phrases, authors can quickly process sections of their manuscript through the tool, identifying and rectifying areas that need more 'showing.' This drastically reduces the time spent on a critical aspect of editing. Rapid Draft Improvement: Early drafts often contain a higher proportion of 'telling' as authors focus on getting the story down. The converter allows for quick enhancement of these drafts, making them more readable and engaging much earlier in the process. Reduced Cognitive Load: By offloading the task of rephrasing to the AI, authors can conserve their mental energy for higher-level creative decisions, such as plot development, character arcs, and thematic exploration. Streamlined Feedback Integration: When receiving feedback to 'show more,' authors can use the tool to implement these suggestions rapidly, rather than spending hours brainstorming new descriptive language. Making Suspense More Effective on Readers Suspense thrives on anticipation, atmosphere, and the subtle unfolding of events. The 'Show, Don't Tell' technique is paramount in building effective suspense, and the AI converter enhances this in several ways: Building Atmosphere: Instead of stating that a place is eerie, the tool can help describe the creaking floorboards, the shadows dancing in the corners, or the sudden drop in temperature, allowing readers to feel the eeriness. This sensory immersion heightens tension and makes the suspense more palpable. Gradual Revelation: Suspense often relies on revealing information slowly and indirectly. The converter can help rephrase direct statements about threats or dangers into suggestive details, leaving readers to piece together the implications and increasing their engagement and anxiety. Character Reactions: By showing a character's physical manifestations of fear‚Äîa trembling hand, a quickened breath, darting eyes‚Äîrather than simply stating they are scared, the AI helps convey the emotional stakes more powerfully. This allows readers to empathize more deeply and experience the suspense alongside the character. Pacing and Rhythm: The detailed, sensory language generated by the tool can naturally slow down the narrative in crucial moments, drawing out tension and building anticipation before a reveal or a sudden event, which is vital for effective suspense. Finding the Way Out at the Edge of the Story and Creating More Authors often face moments in their writing where they feel stuck, particularly when a scene or character interaction feels flat, or they struggle to transition between plot points. The 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter can be a valuable asset in these situations: Unlocking New Descriptive Avenues: When a scene feels stagnant, running a 'telling' passage through the converter can reveal new descriptive possibilities. The AI might suggest an action, a piece of dialogue, or a sensory detail that not only improves the immediate text but also sparks ideas for subsequent scenes or character development. Revealing Subtext and Nuance: By forcing a shift from explicit statements to implicit demonstrations, the tool can help authors uncover deeper layers of meaning, subtext, and nuance in their characters' motivations and relationships. This can lead to more complex and compelling narrative arcs. Inspiring Plot Progression: Sometimes, a lack of vivid detail can obscure potential plot developments. When the AI transforms a bland description into an active, sensory experience, it can highlight overlooked connections or introduce new elements that propel the story forward. Enhancing World-Building: For fantasy or sci-fi authors, 'showing' the world rather than 'telling' about it is crucial. The converter can help authors articulate the unique sights, sounds, and feelings of their fictional worlds, making them more real and immersive for readers, and potentially inspiring further world-building details. In conclusion, Midgen AI's 'Show, Don't Tell' Converter is more than just a stylistic editor; it's a creative partner that helps authors embody one of writing's most fundamental principles. By facilitating the transformation of abstract ideas into concrete, sensory experiences, it not only refines prose but also deepens reader engagement, sharpens suspense, and provides a fertile ground for overcoming creative blocks and expanding narrative possibilities. It empowers authors to write with greater impact, ensuring their stories don't just tell, but truly show.","source":"community_social_dev_to","source_type":"rss","url":"https://dev.to/mdsiaofficial/how-midgen-ais-show-dont-tell-converter-elevates-storytelling-49m4","published_date":"2025-10-13T06:14:11","collected_date":"2025-10-13T06:44:17.629398","language":"en","tags":["trends","developer","writing","books","tutorials","community","pubsub","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"DEV Community","source_category":"community_social","word_count":1233,"author":"Md Shoriful Islam Ashiq","raw_content_length":9265,"priority":7,"update_frequency":12,"reading_time_minutes":6.165,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Inputti","Midgen AI's 'Show"],"persons":["Midgen AI's 'Show"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":8528,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Midgen AIs Show","the Narrative","How Midgen AIs Show","Converter Elevates","The adage","Show","a cornerstone","effective writing","guiding authors","readers"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Midgen AIs Show"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Midgen AIs Show":3.0,"the Narrative":1.0,"How Midgen AIs Show":1.0,"Converter Elevates":1.0,"The adage":1.0,"Show":1.0,"a cornerstone":1.0,"effective writing":1.0,"guiding authors":1.0,"readers":1.0}},"age_hours":0.5546129158333333,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.6755,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7351,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8059,"joy":0.0081,"surprise":0.0067,"sadness":0.0056,"fear":0.1049,"anger":0.0246,"disgust":0.0443},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The abstract mentions using machine learning to predict the performance of a new method for solving a specific engineering problem.

{"id":"arxiv_968e9a1f36ec","title":"Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response","content":"This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes. This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML research and user communities.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132v1","published_date":"2025-11-05T02:49:15","collected_date":"2025-11-07T07:00:54.813243","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cscv","csai","cscy"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.03132v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03132v1.pdf","authors":["Thomas Manzini","Priyankari Perali","Robin R.

Each iteration introduces small deviations from best practices. The AI optimizes for immediate problem-solving rather than long-term maintainability. Variable names become generic. You use comments as an excuse to replace clear code. Functions grow longer. Domain concepts blur into technical implementations. The codebase transforms into AI slop: technically functional but semantically hollow code. You request simple changes: rename something, extract something, improve clarity. Each iteration shifts names, removes nuance, and replaces domain words with generic ones. Your code no longer accurately reflects the real-world domain. You lose the shape of the system. This is slow erosion. Sample Code üìñ Wrong ‚ùå def process_data(d, t='standard'): \"\"\"Process customer data\"\"\" if t == 'standard': result = [] for item in d: if item.get('status') == 'active': temp = item.copy() temp['processed'] = True total = 0 for x in temp.get('items', []): total += x.get('price', 0) temp['total'] = total result.append(temp) return result elif t == 'premium': result = [] for item in d: if item.get('status') == 'active' and \\ item.get('tier') == 'premium': temp = item.copy() temp['processed'] = True total = 0 for x in temp.get('items', []): total += x.get('price', 0) * 0.9 temp['total'] = total result.append(temp) return result return [] Right üëâ class CustomerOrder: def __init__(self, customer, items, status): self._customer = customer self._items = items self._status = status def is_active(self): return self._status.is_active() def calculate_total(self): return self._customer.apply_pricing_tier( sum(item.price() for item in self._items) ) def mark_as_processed(self): return ProcessedOrder(self, self.calculate_total()) class OrderProcessor: def process_active_orders(self, orders): return [ order.mark_as_processed() for order in orders if order.is_active() ] Detection üîç [X] Manual You can detect AI-degraded code by reviewing commit history for patterns: consecutive AI-assisted commits without human refactoring, increasing function length over time, proliferation of generic variable names (data, temp, result, item), growing comment-to-code ratio, and duplicated logic with minor variations. Code review tools can track these metrics and flag potential degradation. Exceptions üõë AI assistance remains valuable for boilerplate generation, test case creation, and initial prototyping when you immediately review and refactor the output. The smell appears when you chain multiple AI modifications without human intervention or when you accept AI suggestions without understanding their implications. Tags üè∑Ô∏è Technical Debt Level üîã [x] Intermediate Why the Bijection Is Important üó∫Ô∏è Your code should maintain a clear Bijection between domain concepts in the MAPPERand your implementation. When AI assistants modify code without understanding your domain, they break this mapping. A \"Customer\" becomes \"data\", an \"Order\" becomes \"item\", and \"apply pricing tier\" becomes \"calculate total with discount\". You lose the vocabulary that connects your code to business reality. Each AI iteration moves further from domain language toward generic programming constructs, making the code harder to understand and maintain. AI Generation ü§ñ AI generators frequently create this smell when you prompt them to modify existing code multiple times. Each interaction optimizes for the immediate request without considering the cumulative architectural impact. The AI suggests quick fixes that work but don't align with your codebase's design patterns or domain model. AI assistants tend to replace domain language with generic language. They optimize for pattern consistency instead of meaning. They smooth away intent. AI Detection üß≤ AI can address this issue if you instruct it to restore domain terms and request that it explain its naming choices. You are accountable for the work you delegate to the AI, and you must approve every change. Try Them! üõ† Remember: AI Assistants make lots of mistakes Suggested Prompt: \"Review this code for domain clarity. Replace generic names with domain concepts. Extract duplicated logic into cohesive objects. Ensure each class and method represents a clear business concept. Show me the domain model this code implements.\" Without Proper Instructions With Specific Instructions ChatGPT ChatGPT Claude Claude Perplexity Perplexity Copilot Copilot You You Gemini Gemini DeepSeek DeepSeek Meta AI Meta AI Grok Grok Qwen Qwen Conclusion üèÅ The \"Habsburg problem\" analogy in AI, also called \"Habsburg AI,\" refers to how AI models can degrade when repeatedly trained on content generated primarily by other AI models, like the inbreeding issues suffered by the Habsburg royal family. This causes a loss of diversity and robustness in the AI's outputs, eventually leading AI's responses to become progressively worse or semantically hollow. You must actively review and refactor AI-generated code to maintain quality. Treat AI assistants as junior developers whose work requires supervision. Each AI suggestion should strengthen your domain model, not weaken it. When you notice generic patterns replacing domain language, stop and refactor. Your code's long-term maintainability depends on preserving the connection between business concepts and implementation.

{"id":"arxiv_ec44906bcae4","title":"A Single Set of Adversarial Clothes Breaks Multiple Defense Methods in the Physical World","content":"In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack. However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over 64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against adversarial clothes.

{"id":"community_social_reddit_local_llama_59ba06577728","title":"Anyone else running their whole AI stack as Proxmox LXC containers? Im currently using Open WebUI as front","content":"I have not implemented it yet, but I believe it should be possible for LiteLLM to interface with the Proxmox API and dynamically turn on and off vLLM containers depening on what model users select (in Open WebUI). Does anyone have any experience with this? I want to add a container for n8n for automation workflows (connected to LiteLLM for AI models), a websearch MCP container running something like Searxng (because I find the web search implementation in Open WebUI to be extremely limited) and an (agentic) RAG service. I need robust retrieval over professional/Dutch GAAP/IFRS accounting materials, internal company docs, client data, and relevant laws/regulations. There seem to be a million ways to do RAG; this will be the cornerstone of the system. I built this AI server/Workstation for the Dutch accounting firm I work at (I have no IT background myself so its been quite the learning proces). Managment wanted everything local and I jumped on the oppertunity to learn something new. My specs: CPU - AMD EPYC 9575F Dual GMI links allowing it to use almost all of the theoretical system memory bandwidth, 5Ghz Boost clock, 64 core, 128 thread beast of a CPU, seems to me like the best choice for an AI exterimentation server. Great as a host for GPU inference, Hybrid Inference (GPU + System memory spillover) and CPU only inference. RAM - 1.152tb (12x96gb RDIMMs ) ECC DDR5 6.400MT/s RAM (~614gb/s theoretical max bandwidth). Will allow me to run massive MOE models on the CPU, albeit slowly. Also plenty or ram for any other service I want to run. MOBO - Supermicro H13SSL-N (Rev. 2.01). I have a Supermicro H14SSL-NT on backorder but it could be a couple of weeks before I get that one. GPU's - 3x Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Max-Q. I was planning on getting 2 Workstation editions but the supplier kept fucking up my order and sending me the Max Q's. Eventually caved and got a third Max-Q because I had plenty of cooling and power capacity. 3 gpu's is not ideal for tensor parallelism but pipleline- and expert parallelism are decent alternatives when 2x96 gb is not enough. Maybe I'll get a 4th one eventually. Storage - A bunch of Kioxia CM7 R's. Gpt-oss 120b is the main 'workhorse' model. It comfortably fits in a single GPU so I can use the other GPU's to run auxiliary models that can assist gpt-oss 120b. Maybe a couple of gpt-oss 20b models in a websearch mcp server, a vision language model like Qwen 3 VL, Deepseek-OCR or Gemma 3 for pictures/files. As mentioned, I don‚Äôt come from an IT background, so I‚Äôm looking for practical advice and sanity checks. How does this setup look? Is there anything you‚Äôd fundamentally do differently? I followed a bunch of guides (mostly the excellent ones from DigitalSpaceport), got about 90% of the way with ChatGPT 5 Thinking, and figured out the last 10% through trial and error (Proxmox

{"id":"arxiv_a83dc2d8e32a","title":"Difficulty","content":"Despite its potential, AI advances in music education are hindered by proprietary systems that limit the democratization of technology in this domain. In particular, AI-driven music difficulty adjustment is especially promising, as simplifying complex pieces can make music education more inclusive and accessible to learners of all ages and contexts. Nevertheless, recent efforts have relied on proprietary datasets, which prevents the research community from reproducing, comparing, or extending the current state of the art. In addition, while these generative methods offer great potential, most of them use the MIDI format, which, unlike others, such as MusicXML, lacks readability and layout information, thereby limiting their practical use for human performers. This work introduces a transformer-based method for adjusting the difficulty of MusicXML piano scores. Unlike previous methods, which rely on annotated datasets, we propose a synthetic dataset composed of pairs of piano scores ordered by estimated difficulty, with each pair comprising a more challenging and easier arrangement of the same piece. We generate these pairs by creating variations conditioned on the same melody and harmony and leverage pretrained models to assess difficulty and style, ensuring appropriate pairing. The experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed approach, showing accurate control of playability and target difficulty, as highlighted through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In contrast to previous work, we openly release all resources (code, dataset, and models), ensuring reproducibility while fostering open-source innovation to help bridge the digital divide.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16228v1","published_date":"2025-11-20T10:54:43","collected_date":"2025-11-21T02:08:41.877580","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cssd","research_academic","research_academia"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.16228v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16228v1.pdf","authors":["Pedro
