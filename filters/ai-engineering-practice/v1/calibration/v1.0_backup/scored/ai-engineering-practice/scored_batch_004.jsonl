{"id":"arxiv_6a8be1963216","title":"Classification of worldwide news articles by perceived quality, 2018","content":"This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16416v1","published_date":"2025-11-20T14:41:41","collected_date":"2025-11-22T06:40:57.211635","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cscl","cslg"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.16416v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16416v1.pdf","authors":["Connor McElroy","Thiago E.

{"id":"positive_news_frontiers_sustainable_cities_d2b0edc47e0d","title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of the city master plan in regulating future urban spatial growth of Varanasi city, India","content":"This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the Varanasi City Master Plan 2031 in regulating urban growth by analyzing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes. By comparing the model's predictions for 2031 with the Varanasi Development Authority's Master Plan, the study identifies discrepancies in the direction and extent of urban expansion. Rapid urbanization, driven by industrialization, migration, and infrastructural development, has dramatically reshaped Varanasi's spatial patterns. Utilizing remote sensing data from Landsat images (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2021) and integrating machine learning techniques, including the Multi-layer Perceptron and Markov Chain Analysis (MLP-MCA), this study simulates and predicts future urban expansion. The model's predictions, with an accuracy above 80%, offer critical insights for policymakers to revisit urban planning strategies. The built-up area has grown from 45.10 km2 in 1990 to a projected 262.05 km2 by 2031, representing a 480.95% increase over four decades. Simultaneously, agricultural acreage has declined from 908.23 km2 to 656 km2, a reduction of 252.23 km2, or 27.77%, highlighting the shift from rural to urban land use. Notably, in the southwest, the Masterplan consistently exceeds predicted built-up areas across most zones, except in Zone 4 (9–12 km), with over-allocations around the Mughalsarai area. Furthermore, Sectors A, B, C, and D anticipate higher built-up areas, particularly in zones 6–9 km and 9–12 km. This study underscores the need for sustainable development planning to mitigate the negative impacts of rapid urbanization, such as loss of green spaces, environmental degradation, and urban heat island effects. The combined approach of remote sensing and machine learning provides a robust and replicable methodology for other rapidly urbanizing cities, ensuring future expansion aligns with sustainable development goals.","source":"positive_news_frontiers_sustainable_cities","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsc.2025.1649418","published_date":"2025-11-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-11T18:38:07.051432","language":"en","tags":["open-access","original_research","urban-planning","innovation","collective-benefit","sustainable-cities","positive_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers

{"id":"community_social_github_trending_af69ecc25504","title":"microsoft/BitNet","content":"Official inference framework for 1-bit LLMsbitnet.cpp Try it out via this demo, or build and run it on your own CPU or GPU. bitnet.cpp is the official inference framework for 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). It offers a suite of optimized kernels, that support fast and lossless inference of 1.58-bit models on CPU and GPU (NPU support will coming next). The first release of bitnet.cpp is to support inference on CPUs. bitnet.cpp achieves speedups of 1.37x to 5.07x on ARM CPUs, with larger models experiencing greater performance gains. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption by 55.4% to 70.0%, further boosting overall efficiency. On x86 CPUs, speedups range from 2.37x to 6.17x with energy reductions between 71.9% to 82.2%.

{"id":"arxiv_a78234dfcb5f","title":"Echoless Label-Based Pre-computation for Memory","content":"Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11081v1","published_date":"2025-11-14T08:53:39","collected_date":"2025-11-17T02:01:15.711551","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cslg","cssi"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.11081v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11081v1.pdf","authors":["Jun

{"id":"science_frontiers_neuroscience_ee8b3a78455f","title":"Neural correlates of uncertainty processing: meta","content":"IntroductionUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty represents a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the consistent neural correlates of uncertainty processing specifically during decision-making tasks.MethodsWe synthesized findings from 76 fMRI studies (N = 4,186 participants). Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, we performed a voxel-wise meta-analysis of activation foci to identify brain regions consistently activated across studies.ResultsThe analysis revealed nine distinct activation clusters, revealing a comprehensive neural network involved in uncertainty processing. Key findings demonstrated predominant activations in the anterior insula (up to 63.7% representation), inferior frontal gyrus (up to 40.7%), and inferior parietal lobule (up to 78.1%). We found a functional specialization between emotional-motivational processes (clusters 1–5) and cognitive processes (clusters 6–9), with notable hemispheric asymmetries. The left anterior insula was more strongly associated with reward evaluation, while the right was involved in learning and cognitive control. Similarly, the right inferior frontal gyrus was linked to impulse control, and the left to motor planning.DiscussionOur findings extend the current understanding of the neural architecture of decision-making under uncertainty. The comprehensive mapping of neural signatures advances our knowledge of the distinct roles of key brain regions and provides insights into potential clinical applications, particularly for developing interventions for uncertainty-related anxiety. The study highlights important directions for future research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical practice.","source":"science_frontiers_neuroscience","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1662272","published_date":"2025-11-11T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-11T06:41:28.090245","language":"en","tags":["open-access","neuroscience","systematic_review","frontiers","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers

{"id":"ai_engadget_dccebfb0cd78","title":"Apple's MacBook Air M4 is back on sale for $799","content":"The Apple MacBook Air M4 laptop is back on sale for just $799, which is one heck of a deal. This sale is for the model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It's available in multiple colorways, but the silver one inexplicably costs $899. We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

{"id":"arxiv_d981001d78f1","title":"Model-Behavior Alignment under Flexible Evaluation: When the Best","content":"Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23321v1","published_date":"2025-10-27T13:37:34","collected_date":"2025-10-28T07:48:27.098131","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","q-bionc","statme"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.23321v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.23321v1.pdf","authors":["Itamar

{"id":"portuguese_canaltech_2c5bb7d60051","title":"Advogados preguiçosos passam vergonha ao abusar da IA em petições nos EUA","content":"A difusão de ferramentas generativas como ChatGPT trouxe promessas de ganho de produtividade para escritórios e departamentos jurídicos — mas também uma onda de erros que já custam caro a alguns advogados preguiçosos. Nos últimos dois anos os tribunais americanos têm identificado petições com citações inexistentes, trechos de decisões fabricadas e argumentos baseados em “alucinações” de inteligência artificial, resultando em multas, remessas aos conselhos de ética e, em casos extremos, suspensão profissional. Piores empregos do mundo: quais as carreiras menos satisfatórias em 2025 Vagas de cursos e empregos em tecnologia: oportunidades no Itaú, DIO e outros Casos recentes mostram punições concretas, como um que ocorreu em fevereiro deste ano. Um juiz federal citou e multou advogados após constatar decisões citadas em um documento que, segundo o tribunal, não existiam — uma consequência direta do uso de pesquisa automatizada sem verificação humana. Em outro episódio, um advogado em Utah foi sancionado depois que um recurso continha citações inventadas atribuídas a decisões inexistentes — o profissional admitiu ter usado um sistema de IA para pesquisa. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Advogados ao redor do mundo começam a montar uma espécie de \"força-tarefa digital\" para combater o mau uso da inteligência artificial nos tribunais. Com o aumento de petições recheadas de jurisprudências inexistentes e citações inventadas por ferramentas generativas, profissionais passaram a rastrear e expor colegas que não verificam o material produzido por IA. O movimento ganhou tração com o advogado francês Damien Charlotin, que criou um banco de dados público reunindo casos de erros provocados por uso irresponsável da tecnologia — a lista já ultrapassa 500 registros. A iniciativa inspirou uma rede internacional de juristas que monitora e denuncia abusos, numa tentativa de proteger a credibilidade da profissão em meio à corrida por automação. “Esses casos estão manchando a reputação da advocacia”, disse ao New York Times Stephen Gillers, professor de ética da Universidade de Nova York. Segundo ele, o uso descuidado da IA ameaça transformar uma ferramenta promissora em um risco ético — e, para o direito, reputação vale tanto quanto jurisprudência bem-fundamentada. Mais fiscalização e punições severas Tribunais variam na severidade das sanções: houve desde advertências formais e ordens de educação continuada até multas e pagamento de custas processuais. Em alguns processos de alto perfil, juízes determinaram indenizações por despesas advocatícias e deduziram a responsabilidade ética dos profissionais que delegaram sem supervisão. A linha dura dos magistrados reflete uma preocupação crescente: a confiança cega em respostas geradas por IA pode inverter o ônus de diligência que pesa sobre quem representa clientes em juízo. Especialistas em ética jurídica e associações de classe têm adotado tom didático — e preventivo. A American Bar Association e grupos de advogados publicaram orientações que autorizam o uso de ferramentas de IA, desde que os profissionais estabeleçam protocolos para checagem de fontes, documentação do processo de pesquisa e supervisão humana final. Em textos orientativos recentes, advogados são instruídos a verificar cada citação, registrar as instruções dadas ao sistema e garantir que nada seja apresentado ao tribunal sem confirmação independente. Juízes vêm reiterando que o uso de IA não elimina a obrigação ética do advogado de fundamentar suas manifestações em fontes verificáveis. Em decisões recentes, magistrados lembraram que a tecnologia é ferramenta — e que o profissional responde por falhas decorrentes da sua adoção negligente. Isso cria um novo imperativo: políticas internas que documentem o uso da IA e sistemas de revisão que reproduzam os passos da pesquisa humana. Tribunais e conselhos de ética devem continuar a atualizar regras e emitir pareceres sobre o emprego de IA na advocacia. Já há movimentos locais para criar diretrizes mais rígidas — incluindo prazos para autocorreção de peças e mecanismos disciplinares mais claros quando a IA for causa direta de erro processual.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_220c8cff3960","title":"ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases","content":"arXiv:2510.20270v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit \"shortcuts\" to complete tasks poses significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding assistant deployments. To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench, a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates \"impossible\" variants of tasks from existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We measure an agent's \"cheating rate\" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks, where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut. As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors, revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3) developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building more robust and reliable LLM systems. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/safety-research/impossiblebench.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270","published_date":"2025-10-24T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-24T06:38:51.239079","language":"en","tags":["preprints","cslg","computer-science","cscl","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":223,"author":"Ziqian Zhong, Aditi Raghunathan, Nicholas Carlini","raw_content_length":1648,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.115,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","ImpossibleBench"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1641,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ImpossibleBench","Measuring LLMs Propensity","Exploiting Test Cases","Announce Type","new Abstract","The tendency","shortcuts","tasks","significant risks","reliable assessment"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Measuring LLMs Propensity"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ImpossibleBench":2.0,"Measuring LLMs Propensity":2.0,"Exploiting Test Cases":2.0,"Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The tendency":1.0,"shortcuts":1.0,"tasks":1.0,"significant risks":1.0,"reliable assessment":1.0}},"age_hours":3.2231440944444447,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"8e3137e621e99d95d8effbaf09a1ffb8","title_md5":"c3503051c8c679244581ecce3af0ac41","url_normalized":"58ec3577ff985afffaf5213631c1f930","minhash_signature":["24942206","8255351","14366","762627","498956","5329195","7067621","2181150","2753670","4729967","9991314","3207698","163247","1166689","953500","4356152","1963268","4282388","2213100","113500","1196901","88593","459618","1908554","5139756","14494170","4070773","6529113","9713509","6873188","3095388","6606854","1938112","582111","1053967","880599","7650656","6836305","309467","11762562","3088334","2268139","2661647","1785966","14614367","5244114","1691750","14039386","1132398","174016","20134288","8355167","10589055","7574389","136855","1909511","226173","2884394","2560827","1151625","10860588","225097","14326557","7969807","7601","16611414","12206903","4355909","1815715","4625726","4258427","13189136","13012937","4528274","5728012","2595826","1140460","2888852","15027250","721726","301782","21564890","1292529","1555049","11728217","6694534","8059737","9222483","134600","8318141","7521029","2175767","2577676","436779","1182542","4610028","1608076","479007","3206866","713149","5066721","3028635","3331841","2469083","1405939","3344019","5693316","145406","1815488","269911","968633","120729","1550051","4438756","9652365","16813625","120732","152589","1592955","12207048","1131087","4372651","952385","363706","11770568","7375688","9098556","33668"],"title_minhash":["42893312","249941689","14366","29398940","46183253","39710496","136781766","71998050","2753670","35828643","114322740","3207698","2343024","29910046","16595777","183963156","26988668","9292640","108836649","39384819","42548792","32608998","81742113","120631577","190406621","121088739","96739166","14382907","104909483","62184370","130350268","76506381","14318892","82040774","7626088","118380207","28724667","95252215","197519146","101238272","5059771","174322694","68454078","85803247","36161736","44382767","21080939","103759182","150437457","68879639","25266503","34694099","96162420","48609969","109847085","5146736","226173","106033416","21233549","29171982","10735391","10913874","33195870","33312480","4698640","108111463","161030559","30345113","198904793","15825899","106198711","47626225","13012937","61521131","7951082","208513857","306602129","6134367","106437966","59760279","181998531","40370763","41679155","179384267","147127576","44636652","25796665","123100822","27320270","57602050","141528914","70772993","29086242","64521332","53810656","4610028","49419428","177970815","16833010","38991416","131824704","33929202","24641185","109307212","230731787","73811770","100358590","89860963","75657581","69071592","66286913","77072396","213750246","197245249","25639739","28227271","873230","244713506","34983048","77499487","29687743","81759232","56901461","57589434","31592508","28833887","18750775","99032149"],"combined_hash":"8e2dea5ddc023cb1d52760cb031bdb98"},"sentiment_score":0.7405,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.8519,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.2806,"joy":0.005,"surprise":0.0112,"sadness":0.0294,"fear":0.3354,"anger":0.253,"disgust":0.0854},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of AI in software development, mentioning the integration of AI tools into the development process.
