{"id":"industry_intelligence_fast_company_b1aac04e6bed","title":"Agentic AI isn’t always the answer","content":"When it comes to agentic artificial intelligence, the fear of missing out factor is clear. Organizations are plopping down agents, in part, because that’s what everyone else seems to be doing. But FOMO is not a business strategy. To make agentic AI work, business leaders need to ignore the hype and concentrate on establishing exactly what agents can do for them, how, and at what cost. Our own work has proved that AI agents, which independently plan and execute complex multistep tasks, can deliver substantial value by accelerating timelines and reducing costs. And that is just the start. The ever-improving ability of AI agents to work with people to plan, communicate, and learn, could evolve into a genuine paradigm shift in how business is done. Unclear business value But enthusiasm does not always translate into impact, something that many businesses are beginning to recognize. According to one study, 40% of agentic AI projects could be canceled by the end of 2027 due to unclear business value and escalating costs. In recent research, McKinsey studied dozens of agentic AI initiatives, including 50 in which we were directly involved. With the wisdom of hindsight, we’ve identified three critical factors in agentic AI success. 1. Start with workflows, not agents Agentic transformations are more likely to succeed when they focus on integrating agents into reimagined workflows, rather than tacking agents onto processes designed for another technological era. And the corollary is also true: even the most powerful AI agent will underperform if it is tethered to faulty and inefficient workflows. Already, agents are being successfully deployed in multi-step, dynamic workflows like IT help desks, software development, and customer service. The boldest leaders are also successfully deploying agents to frontier use cases. For example, an alternative legal services provider found substantial efficiency gains when it carefully modernized its contract review process. Every time a lawyer made a change in the document editor, it was logged, categorized, and fed back into the agent’s logic and knowledge base. In designing the agentic workflow, the team identified where, when, and how to integrate human input. Agents highlighted edge cases and anomalies for people to review. Over time, the agents were able to codify new expertise and provide more sophisticated legal reasoning, but it was up to the lawyers to sign off on critical decisions. 2. Stop the slop Many enthusiastic early adopters built agents whose outputs have become known as “slop”—that is, work that may be done quickly but then requires considerable effort to correct. This is annoying. Worse, it breeds distrust in the agents and in the idea of transformation more generally. To do better, companies should invest in agents just as systematically as they do in people, with managers, job descriptions, training, monitoring, and continuous development goals. 3. To support AI agents, engage the workforce It should be humans who onboard, train, and evaluate agents on an ongoing basis: “launch and leave” is not good enough. As agents begin to accomplish more, roles will shift. Leaders will need to train employees in a new human-agent hybrid operating model, including skills such as building and deploying agents effectively, training them, setting tasks for them, tracking and correcting their work, and stringing them together to perform more complex tasks. The essential principle is that agentic AI needs to work with, not against, time-honored business priorities like productivity and teamwork. The question, then, is not whether to deploy agents, as with any other technology, it is when can they help to solve real-world problems and create value? And the answer is: not always. For tasks related to parsing lengthy documents, generative AI applications such as chatbots are probably the better option. For highly structured or automated tasks like data entry, rules-based approaches—if x, then y—can be more efficient. And high-stakes decisions with little room for error are the domain of leaders and managers. Yes, agentic AI could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity—thus the FOMO effect. Success will come not from enthusiasm, however, but from a hard-headed analysis of how this tool can be used wisely—for the right task, at the right time.","source":"industry_intelligence_fast_company","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91436597/agentic-ai-isnt-always-the-answeragentic-ai","published_date":"2025-11-12T12:04:00","collected_date":"2025-11-12T12:56:46.999215","language":"en","tags":["innovation","technology","business","tech"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Fast Company","source_category":"industry_intelligence","word_count":683,"author":"Stephen Xu","raw_content_length":8204,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":3.415,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Agentic AI"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":4350,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Agentic AI","the answer","agents","agentic artificial intelligence","the fear","factor","Organizations","part","what","everyone"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Agentic AI","agentic artificial intelligence"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Agentic AI":2.0,"the answer":2.0,"agents":2.0,"agentic artificial intelligence":1.0,"the fear":1.0,"factor":1.0,"Organizations":1.0,"part":1.0,"what":1.0,"everyone":1.0}},"age_hours":1.132799493888889,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"e0f838f378db2a47654c62ce7f572d20","title_md5":"703264d3318f9c012ac15869ab12d95a","url_normalized":"9271c6ee24534dd14fff55fe2a54ca3a","minhash_signature":["9837667","3830695","4229889","11617828","498956","4313235","4626937","2181150","1062486","4729967","3134393","3646982","2343024","1166689","953500","4356152","3016691","304913","178409","113500","1196901","88593","459618","2113985","1198033","487712","4070773","3686074","354593","3101601","2169913","6606854","189431","582111","1053967","880599","221068","2305781","296674","6977948","2394106","792666","2661647","1785966","907738","5244114","449615","13623637","1132398","3467375","8582904","843096","396872","4194521","136855","1909511","6518056","6045037","2560827","1151625","3404386","1311296","387463","4050641","7601","4770883","7366789","1563117","1815715","4625726","473069","1755940","10044336","405748","5728012","2595826","269839","2433691","407005","7421795","301782","1969868","3972917","8572837","442394","379140","4602115","1290376","1442738","8318141","343266","2175767","8261531","436779","13402462","2064468","1608076","479007","11483721","713149","243170","551087","3331841","2469083","129586","3344019","2193094","2447857","1815488","44001","4034866","120729","2086119","76161","756656","1943155","120732","1144143","1592955","1696344","1131087","4372651","952385","363706","10047967","809487","9098556","33668"],"title_minhash":["118921048","261319123","118581467","85348515","40636443","19580689","36631559","26817878","13724237","134695259","77151084","165225300","104519738","312060570","190456287","207396287","244948064","117050714","118868354","27620326","1196901","88576204","54507159","130885671","487961160","9666441","133054612","82211595","412278699","19810598","154695797","287328143","5807442","55747269","216261503","27257070","142168664","317367784","345454477","188383203","69510542","168910277","85790220","354468629","31437849","36428735","26507739","98140387","88367448","115805945","47935054","74487567","219119608","32494267","38860551","13331872","12603413","26056709","131549198","22715680","116114321","219700561","210206419","122469979","24536753","16611414","21803903","167498033","38718724","94841074","346931176","203627481","79144332","4528274","101159263","64300191","131959069","186329730","318392121","286475091","178554445","141995345","20999682","162834571","465913241","8605786","89679683","70866040","367858159","52981936","206924971","46415650","74747864","279031851","288603584","161775002","1608076","36104052","103476410","77742152","35948365","128389885","91136911","16291765","79487425","668922525","154330650","2447857","97764910","27769953","143443154","331605376","82266086","12152184","111333663","77874438","260414914","211647733","71458350","8134440","7095581","268339610","75794758","291359028","25518271","41210887","214082058","45227134"],"combined_hash":"be8f4f9eb7007f36d622220e43484a8a"},"sentiment_score":2.6165,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.4767,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.4819,"joy":0.0054,"surprise":0.0147,"sadness":0.0058,"fear":0.4586,"anger":0.021,"disgust":0.0127},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":6.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of LLMs for code generation and repair, mentioning steps like prompting, code generation, and testing.

{"id":"community_social_reddit_machine_learning_9f162f1f7e42","title":"My experience deploying an ML","content":"Years back, after finishing my CS degree, I got into algorithmic trading as a personal project. It felt like the perfect arena to push my skills in coding, data science, and, most importantly, data engineering. After a long road of development, I recently deployed my first fully automated, ML-driven system. The trading results aren't the point of this post. I'm here to talk about the steps I've taken to solve the fundamental problem of getting a machine learning model to perform in a live environment exactly as it did during historical testing. A live production environment is hostile to determinism. Unlike a sterile backtest where all data is known, a live system deals with a relentless, ordered stream of events. This introduces two critical failure modes: Lookahead Bias: The risk of accidentally using information from the future to make a decision in the past. A live system must be architected to be a strict \"tape reader,\" ensuring it only ever acts on information that has already occurred. State Drift: A more insidious problem where the system's internal \"memory\"‚Äîits representation of the world, built from the stream of incoming data‚Äîslowly but surely drifts away from the ground truth of the historical environment. The live model ends up seeing a distorted reality compared to the one it was trained on, rendering its predictions meaningless. It's important to note that training a model on features containing lookahead bias will often cause state drift, but not all state drift is caused by lookahead bias. My entire development process was engineered to prevent both. My first principle was to enforce a strict, row-by-row processing model for all historical data. There are countless ways lookahead bias can creep into a feature engineering pipeline, but the most tempting source I found was from trying to optimize for performance. Using vectorized pandas operations or multi-threading is standard practice, but for a stateful, sequential problem, it's a minefield. While I'm sure there are pandas wizards who can vectorize my preprocessing without causing leaks, I'm not one of them. I chose to make a deliberate trade-off: I sacrificed raw performance for provable correctness. My solution is a \"golden master\" script that uses the exact same stateful classes the live bot will use. It feeds the entire historical dataset through these classes one row at a time, simulating a live \"tape reader.\" At the end of its run, it saves the final state of every component into a single file. While this is much slower than a vectorized approach, it's the cornerstone of the system's determinism. The live bot's startup process is now brutally simple: it loads the state file from the golden master. It doesn't build its own state; it restores it. It only has to process the short data gap between the end of the golden master's run and the current moment. This makes the live system easier to debug and guarantees a perfect, deterministic handover from the historical environment. Finally, I have the validator. This tool also starts from the same \"golden master\" state and re-processes the exact same raw data the live bot saw during its run. The goal is a Pearson correlation of 1.0 between the live bot's predictions and the validator's predictions. Anything less than a perfect correlation indicates a logical divergence that must be found and fixed. This project has been an incredible learning experience, but the biggest lesson was in humility. The most complex challenges weren't in model architecture but in the meticulous data engineering required to create a provably consistent bridge between the historical and the live environments. While my actual trading models are private, I have a lower-frequency version of the system that posts market updates and predictions. After running live for over three weeks, it maintained a >0.9999 correlation with its validator - shown in the attached picture. It's currently offline for some upgrades but will be back online in a few days. You can see it here: https://x.com/ZtenlEssej Thanks for reading.

{"id":"ai_ai_alignment_forum_82b83ba2145d","title":"Rogue internal deployments via external APIs","content":"Published on October 15, 2025 7:34 PM GMTtl;dr: A heavily-monitored internally deployed AI with sensitive access (e.g. to model weights) could bypass safety controls by asking a weakly-monitored external API version of itself (or another AI) what to do. It could then use its privileged access to execute instructions that the external API generated under less monitoring.Once AI companies build powerful AIs, they may:Give internal AIs access to sensitive internal privileges (e.g. access to the internal infra that touches model weights, help with training of the next generation of AIs, …);Have mitigations specific to those internal deployments enforced via monitoring of the internal LLM API;Have an external API deployment without those mitigations.In this situation, an internal AI may build an agent scaffold that makes calls to the external API and uses the internal sensitive privileges. Such agent scaffold would be in a better position to cause a catastrophe because it would not be subject to the same monitoring as the internal API. I call this a rogue internal deployment via external APIs. (It is “internal” because the model weights and the agent scaffold never leave the cluster.)I think preventing those is similarly important from a misalignment perspective as preventing LLM weight exfiltration (aka rogue external deployments) or regular rogue internal deployments where the AI hacks its own datacenter to run unmonitored LLM inference.This post explores this threat as well as potential mitigations. Overall, I think this is a threat that is relatively hard to mitigate. It is potentially a central example of a threat that probably requires fancy control measures (not “just trusted monitoring” or “just security”, probably a combination of trusted monitoring with some dedicated security measures, or something that fully leverages untrusted monitoring).Rogue internal deployments via external APIsLet’s say a scheming superhuman AI researcher (SAIR) is running inside OpenMind, and OpenMind is monitoring its actions via a monitor looking at all the traffic that goes through the internal API. Some human and a lot of AI labor is spent ensuring that no SAIR generation that goes out of the internal API would sabotage the security of OpenMind or the alignment of the next generation of AIs.But in contrast to AI2027, let’s imagine that the SAIR is also deployed externally not long after it started being deployed internally. The versions deployed externally are not used to modify the infra or align the next generation of OpenMind AIs but they are also less carefully monitored (more on why in “Monitoring the external API”).In such a situation, a scheming SAIR running internally (on the internal API, with internal permissions) could spin up an internal job with sensitive internal permissions that makes queries to OpenMind’s external API (more on why it may have access to it in “Preventing access to external APIs”) and executes the actions suggested by the external API.The internal SAIR also makes sure that in the prompt sent to the external SAIR there is enough information for the external SAIR to understand the situation. And now you have a situation where a barely-monitored external SAIR can write code and misleading research proposals that will be executed and acted on using the sensitive internal privileges of OpenMind - aka the SAIR successfully set up a rogue deployment!A variation: rogue internal deployments via cross-company APIsNote that this might be a concern even if OpenMind doesn’t have an external API, as long as another AI company (e.g DeepCent) has an external API that serves a frontier scheming model. In this case, instead of sending queries to the external OpenMind API, OpenMind’s SAIR could send queries to the DeepCent API.While AI companies might try to prevent this just to avoid sending their secrets to their competitors, I don’t think this means this problem will be solved by default.It does make the situation better that OpenMind AIs have much fewer plausible reasons to interact with DeepCent’s API than OpenMind’s API, but because DeepCent (and other actors that can wrap OpenMind or DeepCent’s API) might want to access OpenMind’s secrets, it means that scheming AIs might get a lot of help from outsiders setting up a scaffold that sends requests to an external LLM API. A possible mitigation: preventing the creation of scaffolds that use external LLM APIs via monitoringThe intervention that seems most promising to me is to monitor the code that internal AIs write and block attempts at creating code that both accesses sensitive internal permissions and gives LLMs accessed via external APIs the ability to interact at length with sensitive internal permissions.A variant of this could be to plug the monitoring and the control interventions in the agent scaffolds and the PR review system and use monitoring to ensure modification to these systems don’t unplug the monitor (and don’t redirect them to a less trusted LLM API).This monitoring task can be somewhat difficult, but I am hopeful that certain security measures can help monitors do a decent job at this. For example:With the right permissions, you could reduce the amount of generated code with both internet access and sensitive internal permissions, which helps focus monitoring efforts in the right place and reduce the effects of false positives elsewhere;With enough API-key hygiene, you could make it difficult for an internal scaffold (with sensitive internal permissions and internet access) to find external LLM API keys “by accident” (and actively looking for them would be more suspicious).This is not as effective when the LLM gets help from outside attackers that are trying to get AI company secrets since such attacker-provided endpoints might not even need API keys, but getting the instructions on how to access such external help might also be blatantly bad to a monitor. While this prevents direct code/research agent sabotage, it does not prevent things like the external LLM API producing ideas for how to perform sabotage. This problem seems trickier to solve, and figuring out how big of an issue this is involves thinking about steganographic communication and encoded reasoning, which is out-of-scope for this post.Why I am more pessimistic about other solutionsMonitoring the external APII think monitoring external LLM APIs can help, but that is unlikely to be sufficient.Why not just monitor the external API like you monitor the internal API?Traffic understanding. You might not understand external LLM API traffic as well as internal traffic. If you want to know if some usage is red-teaming, or sandboxed usage, or sensitive usage, you can ask people inside the company, but you usually can’t ask external API users as easily (and it is harder to verify their claims).Cost. This lack of understanding means it could be harder to focus monitoring effort in the right place and take more drastic and costly measures to prevent potentially catastrophic actions during the most sensitive usage. This can result in large costs, both in the amount of AI and human labor spent reviewing less sensitive parts of the traffic, and usefulness cost when applying interventions to parts of the traffic that are less sensitive. External traffic might also be much bigger than internal traffic (though it depends on the economics of intelligence explosions, and seems plausible only in longer timelines where the AI R&D returns to AI labor are small).User privacy. User privacy might limit how much in-depth monitoring you can do. Companies often care a lot that AI companies can’t read their LLM usage, and this might be hard to change. This hinders human monitoring.Coordination. If the external LLM API is built by DeepCent, it is hard for OpenMind to make sure DeepCent's monitoring is good enough to prevent catastrophes from happening.The main way I can see it as being sufficient is if all actors carefully monitor and block any usage that looks like it has access to internal resources of AI companies in order to avoid speeding up other AI companies - but that seems unlikely to me given the current trajectory, and it might be technically difficult to detect such traffic without preventing general software engineering and research.Preventing access to external APIsI think blocking access to external APIs is something that can help reduce the amount of code that is run that has the security permissions to access both the internet and sensitive internal permissions, but I would be surprised if it could drive it to something negligible.Why not just block internet access or block access to the relevant websites?There are malicious human actors that will help AIs get these permissions because routing such traffic would let you access valuable secrets. This means that targeted bans might not suffice.Not giving AIs internet access would probably be a large tax on SAIR productivity - interacting with the internet is useful in many ways, especially in the world where there are external APIs (as the external world would also massively use large amounts of AI labor in ways which are almost surely relevant to staying competitive).And even if you solved the problem of LLM API proxies, there are good reasons to sometimes give your SAIR access to external LLM APIs and sensitive internal permissions, for example when improving the external LLM API or when trying to learn from the API of other model providers. It might be possible to mostly eliminate this risk by splitting sensitive resources, but it is unclear how costly such division of sensitive resources would be.Monitoring access to sensitive permissionsOne last way you can prevent a catastrophe from happening is monitoring the usage of sensitive permissions. I think this is a valid way to reduce risk, and would probably be hard to bypass - which makes this “rogue” internal deployment via external APIs not totally rogue. But I’d still be surprised if it enabled reducing risk by more than 50%.Final thoughtsOverall I find this particular threat somewhat concerning, though not less tractable than other forms of rogue internal deployments.On a more meta-level, I find it concerning that I found this new way in which AIs could set up rogue deployments roughly a year after having first tried to catalog ways in which AIs could set up a rogue deployment.Discuss","source":"ai_ai_alignment_forum","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fqRmcuspZuYBNiQuQ/rogue-internal-deployments-via-external-apis","published_date":"2025-10-15T19:34:34","collected_date":"2025-10-16T06:42:06.065157","language":"en","tags":["research","ai-safety","alignment"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"AI Alignment Forum","source_category":"ai","word_count":1668,"author":"Fabien Roger","raw_content_length":12449,"priority":9,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":8.34,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["LLM","API"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":10406,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Rogue internal deployments","external APIs","October","sensitive access","weights","safety controls","a weakly-monitored external API version","itself","another AI","what"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["another AI"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Rogue internal deployments":2.0,"external APIs":2.0,"October":1.0,"sensitive access":1.0,"weights":1.0,"safety controls":1.0,"a weakly-monitored external API version":1.0,"itself":1.0,"another AI":1.0,"what":1.0}},"age_hours":11.218698118055555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":9.088000000000001,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.8176,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.3134,"joy":0.0074,"surprise":0.0161,"sadness":0.0247,"fear":0.3038,"anger":0.2514,"disgust":0.0832},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of AI in software development, mentioning the integration of AI tools into various stages of the software development lifecycle.

Le pedí a Gemini que generara diferentes vistas de un \"estampador\": una vista frontal, una vista trasera, una vista de perfil y una isométrica. El resultado fue bastante impresionante: Las imágenes generadas por la IA me sirvieron como una base muy sólida para crear un modelo 3D bastante decente. Aunque la topología aún requiere trabajo manual para ser óptima, y la texturización está un paso más allá (sigue siendo un proceso bastante artesanal para lograr resultados de alta calidad), el punto de partida que ofrece la IA es innegable. Esto me lleva a una serie de preguntas que creo que son cruciales para la comunidad de artistas 3D y desarrolladores: ¿El proceso de creación de assets 3D sigue siendo fundamentalmente \"artesanal\"? A pesar de los avances en la IA, ¿cuánto de la creación de un asset de calidad AAA sigue dependiendo de la habilidad y el toque humano? ¿Qué tecnologías están por liderar la industria del modelado 3D? ¿Veremos un salto masivo en herramientas asistidas por IA que automaticen gran parte del proceso, desde la creación de modelos hasta la texturización y el rigging? ¿El trabajo está \"muerto\" para los modeladores 3D, o qué le espera al artista 3D del futuro? Personalmente, no creo que el trabajo esté 4muerto, sino que está evolucionando. Pero, ¿hacia dónde? ¿Se necesitará más especialización o más generalismo?

In this paper, we examine evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a two-agent metaprompting system where a \"thinker\" large language model (LLM) agent refines gameplay strategies for an \"executor\" LLM agent, and a single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends (correlation $\\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement, highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20205v1","published_date":"2025-10-23T04:45:05","collected_date":"2025-10-25T06:41:12.322251","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","csai"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.20205v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20205v1.pdf","authors":["Maggie

{"id":"portuguese_canaltech_ab05291a60ad","title":"Gemini 3 é a nova IA mais potente e criativa do Google; veja novidades","content":"O Google anunciou nesta terça-feira (18) o novo modelo de IA Gemini 3, considerado o mais inteligente da empresa até o momento. O LLM tem melhorias nas habilidades de programação e consegue criar mais experiências interativas e multimodais. Como usar a IA Gemini do Google | Guia Prático Gemini Flash e Pro: quando é indicado usar cada modelo de IA do Google? A novidade já está disponível para todas as contas no aplicativo do Gemini e no Modo IA da pesquisa do Google — é a primeira vez que a empresa libera um modelo novo simultaneamente para o chatbot e para o buscador. Na experiência geral, a Gigante de Mountain View destaca que a IA gera respostas mais inteligentes e concisas. Na parte de programação, o vibe coding segue em alta com um modelo mais inteligente para as tarefas relacionadas à àrea. -Entre no Canal do WhatsApp do Canaltech e fique por dentro das últimas notícias sobre tecnologia, lançamentos, dicas e tutoriais incríveis.- Novidades do Gemini Veja os destaques do salto de geração: Interfaces generativas Maior compreensão multimodal Novo visual no app Busca mais inteligente Novo Google Antigravity Interfaces generativas Pela primeira vez, o Google traz interfaces generativas ao Gemini para criar plataformas visuais e interativas completas durante uma conversa normal com o chatbot. São dois novos recursos — Visual Layout (“Diagramação visual”, em tradução livre) e Dynamic View (“Visualização dinâmica”). O primeiro cria uma experiência mais imersiva da pesquisa, com fotos, vídeos e tabelas, como se a pessoa visitasse um site especializado no assunto. A segunda opção consegue criar uma interface em tempo real, como um aplicativo que roda na web. Como exemplo, o Google pediu para o Gemini criar um espaço para explicar a trajetória de Vincent van Gogh com suas respectivas obras e o pedido foi atendido. Gemini 3 consegue criar interfaces em poucos segundos a partir de prompts simples (Imagem: Divulgação/Google) Maior compreensão multimodal A Gigante das Buscas destaca a evolução multimodal da IA, com desempenhos superiores nos testes de benchmark que envolvem prompts com diferentes formatos de mídia. Além de entender comandos em voz, texto, imagem, vídeo e código, o Gemini 3 consegue identificar particularidades de cada prompt e adaptá-las para diferentes formatos. Mandar uma imagem e pedir para extrair as principais anotações pode ter resultados melhores, por exemplo. Novo visual no app O aplicativo do Gemini para celulares ganhou algumas mudanças. Agora, é possível acessar uma aba com as suas mídias mais recentes, ideal para quem gera muitas imagens com o Nano Banana, além de acessar comandos rápidos para as principais funções da IA. Busca mais inteligente O Gemini 3 chegou ao Modo IA da busca para trazer resultados mais completos e até interativos. Há um novo modo “Thinking”, voltado para pesquisas complexas e que precisam de um tempo maior para gerar uma resposta. Assim como a OpenAI faz com o ChatGPT, o Google pretende implementar um roteador para decidir automaticamente se aquele prompt exige um modelo mais poderoso ou uma alternativa mais rápida. O modo no buscador ainda consegue criar experiências mais interativas e com maior apelo visual, adaptadas em tempo real de acordo com os pedidos do usuário. Modo IA da busca conta com função que usa o modelo Pro, considerado o mais avançado da família Gemini 3(Imagem: Divulgação/Google) Novo Google Antigravity A empresa revelou a nova plataforma Antigravity, voltada para desenvolvimento com uso de agentes de IA.

You check the logs and still have no clue what happened. That is exactly why we built OpenLIT Operator. It gives you observability for LLMs and AI agents without touching your code, rebuilding containers, or redeploying. ‚úÖ Traces every LLM, agent, and tool call automatically ‚úÖ Shows latency, cost, token usage, and errors ‚úÖ Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, AgentCore, Ollama, and others ‚úÖ Connects with OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Jaeger, and Prometheus ‚úÖ Runs anywhere like Docker, Helm, or Kubernetes You can set it up once and start seeing everything in a few minutes. It also works with any OpenTelemetry instrumentations like Openinference or anything custom you have.
