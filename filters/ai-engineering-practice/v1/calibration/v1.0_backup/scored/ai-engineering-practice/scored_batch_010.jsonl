At first, AI could only generate text. Then it got search: now it can access real-time information. Then came tools and the ability to write and execute code, which basically unlocked infinite potential. Then RAG arrived: allowing models to tap into custom knowledge bases and context dynamically. When you combine all of this, LLMs aren’t just chatbots anymore. They’re practically digital brains that can interact with the real world. For example, you can now automate your entire house, from waking you up, turning on and off lights dynamically, managing your schedule, and even making you breakfast. All powered by GPT-5 or similar models. Basically Jarvis real life. Yet 90% of people still see AI as “a fancy Siri that talks better.” So I’m curious, what are some of the other hidden or mind-blowing capabilities of modern AI models that most people have no idea about? Stuff that’s not widely known but insanely powerful or creative. submitted by /u/Abivarman123 [link] [comments]","source":"community_social_reddit_chatgpt","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o4d6qc/what_are_the_hidden_or_underrated_capabilities_of/","published_date":"2025-10-12T02:04:40","collected_date":"2025-10-12T06:38:49.760057","language":"en","tags":["llm","reddit","chatgpt","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"ChatGPT","source_category":"community_social","word_count":185,"author":"/u/Abivarman123","raw_content_length":1726,"priority":6,"update_frequency":6,"reading_time_minutes":0.925,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["RAG"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1113,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["most people","What","the hidden or underrated capabilities","text","just a chatbot","the reality","search","real-time information","tools","the ability"],"filter_categories":{"healthcare_tech":["search"],"research_academic":["search"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"most people":3.0,"What":2.0,"the hidden or underrated capabilities":2.0,"text":2.0,"just a chatbot":1.0,"the reality":1.0,"search":1.0,"real-time information":1.0,"tools":1.0,"the ability":1.0}},"age_hours":4.8894963225,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":8.7895,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7579,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.543,"joy":0.0029,"surprise":0.4106,"sadness":0.0031,"fear":0.0036,"anger":0.0185,"disgust":0.0183},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The article discusses the use of AI in software development, including code generation and testing, but lacks specific details on the steps involved in these workflows.

{"id":"arxiv_9f10639bcac7","title":"Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy","content":"Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \\cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \\JADESeleven, \\JADESzthirteen, \\JADESfz, and \\JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122v1","published_date":"2025-11-06T07:11:00","collected_date":"2025-11-07T12:56:27.928920","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","astro-phim","astro-phco"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.04122v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04122v1.pdf","authors":["Adiba

{"id":"arxiv_18a94ec97264","title":"SmartMLOps Studio: Design of an LLM","content":"The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) applications has intensified the demand for integrated environments that unify model development, deployment, and monitoring. Traditional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) focus primarily on code authoring, lacking intelligent support for the full ML lifecycle, while existing MLOps platforms remain detached from the coding workflow. To address this gap, this study proposes the design of an LLM-Integrated IDE with automated MLOps pipelines that enables continuous model development and monitoring within a single environment. The proposed system embeds a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant capable of code generation, debugging recommendation, and automatic pipeline configuration. The backend incorporates automated data validation, feature storage, drift detection, retraining triggers, and CI/CD deployment orchestration. This framework was implemented in a prototype named SmartMLOps Studio and evaluated using classification and forecasting tasks on the UCI Adult and M5 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartMLOps Studio reduces pipeline configuration time by 61%, improves experiment reproducibility by 45%, and increases drift detection accuracy by 14% compared to traditional workflows. By bridging intelligent code assistance and automated operational pipelines, this research establishes a novel paradigm for AI engineering - transforming the IDE from a static coding tool into a dynamic, lifecycle-aware intelligent platform for scalable and efficient model development.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01850v1","published_date":"2025-11-03T18:56:59","collected_date":"2025-11-05T06:55:34.645460","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","csse","csai"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.01850v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01850v1.pdf","authors":["Jiawei

{"id":"arxiv_899a61df6aeb","title":"FAST","content":"The Surface Brightness Fluctuation method is one of the most reliable and efficient ways of measuring distances to galaxies within 100 Mpc. While recent implementations have increasingly relied on space-based observations, SBF remains effective when applied to ground-based data. In particular, deep, wide-field imaging surveys with sub-arcsecond seeing conditions allows us for accurate SBF measurements across large samples of galaxies. With the upcoming next generation wide-area imaging surveys, the thousands of galaxies suitable for SBF measurements will give us the opportunity to constrain the 3D structure of the local universe. We present FAST-SBF, a new Python-based pipeline for measuring SBF, developed to support the analysis of large datasets from upcoming wide-field imaging surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and Roman. The procedure, still in the testing and development stage, is designed for automation and minimal user intervention, offering a fast and flexible approach to SBF distance estimation. We validate the performance of the procedure on high-quality imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), a precursor to LSST, analyzing a sample of both luminous early-type galaxies and fainter dwarfs. Our measurements are also compared with recent results from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) and with the SPoT stellar population synthesis models. The results show excellent agreement with published distances, with the capability of measuring the SBF signal also for faint dwarf galaxies. The pipeline allows the user to completely analyze a galaxy in relatively short time ($\\approx$ minutes) and significantly reduces the need for user intervention. reduces at minimum the user intervention.

{"id":"arxiv_bea00b374fe6","title":"Verifiable Split Learning via zk","content":"Split learning is an approach to collaborative learning in which a deep neural network is divided into two parts: client-side and server-side at a cut layer. The client side executes its model using its raw input data and sends the intermediate activation to the server side. This configuration architecture is very useful for enabling collaborative training when data or resources are separated between devices. However, split learning lacks the ability to verify the correctness and honesty of the computations that are performed and exchanged between the parties. To this purpose, this paper proposes a verifiable split learning framework that integrates a zk-SNARK proof to ensure correctness and verifiability. The zk-SNARK proof and verification are generated for both sides in forward propagation and backward propagation on the server side, guaranteeing verifiability on both sides. The verifiable split learning architecture is compared to a blockchain-enabled system for the same deep learning network, one that records updates but without generating the zero-knowledge proof. From the comparison, it can be deduced that applying the zk-SNARK test achieves verifiability and correctness, while blockchains are lightweight but unverifiable.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01356v1","published_date":"2025-11-03T09:05:07","collected_date":"2025-11-05T18:45:18.105399","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cslg"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.01356v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01356v1.pdf","authors":["Rana Alaa","Darío González-Ferreiro","Carlos Beis-Penedo","Manuel Fernández-Veiga","Rebeca P.

{"id":"arxiv_29da9138f646","title":"Accelerated Prediction of Temperature","content":"Lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $κ_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $κ_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data obtained from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $κ_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $κ_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $κ_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $κ_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler compounds and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $κ_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $κ_L$ for thermoelectric applications.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13202v2","published_date":"2025-11-17T10:14:40","collected_date":"2025-11-19T02:00:59.333567","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cond-matmtrl-sci"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.13202v2","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13202v2.pdf","authors":["Piyush

{"id":"arxiv_fe518354e5fa","title":"SoK: Honeypots & LLMs, More Than the Sum of Their Parts?","content":"The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to resolve the long-standing paradox in honeypot design: achieving high-fidelity deception with low operational risk. However, despite a flurry of research since late 2022, progress has been incremental, and the field lacks a cohesive understanding of the emerging architectural patterns, core challenges, and evaluation paradigms. To fill this gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper provides the first comprehensive overview of this new domain. We survey and systematize three critical, intersecting research areas: first, we provide a taxonomy of honeypot detection vectors, structuring the core problems that LLM-based realism must solve; second, we synthesize the emerging literature on LLM-honeypots, identifying a canonical architecture and key evaluation trends; and third, we chart the evolutionary path of honeypot log analysis, from simple data reduction to automated intelligence generation.
