{"id":"arxiv_f97cbd03d1ae","title":"The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL","content":"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17057v1","published_date":"2025-10-20T00:24:08","collected_date":"2025-10-21T14:28:15.039945","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cslg","csai"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.17057v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17057v1.pdf","authors":["Nikolaus Howe","Micah Carroll"],"categories":["cs.LG","cs.AI"],"paper_type":"preprint","source_api":"arxiv","word_count":242,"author_count":2,"entities":{"organizations":["CoT","LLM"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1705,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["The Ends","the Thoughts","The use","reinforcement learning","thought","a promising approach","more capable language models","turn","investigation","a compelling method"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["reinforcement learning"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"The Ends":2.0,"the Thoughts":2.0,"The use":1.0,"reinforcement learning":1.0,"thought":1.0,"a promising approach":1.0,"more capable language models":1.0,"turn":1.0,"investigation":1.0,"a compelling method":1.0}},"age_hours":38.38125742361111,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"e10c3529d12563c88e613ae479182be0","title_md5":"d52f13b8a6bd6dce34fe24d202948b9c","url_normalized":"09d6c7bc2b89c791bcb2bca01a6b7c3a","minhash_signature":["9837667","10475553","14366","13560711","498956","15249449","4380964","187877","2753670","4729967","5968903","2763186","3162861","1166689","953500","2834307","11167650","10786263","178409","113500","1196901","1457998","459618","13461341","6284996","14494170","7507083","17179148","3333020","18277207","2169913","1613769","5807442","2820767","1053967","880599","8422360","6836305","309467","18336194","5059771","3329444","10333426","1350112","6374280","2720336","449615","4152219","1132398","11619362","2447249","843096","6725716","7574389","136855","3592616","7015836","7750562","4430687","1151625","2318646","7144066","12323739","2492803","7601","4770883","9932183","3779347","7564697","4625726","10000710","2173563","4549584","4528274","5260768","2595826","1140460","6134367","13987518","9168221","10619331","21564890","3972917","20005884","1207127","2319043","4602115","2033222","1442738","8318141","504781","2175767","9012833","436779","5979754","2999489","1608076","479007","15352116","713149","4227644","3028635","12264772","2469083","1684279","3376316","2193094","2559501","1815488","6841584","4034866","120729","4549477","76161","9652365","23544853","120732","1144143","1592955","20025063","3554160","6684355","952385","7407467","9144084","1376388","9098556","5084848"],"title_minhash":["51458759","259230883","262158227","129377938","136245013","27419980","4626937","185058001","175938478","19256427","15126115","109086628","28879825","21417468","6784057","133307831","298400583","246803287","142791089","8219252","363089496","334618446","1386815","13461341","57281913","227982446","100292922","91347368","390740093","188027543","295862049","69629627","266716304","95416449","109036925","27257070","159143138","487190987","7167732","328905212","12167310","102669578","229242995","130038671","166348655","36428735","117874248","39322878","123841621","115805945","214802355","64939931","47240016","169412426","51371197","13331872","13936994","111303546","112527938","46640628","52803160","59059947","340306866","130925272","193930444","146235664","43469950","179982471","39322970","50497025","83566552","303249150","20394408","237080925","51832356","346202513","55741265","69744608","19424592","82985260","178554445","795866804","61802790","28555544","873476887","40409302","626728921","143590005","469241405","149779877","176150004","68029334","58663362","57248588","523233122","79776607","60540987","43573138","221503598","83240420","182986064","69769600","418692477","181196945","82477679","347097328","90470250","529086706","97764910","289001328","82282607","326277403","446696675","34288765","9652365","41453233","138850708","112026425","59877544","250118869","16727492","178332301","952385","335104640","258304089","98712791","55400095","37319798"],"combined_hash":"14019d9deec6ad2cfaf33dd86cbbdae3"},"sentiment_score":9.5585,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.9117,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.7043,"joy":0.0097,"surprise":0.0047,"sadness":0.0149,"fear":0.0154,"anger":0.0897,"disgust":0.1615},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"practitioner_account","workflow_detail":{"score":7.0,"evidence":"The author details their use of Copilot for generating boilerplate code, writing unit tests, and refactoring existing code.

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_110f4b6d2bb6","title":"Recommendations for Useful AI Search Tools","content":"The core value of AI search tools is that they are fundamentally changing how we interact with information. Traditional search engines provide an \"index,\" requiring users to click links, read, filter, and synthesize answers for themselves. AI search, however, attempts to bypass these intermediate steps by directly understanding complex user intent, integrating web information, and generating a relatively complete, ready-to-use \"answer.\" This \"answer-driven\" experience is iterating rapidly, and many excellent products with different approaches have emerged. Each has its own focus and is suited for different needs. Perplexity AI: The Rigorous Answer Engine Perplexity AI is perhaps the product that best represents the \"answer engine\" model today. Its interface is extremely minimalist, centered entirely around the question-and-answer workflow. Perplexity's real strength lies in its rigorous handling of sources. In its generated answers, it clearly cites every piece of information with superscript numbers linking directly to the source URL. This feature makes it ideal for scenarios requiring fact-checking and source verification, such as writing reports, academic research, or in-depth reading. Furthermore, Perplexity offers a \"Focus\" feature, allowing users to narrow the search scope to specific domains like \"Academic,\" \"Writing,\" or \"YouTube\" to get more precise, vertical answers. Microsoft Copilot: The Deeply Integrated All-in-One Assistant Microsoft's Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) is the prime example of a tech giant deeply integrating AI with search. Backed by the Microsoft ecosystem, it combines advanced GPT models (like GPT-4) with Bing's real-time search capabilities. Copilot's advantage lies not just in its \"timeliness\" but in its deep \"ecosystem integration.\" It is seamlessly built into the Edge sidebar, the Windows operating system, and standalone apps, making it nearly ubiquitous. Copilot is more than just a search engine; it functions more like an \"all-in-one\" comprehensive assistant. Beyond text-based Q&A, it can handle complex image analysis (\"What does this chart mean?\") and high-quality image generation (based on DALL-E 3), making it a partner that can assist with both creative and executive tasks. Google Search's AI Overviews As the giant in traditional search, Google hasn't launched a standalone \"AI search\" product. Instead, it has chosen to fully integrate its AI capabilities into the existing search experience. This is what users now frequently see at the top of the results page: \"AI Overviews.\" This represents an \"enhancement\" rather than a \"revolutionary\" strategy. AI Overviews attempt to provide a highly summarized answer before the user even skims the list of blue links, which is especially useful for how-to guides or factual queries. This approach preserves the user's habit of clicking links while adding an AI-generated answer as a supplement, striking a balance to improve efficiency without drastically changing user habits. Phind: The Professional Choice for Developers Phind is an AI search engine that has deeply specialized in a vertical field: programming. It is specifically optimized for the needs of developers and technical professionals, and its performance on coding questions far exceeds that of general-purpose AI search tools. When a user searches for a technical problem, debugs a bug, or queries API usage for a specific library, Phind not only provides an accurate explanation but also generates high-quality, usable code snippets. It understands technical context and can synthesize solutions by combining the latest technical documentation, Stack Overflow discussions, and GitHub repositories. For programmers, it acts like an experienced \"pair programming\" partner, greatly increasing problem-solving efficiency. Arc Search: Innovating the Mobile Search Experience Arc Search, from The Browser Company, is a mobile (currently iOS-focused) search app that offers a bold innovation in user experience. Its core feature is \"Browse for me.\" When a user types a query, Arc Search doesn't just show a list of results. Instead, it \"browses\" and reads multiple relevant web pages for the user, then digests, summarizes, and organizes all the information. Finally, it generates a custom, richly formatted \"webpage\" built just for that query. This process is like having a personal assistant do all the initial research for you. This experience is particularly well-suited for mobile, as it completely solves the pain point of constantly switching between tabs on a small screen to compare information. Consensus: The Evidence-Based Tool for Academic Research Consensus is another vertically-focused AI search tool, aimed primarily at academic researchers, students, journalists, and anyone who needs \"scientific evidence.\" Unlike Phind's focus on coding, the Consensus database is composed entirely of scientific papers and academic literature. Its specialty is its ability to accurately extract \"research conclusions\" from a vast library of papers in response to a direct question. For example, you can ask, \"Is [a specific diet] effective for health?\" and Consensus will search relevant papers and summarize the scientific community's findings and mainstream conclusions. It helps users cut through the noise of commercial marketing and personal blogs to get straight to evidence-based answers. You.com: The Highly Customizable Search Portal You.com was one of the earlier explorers in the AI search space, and its key characteristic is its high degree of customization. It allows users to switch between different AI modes, such as a fact-oriented \"Smart\" mode or a creative-oriented \"Genius\" mode. However, its core differentiator is the integration of \"Apps.\" The You.com results page is not a traditional vertical list but rather a card-based horizontal layout. These cards can pull information from user-specified sources, such as Reddit, Stack Overflow, shopping sites, or specific news outlets. Users can prioritize these \"Apps,\" allowing them to build a highly personalized information portal. Komo Search: Focusing on Community and Real Discussions Komo Search is a relatively new AI search engine that emphasizes privacy and a \"de-SEO-ed\" approach. One of Komo's notable features is that it heavily values authentic user discussions from forums and social media (especially Reddit). In traditional search engines, the top results are often heavily search-engine-optimized (SEO) commercial content or marketing articles. Komo attempts to bypass this content to unearth the genuine experiences and opinions of ordinary users. When a user wants to find firsthand reviews of a product or real discussions about a niche hobby, Komo can often provide more authentic, \"down-to-earth\" results than traditional search. Summary The development of AI search tools is in a highly active phase and is showing a clear trend of \"divergence.\" We no longer have just one \"one-size-fits-all\" search engine. Whether it's answer engines like Perplexity that pursue factual rigor, all-in-one assistants like Copilot that are deeply integrated into operating systems, or specialized tools like Phind and Consensus that are masters of specific domains, they are all developing toward the goal of being \"faster, more accurate, and more direct.\" Which one to choose depends more on the user's specific needs in a given situation.","source":"community_social_dev_to","source_type":"rss","url":"https://dev.to/serenepine/recommendations-for-useful-ai-search-tools-1ceg","published_date":"2025-11-06T06:09:35","collected_date":"2025-11-06T06:41:54.978987","language":"en","tags":["trends","community","developer","tutorials","community_social"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"DEV

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_d3221888ad74","title":"🏁 ASPICE Literacy: Episode 7 — Management Buy","content":"\"ASPICE shows the cracks. Courage decides if you fix them — or paint over them.\" The assessment is over. Results are in. 📊 The self-image many held — \"we're doing fine\" — just diverged violently from the mirror ASPICE held up. Some are still in shock. Others are already in damage-control mode. At this moment, the spotlight moves to leadership. Because what happens next isn't about templates, or work products, or tailoring. It's about courage. Courage to face the cracks in the walls and ask: are they just cosmetic, or do they expose shaky foundations? 🏚️ Without that courage at the top, ASPICE becomes theater. 🎭 Leadership decides whether ASPICE is a mirror for improvement or just stage lighting for a performance. (Gemini generated image) 🎭 The Illusion of Buy-In On paper, management often loves ASPICE: Green dashboards. ✅ Certificates on the wall. Steering committees full of slides. But symbols aren't substance. Lip service sounds like this: \"We want quality - but don't miss the deadline.\" ⏰ The outcome: a culture where theater flourishes. A developer learns to log a test as passed for a requirement never fully implemented — because raising a defect would \"cause problems\". Lip service is not buy-in. (Gemini generated image) ⭕ Case in Point: The Hollow ASPICE Initiative A classic scenario, seen in many companies: the assessment is over, results are in, and leadership steps in to reinterpret the pain away. The Scene: The assessment results meeting. Weaknesses are exposed. Ratings are lower than expected. The Lines & The Translation: \"We still deliver good software regardless of ASPICE results.\" → Classic minimization: refusing to confront that quality isn't as strong as assumed. Denying the relevance of ASPICE. \"Do we even need architecture or detailed design?\" 🏗️ → Classic short-termism: skipping rigor to deliver faster, at long-term cost. \"Maybe we just go for low-hanging fruit to get higher ratings.\" 🍒 → Classic cosmetic compliance: gaming the assessment instead of fixing root causes. These aren't isolated remarks - they are the classic refrain of leadership avoiding uncomfortable truths. Cosmetic compliance never fixed a shaky foundation. (Gemini generated image) 🛡️ Why ASPICE Needs Courage at the Top Real leadership buy-in isn't about budgets or dashboards - it's about courage: 🛑 Courage to say no: stop shipments when processes aren't followed. 🛡️ Courage to defend engineers: protect truth-tellers who escalate issues. 🛠️ Courage to fund the boring: reviews, tests, tool improvements. 🚩 Courage to accept bad news early: resist burying red flags under \"green\". 🤹 Classic Management Failure Modes When courage is missing, familiar archetypes take the stage. Each looks convincing at first glance - but each quietly sabotages ASPICE from within. The Paper Tiger 🐅: Invests in glossy process documents but ignores execution - a facade of compliance that collapses in reality. The Deadline Dictator ⏰: Cuts corners under pressure, then blames engineers when ASPICE scores crash. The Outsourcing Optimist 🌍: Assumes suppliers will \"handle ASPICE\" without oversight. The Consultant Addict 💼: Buys glossy slideware instead of making structural changes. Underlying all of them is a lack of trust in teams - as if engineers cannot be trusted to understand ASPICE without layers of theater above them. Failure modes: different costumes, same play. (Gemini generated image) ✅ What Real Buy-In Looks Like Real buy-in is visible, concrete, and behavioral: 👀 Leaders attend reviews and assessments — not just steering committees. ⏳ Resources are allocated: a percentage of sprint capacity is ringfenced for process and tooling. 🏆 Incentives are aligned: performance reviews reward long-term quality, not only short-term output. 🙋 Leaders model behavior: no \"exceptions for me\". Buy-in means protecting truth-tellers, not punishing them. (Gemini generated image) 💰📈 Selling the Leadership Case Why should leaders care? Because ASPICE courage pays off where it matters most: Predictability 📅: fewer late-stage surprises. Lower Total Cost 💰: catching defects early is exponentially cheaper. Reputation 🌟: quality becomes a brand advantage that survives beyond one project or one bonus cycle. This isn't just a quality argument. It's a business argument. ⚖️ 🚩 Closing Punchline ASPICE fails without leadership courage. Tailoring (Episode 6) and evidence (Episode 5) only work if management accepts the cost of honesty. Otherwise, projects drift into theater — the PowerPoint Project (Episode 8). Leadership courage isn't measured in the color of your dashboard - it's measured in the number of times you chose a red flag today over a field failure tomorrow. 🚩 🔖 If you found this perspective helpful, follow me for more insights on software quality, testing strategies, and ASPICE in practice. © 2025 Abdul Osman.

{"id":"arxiv_d81baeff9c07","title":"Evaluation of Wafer-Scale SOT","content":"Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure 300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2 ns) and low voltage (<1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25853v1","published_date":"2025-10-29T18:00:39","collected_date":"2025-10-31T02:55:43.270586","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cond-matmes-hall"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.25853v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25853v1.pdf","authors":["Samuel Liu","Chen-Yu Hu","Xinyu Bao","Ming-Yuan Song","Jean Anne C.

Current methods for managing disaster-related rumors rely on static, rule-based approaches that lack scalability, fail to capture nuanced misinformation, and are limited to reactive responses, hindering effective disaster management. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and event knowledge graphs (EKGs) to facilitate the sustainable agile identification and adaptive control of disaster-related online rumors. The framework follows a multi-stage process, which includes the collection and preprocessing of disaster-related online data, the application of Gaussian Mixture Wasserstein Autoencoders (GMWAEs) for sentiment and rumor analysis, and the development of EKGs to enrich the understanding and reasoning of disaster events. Additionally, an enhanced model for rumor identification and risk control is introduced, utilizing Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to extract node features for accurate rumor detection and prediction of rumor propagation paths. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of the proposed methodology in improving disaster response. This study contributes novel theoretical insights and presents practical, scalable solutions for rumor control and risk management during crises.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8920","published_date":"2025-10-08T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-08T12:53:53.529725","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":198,"author":"Xin Chen","raw_content_length":1502,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.99,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Adaptive Risk Control"],"persons":["EKGs Amid","Gaussian Mi"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1502,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Sustainability","Pages","Major Disaster Online Rumors","LLMs","EKGs","the increasing frequency","severity","major disasters","the rapid spread","online misinformation"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Major Disaster Online Rumors":2.0,"LLMs":2.0,"EKGs":2.0,"the increasing frequency":1.0,"severity":1.0,"major disasters":1.0,"the rapid spread":1.0,"online misinformation":1.0}},"age_hours":13.001187425,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":0.242,"sentiment_category":"negative","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":-0.9516,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":true,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.5058,"joy":0.0048,"surprise":0.0109,"sadness":0.0208,"fear":0.4112,"anger":0.0283,"disgust":0.018},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The article discusses the use of AI in software development, mentioning the integration of AI tools into the development process.

{"id":"arxiv_0b069ed90cdb","title":"Renormalization group for deep neural networks: Universality of learning and scaling laws","content":"Self-similarity, where observables at different length scales exhibit similar behavior, is ubiquitous in natural systems. Such systems are typically characterized by power-law correlations and universality, and are studied using the powerful framework of the renormalization group (RG). Intriguingly, power laws and weak forms of universality also pervade real-world datasets and deep learning models, motivating the application of RG ideas to the analysis of deep learning. In this work, we develop an RG framework to analyze self-similarity and its breakdown in learning curves for a class of weakly non-linear (non-lazy) neural networks trained on power-law distributed data. Features often neglected in standard treatments -- such as spectrum discreteness and lack of translation invariance -- lead to both quantitative and qualitative departures from conventional perturbative RG. In particular, we find that the concept of scaling intervals naturally replaces that of scaling dimensions. Despite these differences, the framework retains key RG features: it enables the classification of perturbations as relevant or irrelevant, and reveals a form of universality at large data limits, governed by a Gaussian Process-like UV fixed point.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25553v1","published_date":"2025-10-29T14:20:13","collected_date":"2025-10-30T07:13:58.807954","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cond-matdis-nn"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.25553v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25553v1.pdf","authors":["Gorka

{"id":"community_social_reddit_artificial_8f1a9482b1f0","title":"Top 10 Best AI Chatbots for Websites in 2025","content":"I‚Äôve been testing a lot of website AI chatbots lately, not just the big enterprise ones but also smaller tools that real startups and solo founders can actually use. After trying around different ones, here‚Äôs my honest list of the Top 10 AI chatbots for websites in 2025, based on setup time, features, pricing, and how natural their responses actually feel. 1. ChatQube ChatQube is one of the most interesting newer tools this year. It‚Äôs made for AI customer support directly on websites. You can train it on your web pages or uploaded files, and it works right away without coding. One thing I found really useful is that when someone asks a question it doesn‚Äôt know, it notifies you automatically so you can see exactly what your visitors are confused about and improve your content or training. Another cool thing is if your business is, for example \"web hosting\" you don‚Äôt have to train it on general hosting questions because it already Knows the topic, so you only need to train it on your specific services. Main features: Train on website pages or uploaded files Instant ‚ÄúKnowledge gap‚Äù notifications Context-aware answers (knows about your niche) Simple script embed, no coding Works 24/7 as a support agent Ticketing system 2. Intercom Fin Intercom‚Äôs AI assistant is one of the most advanced for large support teams. It connects to your docs, chat history, and customer data. It‚Äôs accurate but definitely aimed at enterprise users. Key features: Built into the Intercom platform Excellent FAQ accuracy Enterprise-grade reporting 3. Drift Drift‚Äôs chatbot is designed more for marketing than pure support. It helps capture leads and book meetings directly from the chat window. Key features: Lead qualification and meeting scheduling CRM integration Strong for B2B and SaaS sites 4. Tidio Tidio is a good pick for small businesses or eCommerce. You can combine AI and human live chat easily. Key features: Shopify and WooCommerce integration Pre-built conversation flows Affordable starter plan 5. Crisp Crisp offers an all-in-one messaging platform with a built-in AI bot. It‚Äôs flexible and developer-friendly. Key features: Unified inbox with automation Multi-channel support (email, chat, social) API customization 6. Chatbase Chatbase is focused on simplicity. You just give it a website link or upload content, and it trains automatically. It‚Äôs ideal if you just want something quick and clean. Key features: Web and document training (document training sometimes not working) No-code setup Simple embedding 7. Zendesk AI Zendesk‚Äôs AI bot is more of an extension of their support system. It helps automate tickets and direct users to help articles. Key features: Works with Zendesk tickets Knowledge base integration Reliable for large support teams 8. Botpress Botpress is an open-source chatbot framework. It gives full control over how your chatbot behaves, but you‚Äôll need some dev skills. Key features: Open-source and self-hostable Modular design Full customization with APIs 9. Flowise Flowise is for people who like building AI logic visually. You can connect APIs, add conditions, and design chatbot flows like a mind map. Key features: Visual no-code builder LLM-based logic Great for custom flows 10. Kommunicate Kommunicate blends AI automation with human handoff. It‚Äôs useful for smaller companies that still want live chat when needed. Key features: AI and human hybrid support WhatsApp and Messenger integration Easy to maintain Final Notes If you‚Äôre looking for something simple that feels personal, ChatQube and Tidio are the easiest to set up and manage. For bigger operations or integrations, Intercom and Zendesk are hard to beat. Developers who want full control will probably prefer Botpress or Flowise. AI chatbots have become a lot more practical this year. They‚Äôre not just for big brands anymore. submitted by /u/malki-abdessamad [link]

{"id":"economics_nber_working_papers_c76d5085c2a1","title":"The Ripple Effects of China’s College Expansion on American Universities -","content":"China’s unprecedented expansion of higher education in 1999, increased annual college enrollment from 1 million to 9.6 million by 2020. We trace the global ripple effects of that expansion by examining its impact on US graduate education and local economies surrounding college towns. Combining administrative data from China’s college admissions system and US visa data, we leverage the centralized quota system governing Chinese college admissions for identification and present three key findings. First, the expansion of Chinese undergraduate education drove graduate student flows to the US: every additional 100 college graduates in China led to 3.6 Chinese graduate students in the US. Second, Chinese master’s students generated positive spillovers, driving the birth of new master’s programs, and increasing the number of other international and American master’s students, particularly in STEM fields. And third, the influx of international students supported local economies around college towns, raising job creation rates outside the universities, as well. Our findings highlight how domestic education policy in one country can reshape the academic and economic landscape of another through student migration and its broader spillovers.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34391#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.699560","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.699593","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National

{"id":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen_02a1e296f181","title":"Brug over Gronings Van Starkenborghkanaal nog dagen dicht na aanvaring","content":"Een brug over het Van Starkenborghkanaal bij het Groningse Dorkwerd is beschadigd geraakt doordat er een schip tegenaan is gevaren. Als gevolg van de aanvaring blijft de brug de komende dagen afgesloten voor wegverkeer, meldt Rijkswaterstaat. Het schip botste rond 10.00 uur op de Dorkwerderbrug. Zowel het schip als de brug raakten daarbij beschadigd. Rijkswaterstaat kwam ter plaatse voor onderzoek en om de schade vast te stellen. Tijdens de inspectie werd duidelijk dat de brug niet helemaal naar behoren werkte. De Dorkwerderbrug is een zogenoemde tafelbrug, waarbij het wegdek omhoog wordt getild. \"Bij de inspectie aan wal is de brug opgetild\", legt een woordvoerder van Rijkswaterstaat uit. \"Bij het naar beneden gaan is de brug vast komen te zitten, waardoor het wegdek momenteel 5 centimeter hoger ligt.\" Brug dagen afgesloten Hoelang de brug blijft afgesloten, is nog niet duidelijk. \"De stremming duurt in elk geval tot en met maandag, waarschijnlijk langer\", aldus Rijkswaterstaat. Hoe de aanvaring heeft kunnen gebeuren is niet duidelijk. Rond de tijd van het ongeluk was het in Groningen erg mistig. Of de dichte mist er iets mee te maken heeft, durft Rijkswaterstaat niet te zeggen. \"Scheepvaart is gewend om in het donker te varen, ook wel met mist\", zegt een woordvoerder tegen RTV Noord. In Groningen veroorzaakte de dichte mist al de hele dag problemen. Zo zijn op Groningen Airport Eelde diverse vluchten geannuleerd. Een toestel van TUI, dat onderweg was van Schiphol naar Eelde om passagiers op te halen op weg naar Gran Canaria, kon vanmiddag vanwege de mist niet landen en keerde terug naar Schiphol, meldt RTV Drenthe. Code geel Een woordvoerder van Groningen Airport Eelde liet rond 18.00 uur weten dat de situatie op de luchthaven nog altijd hetzelfde is. \"Het is nog erg mistig, dus per vlucht moet bekeken worden wat mogelijk is.\" Volgens de woordvoerder is het niet zo dat alle vluchten zijn geannuleerd. In het noorden van het land geldt code geel vanwege dichte mist. Het zicht is plaatselijk minder dan 200 meter, wat kan leiden tot verkeershinder. De waarschuwing geldt voor de provincies Friesland, Groningen en Drenthe.","source":"dutch_news_nos_algemeen","source_type":"rss","url":"https://nos.nl/l/2589598","published_date":"2025-11-07T18:48:21","collected_date":"2025-11-08T01:49:17.497831","language":"nl","tags":["mainstream","nederland","dutch_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"NOS Nieuws","source_category":"dutch_news","word_count":348,"author":null,"raw_content_length":2575,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.74,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":["Gronings Van Starkenborghkanaal"],"locations":["Hoelang","Rijkswaterstaat"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2156,"language_detected":"nl","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["de brug","Brug","nog dagen","dicht na aanvaring","Een brug","een schip","gevolg","de aanvaring","de komende dagen","wegverkeer"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"de brug":3.0,"Brug":2.0,"nog dagen":2.0,"dicht na aanvaring":2.0,"Een brug":1.0,"een schip":1.0,"gevolg":1.0,"de aanvaring":1.0,"de komende dagen":1.0,"wegverkeer":1.0}},"age_hours":7.6604058380555555,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"4d4fd724248019de140acf264006fe8e","title_md5":"4ea6eab054f6bf939ec704713d287b2d","url_normalized":"ff91de4fb2aa3c834652f0e1097a7279","minhash_signature":["7636397","10092163","14366","11617828","13624839","9427212","14786822","5024283","693538","10835656","3134393","14244073","3550252","489351","953500","56890","4205984","1929019","9722371","618847","1868191","88593","459618","2113985","4659612","1882961","14187664","11149543","25570738","1569407","4713903","587492","2518573","2820767","1090859","15811535","5241720","5887665","1839125","14319770","3082913","11233144","23489097","195857","907738","7369333","1691750","1115709","1132398","3467375","2447249","843096","4286247","4194521","3063247","1914246","12603413","8715546","4430687","4797292","4334793","1311296","6372115","5603612","2058924","7416491","2940560","1563117","13478095","5493975","7249981","2440745","4090701","848513","4991972","3487483","264176","2433691","11560535","7421795","1246369","1544236","1812598","3999196","6335518","6694534","7112617","2033222","2840755","12144713","343266","17372915","1183835","6019554","12786202","4610028","2811152","11684906","2168581","14703780","243170","3028635","3045718","5292934","1684279","5537010","6419416","2447857","2860778","44001","4034866","5937854","12141412","76161","756656","13776844","120732","13762129","10101258","9862215","6123858","4372651","1797871","363706","9075580","1376388","9098556","9825718"],"title_minhash":["16524246","163305779","4229889","99319327","29217502","118331823","15676671","17819323","21098000","77877653","108048950","22661111","80646343","84220333","16595777","198098084","62534645","6594476","126903871","59130892","76792896","58982039","36779676","108838117","21393102","8563067","32400429","25707534","58894886","46931810","4713903","132074927","5807442","34963712","14343807","60820682","65062819","52992162","11403421","27290270","184162404","18176858","49136923","154908809","20869166","27824875","1691750","38063290","180868314","217948958","161582589","74487567","16936868","38444919","61582642","38394965","63750470","25474425","4430687","35327763","10643667","178950313","145845271","124109694","99439815","89552121","78801110","61706186","22955553","15825899","22107507","16223695","8703424","848513","54229304","23960916","31489473","134285362","13987518","59760279","1246369","62408873","13911005","8572837","11728217","6694534","16694763","139398903","58121912","106757614","25686349","81346669","43246372","16277282","103807689","63224393","26132335","14235446","27734480","38991416","243170","127127506","14554737","5758998","1806145","28700530","6419416","19952876","182702272","7559602","7059192","28947671","29409507","46167775","72631637","142941657","873230","75647842","35694045","60855503","11288622","8564697","7331411","96076189","62941593","15208201","37293134","19260898"],"combined_hash":"63a6fb5d3610fb9a1596263f4e243361"},"sentiment_score":5.0,"sentiment_category":"neutral","sentiment_confidence":"low","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.0,"is_positive":false,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":true,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.616,"joy":0.0169,"surprise":0.1355,"sadness":0.0508,"fear":0.0561,"anger":0.0608,"disgust":0.064},"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"research_study","workflow_detail":{"score":5.0,"evidence":"The paper discusses the use of AI in software development, mentioning tasks like code generation and testing, but lacks specific details on the steps and decision points involved in these workflows.
