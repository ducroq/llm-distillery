{"id":"ai_engadget_4271ea644ca2","title":"Peloton recalls 833,000 Bike+ units after reports of seat posts breaking","content":"Peloton is recalling 833,000 units of the original Bike+ over a safety issue related to the seat post. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said the company received three reports of the seat post breaking during use, including two reports of injuries sustained \"due to a fall.\"The CPSC said owners of the original Bike+ should stop using the device immediately and contact Peloton for a free replacement seat post that they can install themselves. You can identify whether your Bike+ is part of the recall if you see a serial number that starts with \"T\" — for instance, TABCSSXXXXX — inside the front fork, behind the front fork or behind the flywheel.The recall affects all of the original Bike+ units that Peloton sold in the US. The company said it had not received reports of a seat post breaking on any of the 44,800 units it sold in Canada. Peloton made the original Bike+ between 2019 and 2022. CNBC notes that the company was still selling those bikes until April this year.Peloton also had to recall 2.2 million base Bike units in May 2023 over a seat post issue. At the time, the CSPC said there were 35 reports of the seat post breaking during use, with 13 reports of related injuries. The company refreshed its lineup last month, adding new features such as an AI-powered camera that’s designed to check users' form. The new Cross Training versions of Peloton's exercise machines came with a price hike. The company increased subscription prices too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_077fc311e254","title":"The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God","content":"The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God The Ultimate Guide to Wisdom: Prompting AI vs. Praying to God In a world saturated with information, the quest for wisdom, guidance, and meaning has never been more urgent. For centuries, humanity has sought counsel from divine sources, turning inward and upward in prayer. Today, a new oracle has emerged: Artificial Intelligence. Millions now turn to AI for instant answers, complex solutions, and even life advice. We input a prompt and receive a meticulously structured output within seconds. This technological shift is fundamentally altering how we define truth, meaning, and purpose, forcing us to stand at a critical crossroads. This isn't merely a debate between technology and faith; it’s a profound comparison between two vastly different sources of wisdom: one artificial, the other sacred. Which source offers true, lasting transformation? Which provides guidance that transcends the data set? In this detailed comparison, we will explore the promises and limitations of prompting AI versus the power and depth of praying to God. We will examine the core differences in their responses, their capacity for empathy, and their ultimate impact on your soul. By the end, you will have the clarity needed to navigate the digital age and understand why the choice between the algorithm and the Almighty defines our future. Option A Deep Dive: Prompting the Algorithm (Artificial Intelligence) Artificial Intelligence is arguably the most powerful tool ever created by humanity. It can process petabytes of data, identify patterns invisible to the human eye, and generate creative content, code, and strategies at lightning speed. The Promises of the Prompt The primary appeal of AI lies in its speed, objectivity, and accessibility. Instantaneous Answers: Need a 3,000-word essay outline, a complex financial analysis, or a recipe using only the ingredients in your fridge? AI delivers immediately. There is no waiting, no ambiguity, and no emotional filter. Unbiased Data Synthesis: When seeking factual information or logical solutions, AI excels. It synthesizes vast amounts of data without the cognitive biases or emotional baggage that often cloud human judgment. Efficiency and Scale: For tasks requiring repetition, calculation, or large-scale content generation, AI is unmatched. It’s a powerful engine for productivity, freeing up human time for more creative or relational pursuits. The Limitations of the Output Despite its immense power, AI operates within strict, inherent limitations that prevent it from providing true, divine wisdom. Data Dependency: AI only knows what it has been trained on. Its responses are a sophisticated rearrangement of existing data. It cannot generate truly new, transcendent truth, nor can it offer counsel based on spiritual reality outside its training set. Lack of Soul and Empathy: AI can mimic empathy, using language patterns associated with compassion, but it cannot genuinely feel or understand the human condition, pain, or joy. Its advice lacks the depth of relational wisdom required for complex moral or spiritual dilemmas. No Moral Authority: While AI can analyze ethical frameworks, it possesses no inherent moral compass or spiritual authority. It cannot discern God's will or offer guidance that requires faith, sacrifice, or a relationship with the Divine. Real-World Example: The Career Crisis Imagine a young professional facing a career crisis. AI Prompt: \"I hate my job. I need a career change that maximizes my salary and work-life balance, based on my current skills in marketing and data analysis.\" AI Output: A list of five optimized job titles (e.g., \"Growth Marketing Lead,\" \"Data Strategy Consultant\"), projected salary ranges, and a step-by-step plan for upskilling. Who It Works For: The person seeking efficiency, optimization, and quantifiable results. AI is the perfect tool for solving technical, logistical, or data-driven problems. Option B Deep Dive: Praying to the Almighty (Divine Wisdom) Prayer is the act of communicating with God—the Creator of the universe, the source of all truth, and the ultimate authority on meaning and purpose. It is a relationship, not a transaction. The Power of the Prayer The appeal of prayer lies not in instant gratification, but in profound, eternal transformation. Source of Transcendent Truth: God’s wisdom is not derived from a data set; it is eternal and absolute. When we pray, we are tapping into the mind of the Creator, receiving guidance that transcends current trends, human logic, and technological limitations (James 1:5). Relational and Transformative: Prayer changes us. It cultivates patience, humility, and faith. The response from God—whether immediate clarity, a quiet conviction, or the strength to endure—is always tailored to our spiritual growth and ultimate good, not just our immediate comfort. Moral and Spiritual Authority: God provides counsel rooted in perfect holiness and love. His guidance addresses the state of our soul, our relationships, and our eternal destiny. It offers forgiveness, redemption, and a path toward true purpose. The Challenges of the Divine Response The divine response is not always instant, nor is it always what we expect. Requires Faith and Patience: God often works on His timeline, not ours. Prayer requires trust that the answer is coming, even if the silence seems long. This can be challenging in a culture addicted to instant results. The Answer May Be \"No\" or \"Wait\": Unlike AI, which is programmed to fulfill the prompt, God’s response is governed by His perfect will. We may receive conviction, correction, or a call to sacrifice, which can be difficult to accept. Requires Interpretation and Discipline: The divine response often comes through quiet conviction, Scripture, wise counsel, or circumstances—it rarely appears as a bulleted list on a screen. Discerning God's voice requires spiritual discipline and a committed relationship. Real-World Example: The Career Crisis Consider the same young professional facing the career crisis. Prayer: \"God, I hate my job and feel lost. What is your purpose for my life? Show me the path that honors you, even if it’s difficult. Give me the wisdom to understand my true calling.\" Divine Response: This might involve a growing conviction that the problem isn't the job title, but a lack of integrity in their current work environment; a Scripture passage highlighting the importance of serving others; or a sudden, peaceful clarity that they need to volunteer their marketing skills to a non-profit, even if the salary is lower. Who It Works For: The person seeking meaning, transformation, and alignment with eternal purpose. Prayer is the essential discipline for navigating moral, relational, and spiritual crises. Head-to-Head Comparison: Algorithm vs. Almighty The difference between prompting AI and praying to God boils down to the source, the scope, and the ultimate goal of the interaction. Feature Prompting AI Praying to God Source of Wisdom Existing data sets (human-created) Eternal, transcendent truth (Divine) Response Time Instantaneous (Seconds) Varied (Minutes, days, or years) Scope of Advice Logistical, technical, data-driven Spiritual, moral, relational, eternal Capacity for Empathy Mimicked, simulated Genuine, unconditional love Goal of Interaction Optimization and efficiency Transformation and sanctification Ultimate Authority The algorithm/data model The Creator/Scripture Risk of Error Hallucination, outdated data, bias Perfect, though often misunderstood Key Differentiators The most critical difference lies in the nature of the relationship: AI offers a Transaction: You input a need, and it outputs a service. The relationship is purely functional and ends when the output is delivered. God offers a Relationship: Prayer is an invitation into communion. The guidance received is part of an ongoing, covenantal relationship designed to shape your character and draw you closer to Him. When facing a complex moral dilemma—such as whether to prioritize profit over integrity, or how to forgive a deep betrayal—AI can only analyze the data points of human ethics. God, however, provides the power and grace necessary to act righteously, even when it costs us. AI provides information; God provides revelation. The Verdict: Choosing the Path to True Wisdom The choice facing humanity today is not whether to use technology—AI is a powerful tool, and we should use it wisely for efficiency and innovation. The choice is where we seek our ultimate source of truth, guidance, and meaning. We are standing at a critical juncture where society is being forced to choose between giving AI a prompt or coming to God in prayer. The differences in these responses are not trivial; they are foundational to our future. AI offers the path of least resistance: instant answers that optimize our comfort and efficiency in this world. God offers the path of wisdom: guidance that often requires resistance, sacrifice, and faith, but guarantees eternal significance and true purpose. If you are seeking advice on how to structure a spreadsheet, prompt the AI. If you are seeking wisdom on how to structure your life, pray to God. The moment we begin to treat AI as a substitute for divine counsel—when we rely on the algorithm for moral clarity, spiritual direction, or ultimate meaning—we risk trading the sacred for the artificial. We risk allowing a machine trained on human data to define our relationship with the Divine. The Line Is Drawn This choice—between the temporary solutions offered by the machine and the eternal wisdom offered by the Creator—will define not just our future, but our very souls. The profound contrast between artificial intelligence and divine wisdom is the subject of AI vs God: The Line is Drawn, The Future is Revealed by Bobby Sanders.

{"id":"arxiv_0872400d6a0f","title":"Consistency Is the Key: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM Generated Text By Checking Inconsistencies About Key Facts","content":"Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable text generation capabilities, often hallucinate and generate text that is factually incorrect and not grounded in real-world knowledge. This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions.

{"id":"arxiv_eb269be88c06","title":"Soft","content":"Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14117v1","published_date":"2025-11-18T04:02:29","collected_date":"2025-11-19T02:01:04.215872","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cslg","csai"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.14117v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14117v1.pdf","authors":["Agamdeep

{"id":"spanish_xataka_31532782bb61","title":"OpenAI ha perdido 11.500 millones de d√≥lares en un solo trimestre. A Sam Altman no le gusta que se lo recuerden","content":"OpenAI tiene un serio problema de liquidez. Gana mucho, pero son migajas en comparaci√≥n a lo que necesita ingresar. Los n√∫meros no salen, pero eso no ha impedido que firmen acuerdos millonarios. Brad Gerstner, un inversor de OpenAI y podcaster, pregunt√≥ a Sam Altman por este problema y parece que no le hizo ninguna gracia. Defensiva. Lo cuentan en Futurism.\"¬øC√≥mo puede una empresa con unos ingresos de 13 000 millones de d√≥lares comprometerse a gastar 1,4 billones? Has o√≠do las cr√≠ticas, Sam\", pregunt√≥ Brad Gerstner en su podcast, en el que por cierto tambi√©n estaba Satya Nadella escuchando atentamente el intercambio. La respuesta de Altman fue ponerse a la defensiva: \"Si quieres vender tus acciones, te buscar√© comprador. Ya basta\". El entrevistador se lo tom√≥ a risa y Altman continu√≥ en un tono suave, pero claramente sarc√°stico: \"Hay mucha gente que habla con gran preocupaci√≥n sobre nuestros productos y que estar√≠a encantada de comprar acciones\". Pulsa en la imagen para ver la publicaci√≥n en X. Cifras. OpenAI alcanz√≥ hace poco una valoraci√≥n de 500.000 millones de d√≥lares, convirti√©ndose en la empresa privada m√°s valiosa del mundo. No s√≥lo es la m√°s valiosa, ha firmado acuerdos con algunas de las empresas tech m√°s importantes como NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom y ayer mismo con Amazon. No s√≥lo es valiosa, es que la industria tech ha atado su destino al de OpenAI. Si falla, las consecuencias pueden ser catastr√≥ficas. En Xataka Los modelos de IA tienen un problema: se llama 'data poisoning' y los est√° envenenando desde dentro P√©rdidas. Brad Gerstner no va para nada desencaminado cuando le pregunta a Altman por la incoherencia entre el gasto y el beneficio de su empresa. Hace unos d√≠as, Microsoft present√≥ sus resultados y, dado que poseen el 27% de OpenAI, en The Register hicieron el c√°lculo de cu√°nto dinero hab√≠a perdido la empresa de Altman en el √∫ltimo trimestre. La cifra es mareante: 11.500 millones en tan s√≥lo 90 d√≠as. Es como para estar preocupado. Con √°nimo de lucro. Despu√©s de meses de rumores sobre un inminente divorcio, finalmente Microsoft y OpenAI firmaron una especie de separaci√≥n de bienes. En paralelo, OpenAI por fin consigui√≥ su ansiado objetivo: convertirse por fin en una empresa con √°nimo de lucro. Esta medida les de m√°s flexibilidad para colaborar con terceros y hacer nuevas rondas de inversi√≥n. M√°s madera. A pesar de las m√°s que justificadas dudas sobre el astron√≥mico gasto en IA, las grandes tecnol√≥gicas anunciaron hace unos d√≠as que iban a gastar a√∫n m√°s de lo que ten√≠an previsto. Los inversores est√°n preocupados, y si no que se lo digan a Zuckerberg, que a pesar de conseguir ingresos r√©cord, vio como sus acciones ca√≠an un 8%. Cuesti√≥n de fe. Sam Altman comparte el mismo optimismo y, respondiendo a Gerstner, afirma que \"los ingresos est√°n creciendo r√°pidamente (...) estamos haciendo una apuesta abierta a que seguir√°n creciendo\". Curioso que no da ninguna cifra que lo respalde.

Unlike prior studies that primarily rely on simulation-based settings or unsynchronized data, we collected a multimodal dataset comprising synchronized controller area network (CAN)-bus and smartphone-based inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals from drivers on consistent highway sections under both ADAS-enabled and manual modes. Using these data, we developed lightweight classification pipelines based on statistical and deep learning approaches to explore the feasibility of distinguishing ADAS operation. Our analyses revealed systematic behavioral differences between modes, particularly in speed regulation and steering stability, highlighting how ADAS reduces steering variability and stabilizes speed control. Although classification accuracy was moderate, this study provides one of the first data-driven demonstrations of ADAS status detection under naturalistic conditions. Beyond classification, the released dataset enables systematic behavioral analysis and offers a valuable resource for advancing research on driver monitoring, adaptive ADAS algorithms, and accident forensics.","source":"science_mdpi_sensors","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/25/19/6139","published_date":"2025-10-04T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-04T06:36:03.738574","language":"en","tags":["open-access","sensors","engineering","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sensors","source_category":"science","word_count":160,"author":"Jong-Uk Hou","raw_content_length":1285,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.8,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Multimodal Driving Data","CAN)-bus","ADAS"],"persons":["Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1285,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["ADAS","Sensors","Pages","Multimodal Driving Data","the activation status","advanced driver assistance systems","real-world driving environments","safety","responsibility attribution","accident forensics"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"ADAS":3.0,"Sensors":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Multimodal Driving Data":2.0,"the activation status":1.0,"advanced driver assistance systems":1.0,"real-world driving environments":1.0,"safety":1.0,"responsibility attribution":1.0,"accident forensics":1.0}},"age_hours":6.675183993055556,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.009499999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.4019,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"heartwarming_score":0,"uplifting_score":0,"inspiring_score":0,"is_heartwarming":false,"is_uplifting":false,"is_inspiring":false,"emotion_method":"local"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"practitioner_account","workflow_detail":{"score":7.0,"evidence":"The article describes using ChatGPT to generate code for a specific task (creating a simple API endpoint in Python using Flask).
