{"id":"arxiv_43ac0633a4f0","title":"The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education in Spain: Descriptive Analysis and International Perspectives","content":"AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI. The findings support the establishment of minimum standards and national monitoring of indicators.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17938v1","published_date":"2025-10-20T16:22:54","collected_date":"2025-10-22T06:51:59.878280","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cscy","csai","cshc","research_academic","research_academia"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.17938v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17938v1.pdf","authors":["Ana Enériz Janeiro","Karina Pitombeira Pereira","Julio Mayol","Javier Crespo","Fernando Carballo","Juan B.

{"id":"bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology_4461136e5302","title":"From molecules to medicine: a systematic review of Gastrodia elata’s bioactive metabolites and therapeutic potential","content":"The dried tuber of Gastrodia elata (GE), a perennial orchid with a 2,200-year medicinal history documented in the Shennong Bencaojing (200 BCE), remains a cornerstone of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and contemporary integrative therapies across Asia. Initially prescribed for neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy, stroke prophylaxis) and hypertension, modern research has expanded its therapeutic portfolio to include anti-aging, antitumor, and osteoprotective applications. This systematic review synthesizes 1) traditional ethnopharmacological uses, 2) phytochemical profiling of 100+ identified bioactive metabolites (e.g., gastrodin, parishins), and 3) mechanistic insights into their pharmacokinetic behaviors and pharmacodynamic actions. Notably, botanical drug interactions in TCM formulations enhance gastrodin’s blood-brain barrier penetration, elucidating clinical efficacy. While in vitro/vivo studies validate GE’s antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, translational challenges persist: 1) Limited clinical trials on novel indications (e.g., osteoporosis); 2) Unclear structure-activity relationships of minor metabolites; 3) Standardization needs for industrial applications. This work provides an evidence base to guide future research on GE’s diversified therapeutic development.","source":"bioinformatics_frontiers_pharmacology","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1641443","published_date":"2025-11-07T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-07T06:42:01.325356","language":"en","tags":["biocentre-core","pharmacology","phytochemistry","drug-discovery","review","plant-based-pharma","bioinformatics"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Frontiers

Offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences and subjective evaluation criteria in routing decisions. Today we are extending that approach to Claude Code via Arch Gateway[1], bringing multi-LLM access into a single CLI agent with two main benefits: Model Access: Use Claude Code alongside Grok, Mistral, Gemini, DeepSeek, GPT or local models via Ollama.

Most routers lean on performance metrics — public benchmarks like MMLU or MT-Bench, or raw latency/cost curves. The problem: they miss domain-specific quality, subjective evaluation criteria, and the nuance of what a “good” response actually means for a particular user. They can be opaque, hard to debug, and disconnected from real developer needs.

{"id":"arxiv_a5057ce872d6","title":"Can Online GenAI Discussion Serve as Bellwether for Labor Market Shifts?","content":"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has generated considerable speculation regarding their transformative potential for labor markets. However, existing approaches to measuring AI exposure in the workforce predominantly rely on concurrent market conditions, offering limited predictive capacity for anticipating future disruptions. This paper presents a predictive study examining whether online discussions about LLMs can function as early indicators of labor market shifts. We employ four distinct analytical approaches to identify the domains and timeframes in which public discourse serves as a leading signal for employment changes, thereby demonstrating its predictive validity for labor market dynamics. Drawing on a comprehensive dataset that integrates the REALM corpus of LLM discussions, LinkedIn job postings, Indeed employment indices, and over 4 million LinkedIn user profiles, we analyze the relationship between discussion intensity across news media and Reddit forums and subsequent variations in job posting volumes, occupational net change ratios, job tenure patterns, unemployment duration, and transitions to GenAI-related roles across thirteen occupational categories. Our findings reveal that discussion intensity predicts employment changes 1-7 months in advance across multiple indicators, including job postings, net hiring rates, tenure patterns, and unemployment duration. These findings suggest that monitoring online discourse can provide actionable intelligence for workers making reskilling decisions and organizations anticipating skill requirements, offering a real-time complement to traditional labor statistics in navigating technological disruption.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16028v1","published_date":"2025-11-20T04:18:25","collected_date":"2025-11-22T06:41:11.628887","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","cscy"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2511.16028v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16028v1.pdf","authors":["Shurui

{"id":"science_mdpi_electronics_fd28d39d92c7","title":"Electronics, Vol. 14, Pages 3849: A Comparative Study of BERT","content":"Assessing teaching behavior is essential for improving instructional quality, particularly in Physical Education, where classroom interactions are fast-paced and complex. Traditional evaluation methods such as questionnaires, expert observations, and manual discourse analysis are often limited by subjectivity, high labor costs, and poor scalability. These challenges underscore the need for automated, objective tools to support pedagogical assessment. This study explores and compares the use of Transformer-based language models for the automatic classification of teaching behaviors from real classroom transcriptions. A dataset of over 1300 utterances was compiled and annotated according to the teaching styles proposed in the circumplex approach (Autonomy Support, Structure, Control, and Chaos), along with an additional category for messages in which no style could be identified (Unidentified Style). To address class imbalance and enhance linguistic variability, data augmentation techniques were applied. Eight pretrained BERT-based Transformer architectures were evaluated, including several pretraining strategies and architectural structures. BETO achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.78, a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.72, and a weighted F1-score of 0.77. It showed strength in identifying challenging utterances labeled as Chaos and Autonomy Support. Furthermore, other BERT-based models purely trained with a Spanish text corpus like DistilBERT also present competitive performance, achieving accuracy metrics over 0.73 and and F1-score of 0.68. These results demonstrate the potential of leveraging Transformer-based models for objective and scalable teacher behavior classification. The findings support the feasibility of leveraging pretrained language models to develop scalable, AI-driven systems for classroom behavior classification and pedagogical feedback.","source":"science_mdpi_electronics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/14/19/3849","published_date":"2025-09-28T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-09-29T01:52:23.043341","language":"en","tags":["engineering","open-access","electronics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Electronics","source_category":"science","word_count":246,"author":"Evelia Franco Franco Álvarez","raw_content_length":1903,"priority":7,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.23,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Transformer","BERT Assessing","Physical Education"],"persons":["Autonomy Support","Vol"],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1903,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Electronics","Pages","A Comparative Study","BERT","behavior","instructional quality","Physical Education","classroom interactions","Traditional evaluation methods","questionnaires"],"filter_categories":{"research_academic":["A Comparative Study"],"ai_ml":["questionnaires"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Electronics":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"A Comparative Study":2.0,"BERT":2.0,"behavior":1.0,"instructional quality":1.0,"Physical Education":1.0,"classroom interactions":1.0,"Traditional evaluation methods":1.0,"questionnaires":1.0}},"age_hours":26.33201499638889,"is_recent":false,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.0115,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2023,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"heartwarming_score":0,"uplifting_score":0,"inspiring_score":0,"is_heartwarming":false,"is_uplifting":false,"is_inspiring":false,"emotion_method":"api"},"ai-engineering-practice_analysis":{"content_type":"practitioner_account","workflow_detail":{"score":7.0,"evidence":"The article describes a workflow where the author uses an AI tool to generate code, then reviews and modifies it.

Se trata de una suscripción inferior a la de Google AI Pro, que conserva cosas como el acceso a los modelos más avanzados de Gemini, pero recorta en el uso de otras herramientas adicionales. Este es un movimiento parecido al de ChatGPT Go, con el que Google intenta hacer más accesible la inteligencia artificial de pago. Porque las suscripciones de 20 euros son excesivas para la mayoría de usuarios, por lo que han decidido probar con una bastante inferior. Te diremos las características y la comparativa la otra suscripción. Qué es Google AI Plus Google AI Plus es el nombre de la suscripción más barata para usar Gemini de pago. Gemini es la inteligencia artificial de la empresa, y su versión gratuita está bastante limitada en cuanto al acceso a modelos más avanzados y potentes. La solución si quieres un mayor acceso a la IA más potente de Google es pagar, y esta es una suscripción que busca ser más asequible. Inicialmente Google creó dos suscripciones de pago. Para la gente \"de a pie\" ofrecía la AI Pro con un precio de 22 euros al mes, y para usuarios más avanzados otra de 275 euros al mes. Claramente, incluso la más \"barata\" era excesiva para la mayoría de los usuarios, por lo que decidieron crear un escalón más, una suscripción más económica. Pagando esta suscripción tendrás acceso a Gemini 3 Pro o los nuevos modelos que llegan en el futuro. El acceso no será algo más limitado que el de la suscripción más cara, pero más amplio que en la versión gratuita.

La versión más cara tiene límites de uso más amplios, pero la económica ya es una puerta de acceso interesante, también para crear vídeos a partir de imágenes. Una de las diferencias la vemos en la cantidad de créditos mensuales para Flow y Whisk, que es cinco veces superior en la suscripción más cara. También pasa lo mismo con NotebookLM, que tiene cinco veces más límites en la versión de Pro, pero en la Plus ya tienes acceso. También pasa lo mismo con la posibilidad de usar Gemini en las apps de Google, como Gmail o los documentos, en ambas suscripciones la tienes. La principal diferencia viene con tres herramientas adicionales. La suscripción más económica no incluye las ventajas adicionales al usar Gemini en tu altavoz inteligente, como pueden ser un mayor historial de eventos y funciones. Tampoco tienes acceso a las opciones especiales para crear código o agentes de programación. Para esto tendrás que ir a la suscripción Pro como mínimo. También hay diferencia en el almacenamiento que se le añade a tu cuenta de Google. En la versión Pro siguen siendo 2 TB, pero en la Plus ya tienes 200 GB, que son más que los 15 GB que te da Google gratis. En Xataka Cómo crear presentaciones en Gemini desde un documento usando un solo prompt Precio de Google AI Plus Google AI Plus tiene un precio de 7,99 euros al mes. Puede haber ocasiones en las que haya una promoción temporal, como dos meses a 3,99 euros y luego ya volver a la suscripción normal. Pero el precio completo son los ocho euros al mes.

{"id":"arxiv_f299f282bbc9","title":"KScaNN: Scalable Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search on Kunpeng","content":"Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a cornerstone algorithm for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and machine learning applications. While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this domain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a critical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port of existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial performance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel ANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN embodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware algorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific optimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques, including a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual calculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an ML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of search parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and 3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for the critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results demonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a new standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based solution. This work provides a definitive blueprint for achieving leadership-class performance for vector search on modern ARM architectures and

{"id":"community_social_dev_to_c56f029b0398","title":"LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?","content":"LightReasoner: How Tiny AI Tutors Boost Big Brain Power Ever wondered if a little helper could make a genius even smarter? Scientists discovered a clever trick: let a small language model point out the exact moments when a larger model gets stuck, then use those clues to sharpen the big model’s thinking. Imagine a junior chef tasting a dish and shouting “add a pinch of salt!” – that tiny tip can transform the whole recipe. In the new LightReasoner method, the “junior” AI watches the “master” solve puzzles, spots the critical steps, and creates bite‑size teaching examples. The master model then rehearses only those key moments, cutting training time by up to 90% and needing far fewer data samples. The result? A boost of up to 28% in math problem accuracy without any human‑written answers. This breakthrough shows that even modest AI can become a powerful coach, making the biggest models smarter and greener. Next time you chat with an AI, remember: behind the scenes, a tiny teacher might be polishing its answers just for you. 🌟 Read article comprehensive review in Paperium.net: LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning? 🤖 This analysis and review was primarily generated and structured by an AI .
