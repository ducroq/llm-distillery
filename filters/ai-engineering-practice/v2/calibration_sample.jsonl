The term 'vibe coding' hadn't been coined yet, but that's exactly what I was doing—letting AI generate code while I steered the conversation. It felt magical. Until it didn't. After a few weeks, I noticed patterns: code redundancy creeping in, intentions drifting from my original vision, and increasing rework as the AI forgot context between sessions."}

One key difference I have noticed is the upfront cost.

What I have realized is that agentic coding shifts my cognitive load from on-demand execution to more pre-planned execution."}
