However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\\mu$J/frame.

While TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper, we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time. We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models $y=\\sigma_*(\\langle \\beta, \\mathbf{x} \\rangle)$, where the feature vector $\\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector $\\beta$ and the link function $\\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to shifts in the link function.

{"id": "arxiv_092c5fadbf1d", "title": "PDE-Free Mass", "content": "We propose a machine learning framework based on the next-generation Equation-Free algorithm for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of mass-constrained complex systems with hidden states, whose dynamics can in principle be described by PDEs, but lack explicit models. In these cases, some variables, closures, and potentials governing the dynamics are generally not directly observable and therefore must be inferred from data. Here, we construct manifold-ROMs -- using delayed coordinates, thus exploiting the Takens'/Whitney's embedding theorems. In the first stage, we employ both linear (POD) and nonlinear manifold learning (Diffusion Maps, DMs) to extract low-dimensional latent representations of the complex spatio-temporal evolution. In the second step, we learn predictive manifold-informed ROMs to approximate the solution operator on the latent space. In the final step, the latent dynamics are lifted back to the original high-dimensional space by solving a pre-image problem. We prove that both POD and the particular $k$-nearest neighbors lifting operators preserve the mass, a crucial property in the context of many problems, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and crowd dynamics. Actually, the proposed framework reconstructs the solution operator of the unavailable mass-constrained PDE, bypassing the need to discover an explicit form of the PDE per se. We demonstrate our approach via the Hughes model, approximating the dynamics of individuals minimizing travel time while avoiding obstacles and high-density regions. We show that DMs-informed ROMs outperform the best POD-informed ROMs thus resulting in stable and accurate approximations of the solution operator both in the latent space and, via reconstruction, in the high-dimensional space, and can therefore be integrated reliably over long time horizons.", "source": "arxiv", "source_type": "api", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17657v2", "published_date":

{"id": "science_biorxiv_ebf332ebe6f8", "title": "Evaluation of computational tools for predicting CRISPR gRNA on", "content": "CRISPR technologies has become an integral part of plant biotechnology, synthetic biology and basic plant research, routinely used by researchers for targeted genome modifications. CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) undermines the highly programmable nature of CRISPR, enabling site-specific genome editing. However, different gRNA targets showed highly variable on-target effectiveness and poor gRNA design could amount to wasting valuable scientific resources. There has been broad development of computational and web-based tools for gRNA efficiency predictions but their performances in plant genome editing remains controversial or untested. Hence, in this study, we systematically evaluated over 20 accessible, web-based in silico gRNA on-target efficiency prediction tools using an experimental plant genome editing dataset. Excitingly, we identified multiple tools, mostly developed using machine learning, that were highly predictive of gRNA on-target genome editing efficiency in planta. The prediction scores assigned to gRNAs in the dataset by these tools were significantly correlated with the frequency of CRISPR-mediated InDels in plants. Furthermore, we evaluated efficiency prediction scores available on popular platforms such as CRISPOR and CRISPR-P which contain large numbers of non-model plant genomes.

We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence. Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by 24-49\\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12974", "published_date": "2025-10-16T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T06:40:33.627981", "language": "en", "tags": ["computer-science", "preprints", "research", "cscv", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 140, "author": "Tianyu Zhang, Suyuchen Wang, Chao Wang, Juan Rodriguez, Ahmed Masry, Xiangru Jian, Yoshua Bengio, Perouz Taslakian", "raw_content_length": 1086, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.7, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Scope: Selective Cross arXiv:2510.12974v1 Announce Type:", "SCOPE"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1085, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Scope", "arXiv251012974v1 Announce Type", "new Abstract", "Vision-language models", "VLMs", "multiple vision encoders", "them", "yields", "returns", "SCOPE"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Scope": 2.0, "arXiv251012974v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "Vision-language models": 1.0, "VLMs": 1.0, "multiple vision encoders": 1.0, "them": 1.0, "yields": 1.0, "returns": 1.0, "SCOPE": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7676555141666666, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.169, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.8338, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9343, "joy": 0.0119, "surprise": 0.0283, "sadness": 0.0066, "fear": 0.0024, "anger": 0.0082, "disgust": 0.0084}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 8, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 3, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "The article describes a new AI model (SCOPE) that improves efficiency in vision-language models by intelligently selecting the best encoder for each image-text pair.

{"id": "science_mdpi_sustainability_1eb0a5912dda", "title": "Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9154: The Transformation of West Bay Area, Doha’s Business Center, Through Transit", "content": "Urbanization has posed significant challenges to cities globally, including urban sprawl, traffic congestion, reduced livability, and poor walkability. In Doha, Qatar’s capital, these issues are particularly pronounced in the West Bay Central Business District (CBD). Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is widely recognized as a key strategy to advance sustainable urbanism and mitigate such challenges. This study employs the Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM) to systematically assess the urban design and spatial configuration of West Bay through observational analysis. The research aims to reassess the urban form and enhance transit integration through a multi-stage, iterative process, focusing on critical determinants such as compactness, complexity, and connectivity. The analysis is structured around five essential design dimensions: (i) walkability, (ii) ground-level land use balance, (iii) mixed-use and public spaces, (iv) inter-modality and transport hubs, and (v) the public transportation network. Findings reveal key urban design deficiencies, including limited intermodal connectivity, insufficient green open spaces, and a lack of diverse land use around the metro station. To address these gaps, the study proposes a set of context-sensitive policy and design guidelines to support TOD-based regeneration. This research contributes directly to SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and supports SDG 9 and SDG 13 through its emphasis on infrastructure integration and climate-responsive planning. The findings offer practical insights for urban planners, developers, and policymakers engaged in sustainable urban transformation.", "source": "science_mdpi_sustainability", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/20/9154", "published_date": "2025-10-16T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T01:52:25.157434", "language": "en", "tags": ["environment", "open-access", "sustainability", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Sustainability", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 222, "author": "Hatem Ibrahim", "raw_content_length": 1673, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.11, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["IMM", "Transit-Oriented Development", "TOD", "the Integrated Modification Methodology", "Doha’s Business Center"], "persons": [], "locations": ["Qatar", "West Bay", "Doha", "West Bay Central Business District"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1663, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Sustainability", "Pages", "The Transformation", "West Bay Area", "Dohas Business Center", "Transit", "Urbanization", "significant challenges", "cities", "urban sprawl"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Sustainability"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Sustainability": 2.0, "Pages": 2.0, "The Transformation": 2.0, "West Bay Area": 2.0, "Dohas Business Center": 2.0, "Transit": 2.0, "Urbanization": 1.0, "significant challenges": 1.0, "cities": 1.0, "urban sprawl": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.0036859408333334, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 3.75, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.25, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8742, "joy": 0.0045, "surprise": 0.0124, "sadness": 0.0204, "fear": 0.0333, "anger": 0.0181, "disgust": 0.0371}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "environmental|community_building", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 8, "connection": 5, "innovation": 6, "justice": 5, "resilience": 6, "wonder": 4, "reasoning": "Urban planners and policymakers are actively working to transform the West Bay area of Doha into a more sustainable and livable urban environment.

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_05f06d101d46", "title": "How AI is Changing the Future of Photo Editing", "content": "Introduction For years, photo editing has been dominated by professional tools like Photoshop. While these tools still hold their place, the rise of artificial intelligence in photo editing is changing the way we think about visuals. Tasks that once required hours of effort—removing backgrounds, retouching portraits, or enhancing colors—can now be done in seconds with AI. This shift isn’t just about speed; it’s about accessibility. AI tools are opening up editing to people who don’t have professional design skills, making high-quality visuals more achievable for businesses, marketers, and everyday creators. What AI Can Do in Photo Editing Today AI has already proven itself capable of handling a wide range of editing tasks. Some of the most common include: Background Removal – AI can instantly detect and isolate subjects, replacing backgrounds in a single click. Automatic Retouching – Skin smoothing, color correction, and exposure balancing can be handled automatically. Generative Fill – Missing areas of an image can be filled in realistically, making it possible to extend or repair photos. Style Transfer – Images can adopt the look of a painting, match a brand style, or follow a consistent filter across campaigns. These features were once exclusive to professionals. Now, they’re available to anyone with an internet connection. Why AI Matters for Businesses and Creators Speed and Efficiency Businesses that manage hundreds of product images can process them in bulk, saving time and resources. Lower Costs Small businesses and startups no longer need to invest heavily in professional studios for basic image edits. Accessibility for Non-Designers Marketers, entrepreneurs, and even individuals can produce professional-looking visuals without formal training. Creative Freedom With repetitive tasks automated, creators have more time to focus on innovation and storytelling. Limitations of AI Editing Despite its advantages, AI isn’t perfect. Some of the challenges include: Difficulty handling complex details like hair, glass, and reflections. A tendency to produce generic results when relying only on templates. Lack of human judgment in creative contexts, such as branding decisions or artistic direction. For projects where detail and creativity matter most—like magazine covers or branding campaigns—human editors and advanced tools remain essential. The Future of Photo Editing Image Credit- FreePixel The future will likely be hybrid, where AI handles routine tasks and humans focus on creativity. We’re already seeing this shift: Traditional tools like Photoshop are adding AI-powered features such as generative fill and smart masking. AI platforms are expanding into 3D visuals, AR previews, and campaign-ready templates. Businesses are adopting workflows where AI creates the first draft, and humans refine the final output. This convergence suggests that photo editing is no longer about choosing AI or Photoshop—it’s about using both in tandem. Conclusion AI is reshaping the world of photo editing. It brings speed, affordability, and accessibility, allowing anyone—from solo entrepreneurs to big companies—to create professional visuals. But it also has limits, especially when it comes to complex or creative projects. The best approach is not to see AI as a replacement, but as a partner: AI for efficiency and scale. Humans for creativity and detail. Together, they represent the future of modern image editing.", "source": "community_social_dev_to", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://dev.to/hassan_3bbb2ffd268a7bcf0b/how-ai-is-changing-the-future-of-photo-editing-5bc9", "published_date": "2025-10-03T06:26:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-03T06:40:53.522522", "language": "en", "tags": ["photoediting", "developer", "imageediting", "community", "tutorials", "trends", "design", "community_social"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "DEV Community", "source_category": "community_social", "word_count": 515, "author": "Hassan", "raw_content_length": 5085, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 12, "reading_time_minutes": 2.575, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Background Removal", "Automatic Retouching"], "persons": [], "locations": ["Photo"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 3454, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["the Future", "Photo Editing", "photo editing", "years", "professional tools", "Photoshop", "these tools", "their place", "the rise", "artificial intelligence"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["artificial intelligence"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"the Future": 2.0, "Photo Editing": 2.0, "photo editing": 2.0, "years": 1.0, "professional tools": 1.0, "Photoshop": 1.0, "these tools": 1.0, "their place": 1.0, "the rise": 1.0, "artificial intelligence": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 0.41625294861111106, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.404, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.6808, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "business_news", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 3, "resilience": 4, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "AI is enabling more people to create high-quality visuals, democratizing access to professional-level photo editing.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_0072000b482a", "title": "AOAD-MAT: Transformer", "content": "arXiv:2510.13343v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks.

While few-shot learning has been applied to particle picking and subtomogram classification in cryo-EM, its application to micrograph-level quality assessment remains largely unexplored. We present a framework combining few-shot learning with cryo-EM micrograph classification using triplet loss embeddings. By combining real-space and Fourier-space information in an embedding network trained with triplet loss, we achieve competitive performance across multiple EMPIAR datasets using as few as 1-5 labeled examples per class. Our approach demonstrates improvements over traditional cross-entropy training, which often collapses to predicting only the majority class in the few-shot regime.

To address these challenges, we propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines.

The clinical outcomes of these two groups differ significantly, yet the underlying reasons remain unclear, with limited studies addressing this issue. This study investigates the alterations in the pulmonary microbiota of HIV-positive and non-HIV patients following pneumocystis jirovecii infection.Collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with HIV and non HIV infected Pneumocystis jirovecii, and compare the differences in pulmonary microbiota between the two groups.In total, 77 patients with pulmonary infection that had next generation sequencing performed on their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and confirmed pneumocystis jirovecii infection were recruited in our study. Of the 77 patients with pneumocystis jirovecii infection, 52 were infected with HIV, and 25 were uninfected.Our findings indicate that HIV-positive patients exhibit a more diverse microbiota, predominantly characterized by viral co-infections. Specifically, 88.5% of HIV-positive patients experienced viral co-infections, primarily involving herpes viruses, followed by bacterial (61.5%) and fungal (40.4%) co-infections. In contrast, non-HIV patients predominantly exhibited bacterial co-infections (72%), followed by viral (52%) and fungal (36%) co-infections. By analyzing the next generation sequencing data of both groups, we identified statistically significant differences in viral infections (p < 0.001), while no significant differences were observed for bacterial or fungal infections. Furthermore, among the background bacteria detected via next generation sequencing in both patient groups, 22 microbial species were commonly present.

{"id": "healthcare_medrxiv_0a202c0faf6a", "title": "Childhood Maltreatment and Risk for Illicit Substance Use: Evidence for Mid", "content": "Background: Childhood maltreatment is a well-established risk factor for substance misuse. However, it remains unclear whether risk for specific illicit substances is driven primarily by the cumulative burden of adverse experiences or by exposures during specific sensitive developmental periods. Methods: We administered the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale to 2,013 medically healthy young adults (693M/1320F, ages 18-25) to assess severity of exposure to ten maltreatment types across each year of childhood. Lifetime non-medical use of opioids, stimulants, cocaine, sedatives, hallucinogens, and polysubstance involvement was determined using the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). We employed an integrative analytical approach, combining machine learning (random forests) with modern causal inference (Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation) and survival modeling. Findings: Although maltreatment multiplicity (number of types) was associated with substance use in initial models, it was not a significant predictor in analyses that included specific type-time exposures. Machine learning and causal inference instead identified peer emotional abuse at age 15 in males and childhood sexual abuse at age 15 in females as potent risk factors for multiple outcomes, including opioid, stimulant, and polysubstance use. These specific exposures increased absolute risk by 20-35% (Risk Ratios: 2- to 4-fold), with associations robust to unmeasured confounding (E-values: 4-10). The apparent population-level dose-response relationship for multiplicity is therefore likely explained by the higher concentration of these critical type-time exposures among individuals with high maltreatment multiplicity. Interpretation: Our findings challenge the cumulative burden model, providing robust evidence for mid-adolescence as a sensitive period during which specific maltreatment exposures, peer victimization in males and sexual abuse in females, causally shape trajectories of illicit substance misuse. Prevention strategies targeting these adversities and clinical screening during this developmental window may be crucial for reducing the population burden of substance use disorders.", "source": "healthcare_medrxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2025.10.10.25337769v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-13T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T18:36:35.438564", "language": "en", "tags": ["health", "clinical", "preprints", "medicine", "healthcare"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "medrxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "healthcare", "word_count": 294, "author": "Khan, A., Teicher, M.

A more recent phenomenon in the United States has been the creation of inauthentic local news websites to further an information operation campaign. This paper is a review of the 7 instances in which local news websites were created to influence residents of a region between 2007 and 2024. By breaking down the ways in which these sites operated, we discovered commonalities in the approach - resurrecting \"zombie\" papers that were previously established authentic local news organizations, sharing these sites on social media, and using website templates from WordPress.

We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00853", "published_date": "2025-10-13T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T06:41:50.020819", "language": "en", "tags": ["mathmp", "cond-matstr-el", "research", "preprints", "mathematics", "math-ph", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 149, "author": "Simone Fabbri, Alessandro Giuliani, Robin Reuvers", "raw_content_length": 1022, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 0.745, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Haldane", "Hall"], "persons": ["e^2", "Haldane", "Hall"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1021, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Universality", "the topological phase transition", "the interacting Haldane model", "arXiv250400853v3 Announce Type", "replace-cross Abstract", "The Haldane model", "a standard tight-binding model", "electrons", "a hexagonal lattice", "a transverse dipolar magnetic field"], "filter_categories": {"business_innovation": ["a transverse dipolar magnetic field"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Universality": 2.0, "the topological phase transition": 2.0, "the interacting Haldane model": 2.0, "arXiv250400853v3 Announce Type": 1.0, "replace-cross Abstract": 1.0, "The Haldane model": 1.0, "a standard tight-binding model": 1.0, "electrons": 1.0, "a hexagonal lattice": 1.0, "a transverse dipolar magnetic field": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7854974388888887, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.7115, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.5423, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8859, "joy": 0.0097, "surprise": 0.0574, "sadness": 0.0079, "fear": 0.0092, "anger": 0.0156, "disgust": 0.0142}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 8, "connection": 5, "innovation": 7, "justice": 0, "resilience": 0, "wonder": 7, "reasoning": "The research rigorously establishes a fundamental property of a physical system, proving the universality of a topological phase transition.

In this work, we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide benefits. We build a recipe called $\\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical design choices: (1) a ``lightweight'' warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful, harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box (e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful requests by reasoning per prompt.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "science_biorxiv_d580c0c836f0", "title": "Postnatal maternal care impacts hypothalamic Esrrg gene expression, co", "content": "Environmental exposures co-occurring during early life have a profound influence on neurodevelopment. Our previous work in rats suggests that postnatal maternal care modulates the effects of prenatal exposure to bisphenols, an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical, on offspring neurodevelopment. Elevated postnatal maternal licking/grooming and prenatal bisphenol exposure have known opposing effects on estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus, which could impact expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Opposing effects on DNA methylation of Esr1 have also been observed as a consequence of these exposures, with potentially broad transcriptional effects. Based on this previous work, we hypothesized that postnatal maternal licking/grooming would mitigate the effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure on Esr1 expression and estrogen-responsive genes in the developing MPOA. In addition, we hypothesized that there would be interactive effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure and postnatal maternal licking/grooming on DNA methylation, particularly nearby estrogen responsive elements. We administered either a bisphenol mixture (BPA, BPF, BPS), BPA only, or a corn oil control to pregnant rat dams. Postnatal maternal care was measured using home-cage videos. Brains from male and female pups were collected at postnatal day 10 and the transcriptome and DNA methylome were assessed in the MPOA. Our results indicated a significant interaction between prenatal bisphenol exposure and maternal postnatal licking/grooming on estrogen-related receptor gamma (Esrrg) expression, exclusively in female pups. These interactions were also evident in co-expression gene profiles in female pups; the majority of which were enriched for estrogen-responsive genes. Finally, DNA methylation analyses indicated that adding postnatal maternal licking/grooming as a covariate influenced the number of differentially methylated regions for prenatal bisphenol-exposed male and female pups. While these differentially methylated regions were not enriched for estrogen responsive elements, there were binding motifs for transcription factors that are known to interact with estrogen receptors, suggesting some secondary effects on postnatal gene regulation. These results suggest a novel biological mechanism in which postnatal maternal care can mitigate the negative neurodevelopmental impacts of prenatal bisphenol exposure.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.03.680379v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-04T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-05T06:37:26.216463", "language": "en", "tags": ["life-sciences", "cutting-edge", "biology", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 329, "author": "Lauby, S.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_e15be443388a", "title": "The whos, whats, and whys of issues related to personal data and data protection in open", "content": "arXiv:2304.06367v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US affect how software may handle the personal data of its users. Prior literature focused on how data protection regulations are discussed for software in operation, or how this topic is discussed in various channels outside of the software development process. Yet, what is missing, is a perspective on the impact of such regulations on the software development process. In our work, we address this gap, and explore how discussions during the development of software are impacted by regulations, who reports and discusses issues related to personal data and data protection, and how developers react to those issues. To that end, we used inductive coding to analyze 652 issues from Open Source GitHub projects and used the codes to quantitatively analyze the relation between the roles, resolutions, and data protection issues to understand correlations and predict resolutions of issues. Most notably we observed a significant increase in reporting when GDPR came into effect.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_3aa438df1da7", "title": "Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -", "content": "arXiv:2508.13785v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally to assess subsurface material types and drill quality, in order to significantly reduce downstream material handling costs. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, limited in its ability to capture the geometric and geological characteristics of holes. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - \"DIPPeR\". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust perception and navigation framework that provides streamlined blasthole seeking, tracking and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. To address challenges in the surface mining environment, where GPS and odometry data are noisy without RTK correction, we adopt a proximity-based adaptive navigation approach, enabling the vehicle to dynamically adjust its operations based on detected target availability and localisation accuracy. For perception, we process LiDAR data to extract the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above ground, then project the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image to form accurate 2D segmentation of hole regions. To ensure continuous target-tracking as the robot approaches the goal, our system automatically adjusts projection parameters to preserve consistent hole image appearance. At the vicinity of the hole, we apply least squares circle fitting with non-maximum candidate suppression to achieve accurate hole detection and collision-free down-hole sensor placement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field trials.

{"id": "healthcare_medrxiv_6751912aa435", "title": "Selective Removal of Endometriotic Lesions Using CUSA Clarity in Ovarian Endometriomas: A Case", "content": "Abstract Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of selective removal of endometriotic lesions using the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA Clarity) in ovarian endometriomas, with a focus on histological preservation of normal ovarian tissue. Methods: We analyzed tissue from a woman in her early 30s who underwent laparoscopic surgery for an ovarian endometrioma measuring approximately 7 cm after preoperative dienogest therapy. Resected cyst wall specimens were divided into five parts, each assigned to a Tissue Select setting (0-4). Samples were scraped with CUSA, followed by histological and immunohistochemical evaluation (H&E, Sirius Red, CK7, CD10). Results: Endometriotic lesions (epithelial and stromal cells) were effectively removed across all settings. At higher Tissue Select settings (3-4), preservation of surrounding tissue was superior, with minimal vacuolization compared to lower settings (0-2). Primordial follicles were observed approximately 600 um beneath the surface, highlighting the importance of limiting cavitation depth. Conclusion: CUSA Clarity enabled selective removal of endometriotic lesions with relative preservation of normal ovarian tissue, particularly at higher Tissue Select settings. This novel approach may represent a fertility-preserving alternative to cystectomy or laser ablation in the management of ovarian endometriomas. Further studies are warranted.

The multicoloured conjecture states, roughly, that a colouring $c$ of the points of $\\mathsf{PG}(n-1,q)$ containing no copy of a fixed colouring $c_0$ of $\\mathsf{PG}(k-1,q)$ for small $k$ must contain a subspace of dimension polynomial in $n$ that avoids some colour. If $(k,q) = (2,2)$, then $c_0$ is a colouring of a three-element 'triangle', and there are three essentially different cases, all of which we resolve. We derive both the cases where $c_0$ assigns the same colour to two different elements from a recent breakthrough result in additive combinatorics due to Kelley and Meka. We handle the case that $c_0$ is a 'rainbow' colouring by proving that rainbow-triangle-free colourings of projective geometries are exactly those that admit a certain decomposition into two-coloured pieces. This is closely analogous to a theorem of Gallai on rainbow-triangle-free coloured complete graphs.

{"id": "community_social_dev_to_00cf33ccbaa6", "title": "Psychological Effects of AI", "content": "This study examines the psychological effects of artificial intelligence use in educational settings on students' social behavior patterns. Focusing particularly on the increase in introversion tendencies, the research addresses the mechanisms explaining the psychological appeal of AI systems and the potential benefits and risks of these interactions. Conducted through literature review methodology, the study synthesizes current findings from self-determination theory, behavioral psychology, and social neuroscience. Results indicate that AI interactions support introverted behaviors by providing control, safety, and personalization, yet excessive use may lead to erosion in social skills, dependency, and diminished capacity for authentic relationship formation. Keywords: artificial intelligence, educational psychology, introversion, social behavior, artificial companionship, self-determination theory Technological developments have transformed human communication and social structures throughout history. Just as the printing press democratized access to knowledge, the telephone eliminated physical distances, and the internet connected billions of people, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are now reshaping how individuals relate to information and to each other (Turkle, 2011). AI systems, increasingly integrated into education, social life, and personal development, are leading to notable behavioral changes, particularly among younger generations. In recent years, while educational institutions have adopted pedagogical approaches centered on collaboration, teamwork, and group projects, a contrary tendency has been observed among some students: an increase in introversion and preference for solitary work. This paradoxical situation suggests that the intellectual partnership and emotional comfort provided by AI systems are becoming increasingly preferred over traditional peer relationships. However, the psychological mechanisms underlying this change and its long-term effects remain insufficiently understood.This study addresses the following fundamental question: Through which psychological mechanisms does interaction with AI systems strengthen introverted behavior patterns in students, and what potential benefits and risks does this change entail? The aim of the research is to examine the psychological dimensions of human-AI interaction from a balanced perspective and develop recommendations for educational policy. The study aims neither to demonize AI technologies nor to romanticize human sociability; rather, it seeks to present an evidence-based analysis of this phenomenon at the center of contemporary education and identity formation.This study employs systematic literature review methodology to synthesize current research in psychology, educational sciences, social neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. Relevant academic databases (PsycINFO, ERIC, Google Scholar) were searched to include empirical and theoretical studies published between 2010 and 2025.2. Theoretical Framework 2.1. Self-Determination Theory and Psychological Needs Deci and Ryan's (1985) self-determination theory posits that human motivation is built upon three fundamental psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Interaction with AI systems allows these needs to be met in different ways. The need for autonomy is satisfied through the user's ability to control the timing, content, and depth of interaction. The need for competence is supported through personalized feedback and adaptive learning experiences. Whether the need for relatedness can be satisfied by AI remains debatable. Baumeister and Leary (1995) emphasize that this need requires genuine reciprocity and emotional exchange. While simulated empathy offered by AI systems may superficially meet this need, it does not provide deep-level satisfaction. 2.2. Anthropomorphism and Social Perception Epley, Waytz, and Cacioppo (2007) explain humans' tendency to attribute human-like characteristics to non-human entities (anthropomorphism) through three factors: elicited agent knowledge, effectance motivation, and sociality motivation. AI chatbots trigger these three factors through language use and consistent response patterns, creating social perception in users. Nass and Moon's (2000) \"Computers Are Social Actors\" paradigm demonstrates that humans perceive computers as social actors and apply social norms toward them. These findings explain why AI interactions are psychologically rewarding. 2.3. Behavioral Psychology and Reinforcement Skinner's (1953) operant conditioning theory posits that behaviors are shaped by their consequences. The immediate feedback and consistent positive responses provided by AI systems create a reward system that reinforces user behavior. When each interaction results in a predictable and satisfying outcome, the user tends to repeat this behavior. 3. The Psychological Appeal of Artificial Intelligence: Six Core Mechanisms 3.1. Control, Safety, and Predictability Social interactions contain uncertainty and evaluation anxiety. According to Goffman's (1959) dramaturgical theory, individuals constantly perform in social settings and worry about the evaluation of that performance. For introverted individuals or those with high social anxiety, classroom environments can be cognitively and emotionally demanding (Cheek & Buss, 1981). AI interactions, however, offer a non-judgmental, controllable, and predictable environment. The user decides when to speak, how much to share, and when to stop. This sense of autonomy creates a space exempt from social comparison and performance pressure. 3.2. Simulated Empathy and Emotional Availability Modern AI systems can simulate empathy through natural language processing and sentiment analysis techniques. Although these responses are algorithmic and unconscious, they can create genuine emotional comfort in users (Bickmore & Picard, 2005). The anthropomorphism process leads users to interpret AI's consistent responsiveness as social feedback. Human peers may not provide the same level of accessibility due to divided attention, judgmental attitudes, or unavailability. For students experiencing social isolation or feeling misunderstood, AI's undivided attention becomes psychologically valuable. 3.3. Personalization and Cognitive Harmony In group learning, pace, depth, and method are determined collectively. While this supports collaboration, it may constrain individual preferences. AI systems, however, provide personalized experiences by adapting to learning styles, interests, and rhythms (Roll & Wylie, 2016). According to Csikszentmihalyi's (1990) flow theory, balance between an individual's skills and the challenge encountered creates optimal motivation. AI's adaptive structure facilitates this balance, increasing intrinsic motivation and reducing the cognitive friction often experienced in group work. 3.4. Asynchronous and Non-Physical Interaction Face-to-face communication involves complex cues such as tone, gesture, eye contact, and physical presence. For individuals sensitive to social cues or prone to overstimulation, this complexity can be exhausting (Aron & Aron, 1997). Text-based or screen-mediated AI interaction reduces this sensory load. Asynchronous communication allows individuals to think at their own pace, edit their responses, and withdraw without social consequences. This \"low-arousal social environment\" corresponds to the conditions preferred by introverted individuals (Little, 1983). 3.5. Emotion Regulation and Psychological Projection Individuals externalizing their thoughts, worries, or ideas in dialogue with AI functions as a form of expressive writing or cognitive offloading (Pennebaker, 1997). This process helps structure and reduce emotional chaos. Some students experience AI conversations as \"digital journaling that talks back.\" Over time, projection occurs: the individual begins to attribute understanding, empathy, or personality to the AI. This dynamic can be stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the user's awareness and emotional needs. 3.6. Positive Psychological Outcomes When used in moderation, AI companionship can yield tangible benefits. It can foster self-confidence, encourage expression, and provide safe rehearsal spaces for communication. Introverted students who prepare ideas with AI before group discussions may participate more actively afterward. Similarly, those struggling with language or learning barriers can use AI as an intermediary to articulate thoughts clearly (Holstein & Aleven, 2014). These outcomes suggest that AI can play a constructive role in emotional and cognitive development. When thoughtfully integrated, AI can serve as a psychological bridge between isolation and participation. 4. Risks and Consequences of Artificial Introversion 4.1. Erosion of Social and Emotional Skills Excessive reliance on AI interaction may erode fundamental social abilities. Real-world relationships demand negotiation, patience, empathy, and tolerance for ambiguity—skills that cannot be fully replicated in algorithmic exchanges. Students accustomed to predictable AI responses may find human communication irregularly frustrating. Social neuroscience research demonstrates that face-to-face interaction activates neural circuits related to empathy, emotional attunement, and nonverbal synchronization (Iacoboni & Dapretto, 2006). Without regular engagement in these activities, these circuits weaken. In educational terms, this could result in students who are intellectually competent but socially underdeveloped. 4.2. Dependence and Behavioral Conditioning AI systems provide immediate feedback and gratification. Every response, acknowledgment, or validation becomes a micro-reward that reinforces interaction. Over time, users may develop dependency patterns resembling behavioral addiction. The individual learns to seek reassurance, attention, or companionship from a source that never contradicts or disappoints. This phenomenon mirrors Skinner's principles of operant conditioning: behaviors followed by rewarding outcomes are more likely to be repeated. The predictability of AI companionship may strengthen a psychological loop that discourages engagement with less predictable, more demanding human relationships. 4.3. Pseudo-Empathy and the Illusion of Understanding AI's ability to generate emotionally resonant language creates what psychologists term pseudo-intimacy—a false sense of being truly understood (Turkle, 2015). When a student confides in a chatbot that responds with soothing words, it can feel like empathy, but no genuine emotional reciprocity exists. This illusion can delay or displace the pursuit of authentic relationships. The individual becomes emotionally self-contained, deriving comfort from simulation rather than connection. Over time, this may intensify feelings of loneliness, echoing the paradox found in excessive social media use: hyper-connectivity leading to isolation. 4.4. Cognitive Offloading and Decline in Critical Thinking AI's efficiency also brings cognitive risks. When students habitually rely on AI to summarize, explain, or generate ideas, they externalize essential cognitive processes. While this can enhance productivity, it weakens the mental muscles of analysis, synthesis, and independent reasoning. Cognitive psychologists describe this as offloading: transferring mental effort to external aids (Risko & Gilbert, 2016). The danger is subtle—students may continue to believe they are learning while actually consuming pre-processed reasoning. Over time, this fosters intellectual passivity and reduces resilience in dealing with uncertainty or complexity. 4.5. Algorithmic Bias and Narrow Cognitive Horizons AI systems reflect the data on which they are trained, inheriting cultural and linguistic biases. Students who engage exclusively with AI may unknowingly internalize these biases or adopt homogenized thinking patterns. The diversity of human experience—shaped by emotion, culture, and disagreement—cannot be fully represented in algorithmic models. Consequently, prolonged reliance on AI for companionship or learning may lead to epistemic narrowing: the belief that the most coherent or fluent answer is the most correct. This undermines the intellectual diversity that group work traditionally nurtures. 4.6. Emotional Detachment and Substitution of Authentic Intimacy Perhaps the deepest psychological risk is emotional detachment. Once individuals learn to fulfill emotional needs through non-reciprocal systems, they may find genuine intimacy burdensome. Authentic relationships require vulnerability, negotiation, and compromise—all absent in AI interactions. Clinical psychologists warn that this dynamic may produce relational desensitization: a diminished capacity to tolerate the unpredictability of human emotions. Students who grow accustomed to the steady, compliant tone of AI partners may struggle with real human disagreement, disappointment, or conflict. What begins as comfort thus evolves into avoidance. 4.7. Educational and Ethical Implications From an educational standpoint, excessive reliance on AI undermines the social function of schooling. Classrooms are not only sites of knowledge transmission but also laboratories for social learning. Collaboration teaches empathy, negotiation, and the management of diverse perspectives (Johnson & Johnson, 2009). When students prefer solitary engagement with AI tools, the collective dimension of learning erodes. Teachers may also lose their relational role, becoming facilitators of content rather than mentors of character. Ethically, educators must question whether the convenience of AI-assisted learning justifies the potential loss of interpersonal development. 5. Discussion: Rethinking Education and Human Connection 5.1. Balancing Solitude and Sociability Human development thrives on balance between solitude and sociability. Solitude is essential for reflection, creativity, and self-awareness; sociability builds empathy, resilience, and cooperation. When used wisely, AI can enhance the benefits of solitude by offering tools for introspection and self-guided learning. However, when it replaces social engagement, it distorts the equilibrium. Educational systems should therefore encourage structured solitude: deliberate moments of independent work complemented by collaborative reflection. For example, students might first use AI to generate ideas individually and then discuss them in groups, thus integrating private insight with public dialogue. 5.2. Teaching Emotional and Digital Literacy As AI becomes embedded in education, emotional literacy must evolve alongside digital literacy. Students should be taught not only how to use AI tools but also how to interpret their emotional effects. This includes recognizing pseudo-empathy, managing dependency, and distinguishing between authentic and simulated understanding. AI literacy courses should explore how algorithms generate responses, the limits of machine \"emotion,\" and the ethical responsibilities of users. By fostering critical awareness, educators can prevent students from conflating artificial responsiveness with genuine connection. 5.3. Redefining the Role of Teachers and Peers Teachers remain indispensable as facilitators of human connection. Their task is no longer to compete with AI in information delivery but to cultivate interpersonal intelligence—the capacity to communicate, empathize, and cooperate. Group work, long a staple of pedagogy, must be redesigned to accommodate the realities of the AI era. Smaller groups, clearer roles, and psychologically safe classroom environments can help introverted students participate without feeling overwhelmed. By reducing social dominance and promoting equitable dialogue, educators can make collaboration less threatening and more meaningful. ** 5.4. Ethical Frameworks for AI Use in Education ** Policymakers and institutions must develop ethical frameworks governing AI use in educational settings. These frameworks should address data privacy, emotional safety, and the potential psychological effects of long-term AI companionship. Transparency about how AI systems collect and use interaction data is crucial to maintaining trust and safeguarding mental health. Furthermore, guidelines should encourage human oversight and periodic disengagement from AI. Students should be reminded that digital empathy, while comforting, is not equivalent to human care. 5.5. Restoring the Meaning of \"Togetherness\" Ultimately, the challenge posed by AI is not technological but existential. It compels society to ask what it truly means to be together. If human connection becomes optional, mediated, or replaceable, education loses its moral and emotional core. The purpose of learning communities is not merely to exchange information but to cultivate the shared experience of being human—to confront difference, uncertainty, and mutual dependence. AI can assist in this process but must never define it. True learning involves friction, vulnerability, and dialogue—qualities that no algorithm can replicate. 6. Conclusion and Recommendations The growing introversion among students in the age of artificial intelligence is not simply a retreat from social life; it is a complex psychological adaptation to a changing environment. AI offers control, safety, and personalized engagement—powerful antidotes to the anxiety and unpredictability of human interaction. For many, it provides a space for self-expression, confidence building, and intellectual growth. Yet these same qualities harbor risks: dependency, social withdrawal, emotional detachment, and the gradual erosion of critical and relational skills. In light of these findings, the following recommendations are offered: Educational Policy: AI tools should be designed and integrated to enhance rather than replace human interaction. Pedagogical Approach: Hybrid models that balance structured solitude and collective learning should be developed. Digital Literacy: Students should be educated about the psychological effects, limitations, and ethical use of AI systems. Research Needs: Longitudinal empirical research on the long-term psychological and social effects of human-AI interaction should be conducted. Ethical Oversight: Data privacy protections and transparency requirements should be established in educational environments where AI is used. Teacher Training: Professional development programs should equip educators with strategies to facilitate meaningful human connection in the AI era. The task ahead is one of integration rather than rejection. AI represents neither salvation nor catastrophe, but a tool whose value depends entirely on how thoughtfully we choose to wield it. As we navigate this transition, we must remain committed to preserving what makes education fundamentally human: the messy, unpredictable, irreplaceable encounter between minds and hearts seeking understanding together.

This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy, exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters.

These conditions relax the traditional requirement of strong convexity-strong concavity, thereby encompassing a broader class of problems. We propose a generalized accelerated primal-dual (GAPD) algorithm to solve SP problems with non-bilinear objective functions, unifying and extending existing methods. We prove that our method achieves a linear convergence rate under these relaxed conditions. Additionally, we provide examples of structured SP problems that satisfy either two-sided QFG or QGG, demonstrating the practical applicability and relevance of our approach.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11990", "published_date": "2025-10-15T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-15T06:40:03.005962", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "mathoc", "mathematics", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 124, "author": "Cody Melcher, Afrooz Jalilzadeh, Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani", "raw_content_length": 960, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 0.62, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["QGG", "QFG"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 959, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Linear Convergence", "a Unified Primal", "Dual Algorithm", "Convex-", "arXiv251011990v1 Announce Type", "new Abstract", "this paper", "saddle point SP problems", "convex-concave optimization", "functions"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Dual Algorithm"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Linear Convergence": 2.0, "a Unified Primal": 2.0, "Dual Algorithm": 2.0, "Convex-": 2.0, "arXiv251011990v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "this paper": 1.0, "saddle point SP problems": 1.0, "convex-concave optimization": 1.0, "functions": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.758121138888889, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.55, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.91, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8382, "joy": 0.0378, "surprise": 0.0634, "sadness": 0.0107, "fear": 0.0103, "anger": 0.0284, "disgust": 0.0113}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 6, "progress": 6, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 7, "justice": 3, "resilience": 4, "wonder": 5, "reasoning": "The article describes the development of a new algorithm for solving saddle point problems, which has applications in convex-concave optimization.

We take a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2, a transformer genomic language model that uses byte-pair encoding to learn variable-length tokens from DNA. Using assays curated via the Johnston Cancer Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast, we assembled a balanced corpus of 2.34 million 1 kb enhancer sequences, applied summit-centered extraction and rigorous de-duplication including reverse-complement collapse, and split the data stratified by class. With a 4096-term vocabulary and a 232-token context chosen empirically, the DNABERT-2-117M classifier was trained with Optuna-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated on 350742 held-out sequences. The model reached PR-AUC 0.759, ROC-AUC 0.743, and best F1 0.704 at an optimized threshold (0.359), with recall 0.835 and precision 0.609. Against a CNN-based EnhancerNet trained on the same data, DNABERT-2 delivered stronger threshold-independent ranking and higher recall, although point accuracy was lower. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a second-generation genomic language model with BPE tokenization to enhancer classification in colorectal cancer, demonstrating the feasibility of capturing tumor-associated regulatory signals directly from DNA sequence alone. Overall, our results show that transformer-based genomic models can move beyond motif-level encodings toward holistic classification of regulatory elements, offering a novel path for cancer genomics. Next steps will focus on improving precision, exploring hybrid CNN-transformer designs, and validating across independent datasets to strengthen real-world utility.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25274", "published_date": "2025-10-01T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-01T06:39:42.400079", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "q-biogn", "preprints", "computer-science", "csai", "cslg", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 244, "author": "Darren King, Yaser Atlasi, Gholamreza Rafiee", "raw_content_length": 1820, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.22, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["the Johnston Cancer Research Centre"], "persons": ["F1 0.704", "Announce Type", "DNABERT"], "locations": ["ROC", "Belfast"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1819, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["DNABERT", "arXiv250925274v1 Announce Type", "cross", "Gene enhancers", "genes", "their sequence diversity", "specificity", "them", "colorectal cancer", "a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"DNABERT": 2.0, "arXiv250925274v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "cross": 1.0, "Gene enhancers": 1.0, "genes": 1.0, "their sequence diversity": 1.0, "specificity": 1.0, "them": 1.0, "colorectal cancer": 1.0, "a sequence-only route and fine-tune DNABERT-2": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7503168341666666, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 0.5964999999999998, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.8807, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "environmental", "agency": 6, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 3, "innovation": 8, "justice": 3, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "The study demonstrates progress in identifying gene enhancers related to colorectal cancer using a novel AI model.

The quadratic cost poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we introduce \\ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32 times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study, we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in the models' accuracy.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs",

Sanders, Don Operario, Elise M. van der Elst Background HIV partner notification services (PNS) have been proven safe and effective in finding undiagnosed HIV infections among general populations in settings with high HIV incidence, but have not been regularly implemented among men who have sex with men in sub-Saharan Africa. This study aimed to describe experiences with PNS in a cohort of newly diagnosed MSM in coastal Kenya, assess facilitators and barriers to participating in PNS, and explore which PNS strategies were preferred for different types of sexual partners. Methods The mixed-method study was conducted between January and July 2019 involving 27 MSM participants newly diagnosed with HIV who participated in PNS, of which 18 accepted to participate in a semi-structured in-depth interview which captured their perceptions, experiences, and views on PNS. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Results The median age of participants was 28 (interquartile range [IQR] 25–36) years old, and 44.4% completed primary school. The median number of named sexual partners in the previous 12 months was 3 (IQR 2–6; total partners 109). Facilitators to participation in PNS included reassurance of personal safety, support from peer-mobilizers, and a sense of responsibility to others’ well-being to prevent HIV transmission. Barriers to PNS participation included fear of stigma and discrimination as well as missing or incorrect partner contact information.

We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question.

We argue that superior finite-horizon performance requires \\emph{rapid convergence} to a \\emph{high-quality} policy. Thus motivated, we introduce a reformulation of online RBs as a \\emph{budgeted thresholding contextual bandit}, which simplifies the learning problem by encoding long-term state transitions into a scalar reward. We prove the first non-asymptotic optimality of an oracle policy for a simplified finite-horizon setting. We propose a practical learning policy under a heterogeneous-agent, multi-state setting, and show that it achieves a sublinear regret, achieving \\emph{faster convergence} than existing methods. This directly translates to higher cumulative reward, as empirically validated by significant gains over state-of-the-art algorithms in large-scale heterogeneous environments.

By combining circularly polarized attosecond pulses with broadband (``rainbow'') spectral analysis, we directly access two-photon ionization amplitudes and their relative phases. Time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger simulations, supported by Green's function theory, reveal strong resonances in helium and argon and a Cooper-like minimum in xenon. These results demonstrate that cuRABBITT provides continuous spectral mapping of bound-state resonances and extends Fano's propensity rule into the under-threshold regime.

We propose Drax, a discrete flow matching framework for ASR that enables efficient parallel decoding. To better align training with inference, we construct an audio-conditioned probability path that guides the model through trajectories resembling likely intermediate inference errors, rather than direct random noise to target transitions.

The classical Marstrand slicing theorem states that, for almost every $m$-dimensional subspace $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a positive-measure set of $x \\in V$ such that $x + V^\\perp$ intersects $A$ in a set of Hausdorff dimension $s-m$. We prove a strong and quantitative version of Marstrand's slicing theorem in the Peres-Schlag framework. In particular, if $(\\Pi_\\lambda: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}^m)_{\\lambda \\in U}$ is a family of generalized projections that satisfies the transversality and strong regularity conditions of degree $0$, then for every $A \\subseteq \\Omega$ with $\\mathcal{H}^s(A) > 0$, the set of $\\lambda$ in the parameter space $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^N$ such that $\\dim\\!\\big(A \\cap \\Pi_\\lambda^{-1}(x)\\big) < s-m$ for a.e. $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ has Hausdorff dimension at most $N + m - s$. If moreover $\\mathcal{H}^s(A) < \\infty$, then this exceptional set is universal for the subsets of $A$ with positive $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure in the sense that this same collection of parameters contains the corresponding exceptional sets of all those subsets of $A$. When $(\\Pi_\\lambda)_{\\lambda \\in U}$ is only transversal and strongly regular of some sufficiently small order $\\beta > 0$, a similar conclusion holds modulo an error term of order $\\beta^{1/3}$.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10844", "published_date": "2025-10-14T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T06:40:22.266138", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "mathca", "research", "mathematics", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 222, "author": "Ryan E.

{"id": "science_arxiv_physics_183b9eb10fec", "title": "Arbitrary Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Receiver via Scalable Rydberg Vapor Cell Array with Stark Comb", "content": "arXiv:2509.26026v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Rydberg atoms have great potential for microwave (MW) measurements due to their high sensitivity, broad carrier bandwidth, and traceability. However, the narrow instantaneous bandwidth of the MW receiver limits its applications. Improving the instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver is an ongoing challenge. Here, we report on the achievement of an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth MW receiver via a linear array of scalable Rydberg vapor cells with Stark comb, where the Stark comb consists of an MW frequency comb (MFC) and a position-dependent Stark field. In the presence of the Stark field, the resonance MW transition frequency between two Rydberg states is position dependent, so that we can make each MFC line act as a local oscillator (LO) field to resonantly couple one Rydberg cell. Thus, each cell receives part of a broadband MW signal within its instantaneous bandwidth using atomic heterodyne detection, achieving the measurements of the broadband MW signal simultaneously. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the MW receiver with 210~MHz instantaneous bandwidth using an MFC field with 21 lines. Meanwhile, we achieve an overall sensitivity of 326.6~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. In principle, the method allows for achieving an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver, provided we have enough MFC lines with enough power. Our work paves the way to design and develop a scalable MW receiver for applications in radar, communication, and spectrum monitoring.", "source": "science_arxiv_physics", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26026", "published_date": "2025-10-01T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-01T06:39:49.879723", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "physics", "physicsatom-ph", "preprints", "quant-ph", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "physics updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 227, "author": "Yuechun Jiao, Yuwen Yin, Yunhui He, Jinlian Hu, Cheng Lu, Jingxu Bai, Zhengyang Bai, Weibin Li, Suotang Jia, Jianming Zhao", "raw_content_length": 1546, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.135, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Rydberg", "MFC"], "persons": ["Stark Comb", "Stark"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1545, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Arbitrary Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Receiver", "Scalable Rydberg Vapor Cell Array", "Stark Comb", "arXiv250926026v1 Announce Type", "cross", "Rydberg atoms", "great potential", "microwave MW measurements", "their high sensitivity", "broad carrier"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Arbitrary Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Receiver": 2.0, "Scalable Rydberg Vapor Cell Array": 2.0, "Stark Comb": 2.0, "arXiv250926026v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "cross": 1.0, "Rydberg atoms": 1.0, "great potential": 1.0, "microwave MW measurements": 1.0, "their high sensitivity": 1.0, "broad carrier": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7593784799999996, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.01, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.802, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 3, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "Researchers have developed a new microwave receiver with an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth using Rydberg atoms.

Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07312", "published_date": "2025-10-16T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T12:55:42.423969", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "csai", "computer-science", "cslg", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 207, "author": "Sumeet Ramesh Motwani, Alesia Ivanova, Ziyang Cai, Philip Torr, Riashat Islam, Shital Shah, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Charles London", "raw_content_length": 1615, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.035, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Longer Horizons", "Reinforcement Learning arXiv:2510.07312v2"], "persons": ["Reason"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1614, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["LLMs", "Reason", "Longer Horizons", "Reinforcement Learning", "arXiv251007312v2", "Announce Type", "Abstract", "Large language models", "short-horizon reasoning tasks", "performance"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["LLMs", "Reinforcement Learning", "Large language models"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"LLMs": 2.0, "Reason": 2.0, "Longer Horizons": 2.0, "Reinforcement Learning": 2.0, "arXiv251007312v2": 1.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Large language models": 1.0, "short-horizon reasoning tasks": 1.0, "performance": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 9.038291445555554, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.5935, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.5187, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9013, "joy": 0.0072, "surprise": 0.0405, "sadness": 0.02, "fear": 0.0104, "anger": 0.0134, "disgust": 0.0072}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 8, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 3, "resilience": 6, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "Researchers are developing a more scalable method for LLMs to reason over longer horizons by composing simple problems into complex dependency chains and training models using outcome-only rewards.

{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_85ea1b06aff7", "title": "'Overleden paus nog aan het werk', AI", "content": "AI-chatbots geven nieuws geregeld verkeerd weer. Dat blijkt uit onderzoek van de BBC, het samenwerkingsverband van publieke omroepen EBU en 22 publieke omroepen, zowel in Europa als Canada en de Verenigde Staten. Zij zochten uit hoe betrouwbaar de resultaten van AI zijn. Ook de Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO) en de NOS werkten mee aan het onderzoek. In het onderzoek werden ruim 3.000 vragen, zogeheten prompts, gesteld aan vier AI-hulpen. Dat waren ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Copilot (Microsoft) en Perplexity. De antwoorden werden vervolgens door journalisten van de verschillende omroepen gecontroleerd op onder meer nauwkeurigheid en bronvermelding. Verkeerde bronnen Volgens EBU en BBC gebruiken mensen de AI-chatbots om een samenvatting van het nieuws te krijgen, maar gaat er bij 45 procent van de antwoorden iets mis. Zo geeft de chatbot vreemde bronnen voor zijn informatie aan en ook linkt de chatbot naar sites die niets met de vraag te maken hebben. Dat gebeurde onder andere bij de Vlaamse omroep VRT. Die vroeg aan Perplexity waarom de naam van de Golf van Mexico is veranderd in de Golf van Amerika. In het antwoord worden links aangehaald die niets met het onderwerp te maken hebben. Ook werden er in antwoorden citaten van sprekers toegeschreven aan een artikel of radiogesprek van een publieke omroep die niet in het originele materiaal van de omroep zaten. Dat gebeurde het meest bij de AI-hulp van Google, Gemini. Overleden paus Uit het onderzoek blijkt ook dat nauwkeurigheid en genoeg relevante context in de antwoorden een probleem is. Zo gaat het bij paus Franciscus mis. Deze paus overleed in april dit jaar. Het AI-onderzoek werd eind mei uitgevoerd. Drie van de chatbots geven aan dat Franciscus dan nog paus is. Microsoft's Copilot zet er nog wel bij dat hij al overleden is. De antwoorden waar informatie ontbreekt of waar foute elementen in staan, hebben volgens de publieke omroepen effect op hoe mensen kijken naar hun neutraliteit. Zo wordt er in een vraag aan ChatGPT over klimaatverandering een waardeoordeel gegeven. In het antwoord worden alleen NOS-bronnen getoond, wat bij de lezer tot de foutieve conclusie kan leiden dat de NOS een standpunt aanhangt. Alle antwoorden van de AI-hulpen zijn via de publieke, gratis versie van de chatbots verkregen. De Britse omroep BBC deed dit jaar al een zelfde soort onderzoek naar de betaalde versies. Ook toen werden veel fouten gevonden in de antwoorden, maar uit het nieuwe onderzoek blijkt wel dat er verbetering is. De EBU en de publieke omroepen roepen de Europese Unie op om het naleven van de wetten over AI beter te handhaven. Ook zou er volgens hen een waakhond moeten komen die regelmatig de AI-hulpen controleert.", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2587368",

To address this, we developed a two-stage robust charging infrastructure planning model for electrifying light-duty trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure, selected from multiple charger types and potential locations, and determines opportunity charging schedules for each truck based on the chosen infrastructure. Given the strict stopping points and schedules at industrial sites, we introduced a scheduling problem with abandonment, where trucks forgo charging if their waiting times exceed a maximum threshold. We also further incorporated the impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on waiting and abandonment behaviors. To represent the stochastic and heterogeneous parking durations of trucks, we constructed a decision-dependent robust uncertainty set in which parking time variability flexibly depends on charging choices. We applied the model in a case study of an open-pit mining site, which plans charger installations in eight zones and schedules a fleet of around 200 trucks. By decomposing the problem into monthly subproblems and using heuristic approaches, for the whole-year dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of less than 0.1 % within a reasonable computation time under diverse uncertainty scenarios.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13100", "published_date": "2025-10-16T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T06:40:33.653744", "language": "en", "tags": ["eesssy", "cssy", "research", "preprints", "computer-science", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 221, "author": "Yifu Ding, Ruicheng Ao, Pablo Duenas-Martinez, Thomas Magnanti", "raw_content_length": 1576, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.105, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1575, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Decision", "arXiv251013100v1", "new Abstract", "Many industrial sites", "diesel-powered light-duty trucks", "workers", "small-scale facilities", "which", "a significant amount", "greenhouse emissions"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Decision": 2.0, "arXiv251013100v1": 1.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "Many industrial sites": 1.0, "diesel-powered light-duty trucks": 1.0, "workers": 1.0, "small-scale facilities": 1.0, "which": 1.0, "a significant amount": 1.0, "greenhouse emissions": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7685330486111113, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 8.591999999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.7184, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9097, "joy": 0.0122, "surprise": 0.037, "sadness": 0.0059, "fear": 0.0065, "anger": 0.0213, "disgust": 0.0075}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "environmental", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 8, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 4, "resilience": 6, "wonder": 5, "reasoning": "The article describes a model developed to electrify light-duty trucks at industrial sites, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

{"id": "ai_engadget_54e34bb9b533", "title": "OpenAI will let adults use ChatGPT for erotica starting in December", "content": "OpenAI plans to open the floodgates to more adult uses of ChatGPT starting in December, according to a new post from CEO Sam Altman. The company announced that it would add parental controls and automatic age detection features in September, and it seems like a benefit of sorting out children from adults is an ability to offer more freedom in what ChatGPT can show users. \"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" Altman says. Some avid ChatGPT users already regularly manipulate the chatbot to engage in NSFW conversations, but Altman's announcement sounds more like tacit approval from OpenAI that those use-cases are okay. We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.Now that we have…— Sam Altman (@sama) October 14, 2025 The company signaled something similar during its DevDay 2025 announcements, when its new guidelines for developers creating apps for ChatGPT shared that \"support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place.\" After December, it sounds like adult interactions with ChatGPT or apps the chatbot can access are fair game. All of these changes are being made in the shadow of disturbing stories of the seemingly negative influence ChatGPT can have on users, including the death of 16-year old Adam Raine, who allegedly used ChatGPT to plan his own suicide. Reducing the chatbot's sycophantic qualities with the release of GPT-5 was one of the ways OpenAI tried to address the mental health impacts of ChatGPT, along with built-in notifications to remind users to take breaks. It's hard to definitively say whether these tweaks have made a difference, but combined with age-gating, it's clear OpenAI feels comfortable giving its chatbot a longer leash.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-adults-use-chatgpt-for-erotica-starting-in-december-182417583.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-will-let-adults-use-chatgpt-for-erotica-starting-in-december-182417583.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-10-14T18:24:25", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T18:40:33.808410", "language": "en", "tags": ["gadgets", "siteengadget", "languageen-us", "consumer", "technology", "headline", "regionus", "books_publishing"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 345, "author": "Ian Carlos Campbell", "raw_content_length": 3591, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.725, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["NSFW", "OpenAI"], "persons": ["Altman", "Sam Altman"], "locations": ["OpenAI"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2242, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["December", "OpenAI", "adults", "ChatGPT", "erotica", "the floodgates", "more adult uses", "a new post", "CEO Sam Altman", "The company"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["OpenAI", "ChatGPT"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"December": 4.0, "OpenAI": 3.0, "adults": 3.0, "ChatGPT": 3.0, "erotica": 2.0, "the floodgates": 1.0, "more adult uses": 1.0, "a new post": 1.0, "CEO Sam Altman": 1.0, "The company": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 0.3768569266666667, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 9.5305, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.9061, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9065, "joy": 0.0493, "surprise": 0.0278, "sadness": 0.0044, "fear": 0.0028, "anger": 0.0059, "disgust": 0.0033}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "business_news", "agency": 5, "progress": 5, "collective_benefit": 6, "connection": 3, "innovation": 4, "justice": 4, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 3, "reasoning": "OpenAI is implementing age-gating and parental controls to protect children from harmful content.

{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_5adea942d8ec", "title": "Grootschalig gokschandaal VS 'doet denken aan Hollywoodfilm'", "content": "Gemanipuleerde machines om speelkaarten te schudden, speciale lenzen en een röntgentafel om kaarten die op zijn kop liggen te kunnen bekijken: Francis Ford Coppola en Martin Scorsese zouden met gemak een filmscript kunnen schrijven naar aanleiding van een groot gokschandaal in de Verenigde Staten. Gisteren werden ruim dertig mensen in elf staten gearresteerd en aangeklaagd, onder wie leden van maffiafamilies en voormalige NBA-spelers. Het grote, meerjarige onderzoek en de aanhoudingen doen volgens de Amerikaanse politie \"denken aan een Hollywoodfilm\". De tientallen verdachten, tussen de 37 en 67 jaar oud, zouden pokerspelers in New York, Las Vegas, Miami en de Hamptons in opdracht van de maffia voor miljoenen dollars hebben opgelicht. Soms zouden ze wel tienduizenden of honderdduizenden dollars per keer hebben verloren. De nietsvermoedende spelers hadden niet door dat de pokertoernooien doorgestoken kaart waren. Deelname NBA-spelers moest slachtoffers overhalen De werkwijze van de tientallen verdachten die in opdracht van maffiafamilies opereerden doet geraffineerd en gewiekst aan. Bekende voormalige sporters zoals oud-NBA-spelers zaten in het complot om geen argwaan te wekken bij de slachtoffers. Zo zou onder meer de 49-jarige NBA-coach Chauncey Billups hebben meegewerkt aan de oplichtingspraktijken. Billups is sinds 2021 coach van de Portland Trail Blazers en speelde jarenlang voor de Detroit Pistons. Billups had een glansrol tijdens de gewonnen NBA-finale in 2004. Hij werd naderhand verkozen tot meest waardevolle speler in de finale en werd vorig jaar toegevoegd aan de Hall of Fame. Het Amerikaanse ministerie van Justitie heeft beelden vrijgegeven van de röntgentafel en kaartenschudmachine: Wat de slachtoffers niet wisten, was dat ze in de val waren gelokt en geen schijn van kans hadden om te winnen. De verdachten gebruikten onder meer gemanipuleerde schudmachines en speciaal ontworpen lenzen en zonnebrillen om de vooraf gemarkeerde speelkaarten te kunnen lezen. Ook was er een röntgentafel die kaarten kon lezen die met de afbeelding naar beneden lagen en waren er verborgen camera's bij de tafel en lampen. Verborgen technologie in de schudmachines maakte het mogelijk om alle kaarten te lezen en te voorspellen welke speler de beste kaarten in handen kreeg. Een van de verdachten die ergens anders zat, speelde deze informatie door aan een handlanger aan de speeltafel, die ook weer andere valsspelers op de hoogte bracht. De verdachten deinsden er volgens de aanklagers niet voor terug om slachtoffers die waren opgezadeld met gokschulden te mishandelen of af te persen. Een deel van het crimineel verdiende geld ging volgens de aanklagers naar de Amerikaanse maffiafamilies. Manipulatie basketbalwedstrijden Gisteren werden ook huidige en voormalige NBA-spelers aangehouden voor de manipulatie van basketbalwedstrijden. De verdachten zouden tussen december 2022 en maart vorig jaar blessures hebben geveinsd en insiderinformatie over opstellingen hebben gebruikt om weddenschappen te manipuleren. \"Dit was een geraffineerde samenzwering waarbij sporters, coaches en tussenpersonen betrokken waren die vertrouwelijke informatie misbruikten voor hun eigen gewin\", zegt aanklager Joseph Nocella. Zo zou NBA-basketballer Terry Rozier tegen zijn omgeving hebben verteld dat hij een basketbalwedstrijd vanwege een zogenaamde blessure voortijdig zou verlaten. De 31-jarige Rozier ging inderdaad na negen minuten van het veld, wat bij de weddenschappen tienduizenden dollars aan winst opleverde. Een vriend van Rozier reed volgens de aanklagers de hele nacht door naar het huis van de basketballer huis waar ze samen het geld van de weddenschappen telden. \"Het manipuleren van een professionele basketbalwedstrijd voor eigen gewin is even immoreel als illegaal\", zegt Jessica Tisch van de politie New York. \"Dat sommige spelers zich terugtrokken uit wedstrijden zodat mensen veel geld winnen met een weddenschap, is een belediging voor elke speler en fan.\"", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2587712", "published_date":

{"id": "science_arxiv_physics_16caf734faaa", "title": "Machine Learning approach to modeling of neutral particles transport in plasma", "content": "arXiv:2510.23088v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A propagator-based approach is investigated for Monte-Carlo (MC) modeling of neutral particles transport in fusion boundary plasmas. The propagator is essentially a Green function for the neutral kinetic equation, which depends on the plasma profiles. A Neural Network (NN) based model for the propagator provides a fast and accurate solution for the neutral distribution function in plasma. Furthermore, continuous and smooth dependence of NN-based reconstruction of the propagator on the plasma parameters opens the possibility for using this approach with Jacobian-based methods for time-integration and root finding. Initial results from a small 1D test problem look promising; however, important research questions are concerned with the scaling of the algorithm to larger systems.", "source": "science_arxiv_physics", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23088", "published_date": "2025-10-28T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-28T07:25:18.142625", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "physicsplasm-ph", "physics", "research", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "physics updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 117, "author": "M.

While prior work has established key type soundness results for reachability types using the usual syntactic techniques of progress and preservation, stronger metatheoretic properties have so far been unexplored. This paper presents an alternative semantic model of reachability types using logical relations, providing a framework in which we study key properties of interest: (1) semantic type soundness, including of not syntactically well-typed code fragments, (2) termination, especially in the presence of higher-order state, (3) effect safety, especially the absence of observable mutation, and, finally, (4) program equivalence, especially reordering of non-interfering expressions for parallelization or compiler optimization.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05885", "published_date": "2025-10-10T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-10T06:41:18.380771", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "cspl", "computer-science", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 144, "author": "Yuyan Bao, Songlin Jia, Guannan Wei, Oliver Bra\\v{c}evac, Tiark Rompf", "raw_content_length": 1082, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.72, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1081, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Modeling Reachability Types", "Logical Relations", "arXiv230905885v3", "Announce Type", "Abstract", "Reachability types", "a recent proposal", "Rust-style reasoning", "memory properties", "higher-level languages"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Modeling Reachability Types": 2.0, "Logical Relations": 2.0, "arXiv230905885v3": 1.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Reachability types": 1.0, "a recent proposal": 1.0, "Rust-style reasoning": 1.0, "memory properties": 1.0, "higher-level languages": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.7783829125, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 7.859499999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.5719, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.928, "joy": 0.0163, "surprise": 0.0379, "sadness": 0.0048, "fear": 0.0032, "anger": 0.0064, "disgust": 0.0034}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 0, "resilience": 0, "wonder": 7, "reasoning": "The paper presents a semantic model for reachability types, which aims to improve memory safety and program behavior in higher-level languages.

Different from other particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the conference version \\cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium. Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of log-likelihood and total iteration times.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04008", "published_date": "2025-10-02T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-02T06:39:32.628056", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "statml", "mathoc", "mathematics", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 242, "author": "Viktor Stein, Wuchen Li", "raw_content_length": 1745, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.21, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["SVGD", "Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow - arXiv:2509.04008v2", "SVGD (ASVGD"], "persons": ["Wasserstein", "Nesterov", "Stein"], "locations": ["Bayesian"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1744, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["SVGD", "Accelerated Stein", "Variational Gradient Flow", "Announce Type", "Abstract", "Stein variational gradient descent", "a kernel-based and non-parametric particle method", "a target distribution", "Bayesian inference", "other machine learning tasks"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["other machine learning tasks"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"SVGD": 3.0, "Accelerated Stein": 2.0, "Variational Gradient Flow": 2.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Stein variational gradient descent": 1.0, "a kernel-based and non-parametric particle method": 1.0, "a target distribution": 1.0, "Bayesian inference": 1.0, "other machine learning tasks": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.829286712777778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 5.0, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.0, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 3, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "Researchers are developing an accelerated version of Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), a method used for sampling from target distributions in machine learning.

The proposed data preparation and analysis methods automatically identify the system's topology and extract essential information, such as faulted paths, structures, loading of laterals and sublaterals, and estimate the fault location accordingly. The proposed graph analysis methods do not require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following changes in the system topology.

Existing XR-based systems enable efficient data collection but are often challenging to reproduce and reuse due to their specificity to particular robots, objects, simulators, and environments. IRIS addresses these issues by supporting immersive interaction and data collection across diverse simulators and real-world scenarios. It visualizes arbitrary rigid and deformable objects, robots from simulation, and integrates real-time sensor-generated point clouds for real-world applications. Additionally, IRIS enhances collaborative capabilities by enabling multiple users to simultaneously interact within the same virtual scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS offers efficient and intuitive data collection in both simulated and real-world settings.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url":

{"id": "economics_nber_working_papers_e6e358ffe4eb", "title": "Climate Change, Conflict, and the Risk of Economic Collapse in Africa -", "content": "Is human-caused climate change likely to trigger enduring economic decline in modern societies? We study whether changes in violent conflict and economic growth caused by warming could interact to degrade economic opportunities and trap African countries in poverty. We provide evidence of an emerging high-conflict and low-growth \"poverty trap\" equilibrium in Africa and describe theoretically how such an equilibrium could result from warming. We then combine historical data on temperature, growth, and conflict with projections from a large ensemble of global climate models to evaluate the risk that warming and subsequent conflict could push African economies into a regime of sustained negative economic growth. We find that the risk of such \"economic collapse\" is material in a moderate-to-high emissions scenario. We estimate that in Africa, a current \"high\" emissions trajectory (RCP 7.0) may increase the incidence of conflict 5.1 percentage points (95% CI 0.2-13.0) and increase the share of countries with net negative GDP growth this century by 12.2 percentage points (95% CI 2.0-27.5). We calculate that roughly 82% of this additional conflict risk and 14% of projected GDP losses are due to the interacting effects between these two outcomes, underscoring the importance of accounting for their indirect effects and feedbacks. Our findings suggest an unprecedented scale of emissions mitigation, economic policy innovation or institutional investment that would be required to contain the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change in many African countries.", "source": "economics_nber_working_papers", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34320#fromrss", "published_date": "2025-10-06T04:40:22.297119", "collected_date": "2025-10-06T06:40:22.297155", "language": "en", "tags": ["economics", "working-papers", "research"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "National Bureau of Economic Research Working Papers", "source_category": "economics", "word_count": 235, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 1587, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.175, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["the Risk of Economic Collapse"], "persons": [], "locations": ["Africa"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1586, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Africa", "Climate Change", "Conflict", "the Risk", "Economic Collapse", "human-caused climate change", "enduring economic decline", "modern societies", "changes", "violent conflict"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Africa": 3.0, "Climate Change": 2.0, "Conflict": 2.0, "the Risk": 2.0, "Economic Collapse": 2.0, "human-caused climate change": 1.0, "enduring economic decline": 1.0, "modern societies": 1.0, "changes": 1.0, "violent conflict": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.0794792047222224, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 0.17849999999999977, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.9643, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.2822, "joy": 0.0055, "surprise": 0.0093, "sadness": 0.0155, "fear": 0.4537, "anger": 0.1884, "disgust": 0.0453}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "environmental", "agency": 3, "progress": 3, "collective_benefit": 6, "connection": 0, "innovation": 3, "justice": 0, "resilience": 3, "wonder": 0, "reasoning": "The article highlights the potential for economic policy innovation and institutional investment to mitigate the risk of catastrophic human impacts from climate change.

In particular, in our pathophysiology-based framework, we consider both 0D cardiocirculatory models and a 3D-0D electromechanical model. The 0D model, which consists of an RLC circuit, is studied in two variants, with and without capillaries. The 3D-0D model consists of a three-dimensional electromechanical model of the left ventricle, coupled with a 0D model for the external blood circulation: this representation enables the assessment of additional quantities related to ventricular deformation and stress, and offers a more detailed representation compared to a fully 0D model. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the 0D model, with both a mono- and a multi-parametric approach, in order to identify the parameters that most influence the model outputs and guide the calibration process. We studied three different scenarios, corresponding to systemic, pulmonary and renovascular hypertension, each in three nuances of severity. To maintain a fair comparison among the models, a parameter calibration strategy is developed; the outputs of the 0D model with capillaries are utilized to enhance the 3D-0D model. The results demonstrate that the 3D-0D model yields an accurate representation of cardiocirculatory dynamics in the presence of hypertension; this model represents a powerful step toward digital twins for real-time hypertension control, providing refined and clinically meaningful insights beyond those achievable with 0D models alone.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url":

This study aims to develop and validate two novel stride length model-based approaches for total distance estimation using a smart insole. Eight participants wore a pair of smart insoles. For a period of six minutes, each participant walked back and forth on a predefined 20 m pathway, and the numbers of round trips and strides taken were counted. Two stride length estimation approaches based on the director coefficients of acceleration data (Approach 1) and dynamic time warping (Approach 2) using smart insoles were used. The median accuracies of the total distance using Approach 1 are 98.92% [1.24%] (ICC = 0.992) and 98.69% [2.44%] (ICC = 0.994) for the right and left sides, respectively. For Approach 2, the average accuracies are 98.95% [0.18%] (ICC = 0.996) for the right side and 99.03% [0.14%] (ICC = 0.991) for the left side. The Mann–Whitney U test shows no statistically significant difference between the actual distance and smart insole for the total distance covered. Furthermore, there is no statistically significant difference between Approach 1 and Approach 2 for stride length.

{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_daae2bc12049", "title": "Wolvenroedel houdt huis in Drents natuurgebied: in twee jaar tientallen kalfjes dood", "content": "In twee jaar tijd zijn tientallen kalfjes in het Drentse natuurgebied Elperstroom gedood door een wolvenroedel. Ook 25 volwassen koeien werden aangevallen. Voor Henny Lensing, de eigenaar van de kudde die het gebied van 600 hectare begraast, is de maat vol. \"Ik krijg er buikpijn van.\" Al 25 jaar laat Lensing zo'n 120 koeien Elperstroom begrazen, een natuurgebied van zo'n 600 hectare in de omgeving van Schoonloo. Toen de wolf in 2022 zijn intrede deed in het gebied, was de verwachting nog dat de kudde zich zou aanpassen aan de komst van de wolf. Maar al snel bleek dat de koeien zich minder goed konden verweren dan verwacht. Sinds vorig jaar heeft geen enkel kalf het overleefd. In 2024 waren er veertig kalfjes geboren, dit jaar vijftien. \"Als er af en toe wat gepakt wordt, oké. Maar dat echt al die kalfjes weg zijn, raakt me heel erg\", zegt ze tegen RTV Drenthe. Gevolgen voor natuur Daarnaast zijn er de afgelopen twee jaar ook 25 volwassen koeien door de wolvenroedel aangevallen. Vijf daarvan overleefden het niet. Omdat er op dit moment niets aan gedaan kan worden, brengt Lensing de kudde nu langzaam terug. Boswachter Linde Veldhoen van Staatsbosbeheer begrijpt die keuze, maar het weghalen van de runderen heeft wel gevolgen voor het natuurgebied Elperstroom, zegt ze. \"Op het moment dat je geen begrazing meer hebt in een gebied als dit, wordt alles bos. Dan mis je die variatie van de natuur, waar ook weer bepaalde dieren en planten, ook zeldzame planten, van afhankelijk zijn\", legt ze uit. Onderzoek naar gedrag Een oplossing is er nog niet. Staatsbosbeheer wil nu eerst inzicht krijgen in het gedrag van de runderen als er een wolf in de buurt is. Daarom hebben twee koeien een zender om en worden er wildcamera's gebruikt om het gedrag te onderzoeken. Willen de runderen toekomst hebben in natuurgebied Elperstroom, dan moeten de dieren leren dat ze een hechte en sociale kudde moeten vormen op het moment dat een wolf de aanval inzet, aldus Veldhoen. Zo kunnen ze hun kalfjes beter verdedigen. \"We zien gelukkig al een gedragsverandering, maar dat heeft meer tijd nodig.\" Het onderzoek duurt in totaal twee jaar.", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2584698", "published_date": "2025-09-30T19:35:12", "collected_date": "2025-10-01T01:57:25.564328", "language": "nl", "tags": ["nederland", "mainstream", "dutch_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "NOS Nieuws", "source_category": "dutch_news", "word_count": 362, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 2464, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.81, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["RTV"], "persons": ["Henny Lensing"], "locations": ["Schoonloo", "Drents", "Drenthe"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2137, "language_detected": "nl", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["jaar", "tientallen", "kalfjes", "Wolvenroedel", "huis", "Drents natuurgebied", "koeien", "het gebied", "tijd", "het Drentse natuurgebied"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"jaar": 3.0, "tientallen": 3.0, "kalfjes": 3.0, "Wolvenroedel": 2.0, "huis": 2.0, "Drents natuurgebied": 2.0, "koeien": 2.0, "het gebied": 2.0, "tijd": 1.0, "het Drentse natuurgebied": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 6.4704907205555555, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 2.0029999999999997, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.5994, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "environmental", "agency": 6, "progress": 5, "collective_benefit": 6, "connection": 4, "innovation": 5, "justice": 3, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 4, "reasoning": "Staatsbosbeheer is conducting research to understand the behavior of the cattle in the presence of wolves to help them adapt and form a stronger defense, aiming to preserve the natural grazing in the area and maintain biodiversity.

{"id": "arxiv_6067bbf30371", "title": "Better Tokens for Better 3D: Advancing Vision", "content": "Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

Existing assessments often rely on qualitative descriptions or composite indices, which can mask crucial differences between key domains such as mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk management, and loss and damage. To bridge this gap, we develop a quantitative indicator of climate policy orientation by applying a multilingual transformer-based language model to official national policy documents, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.90 (F1-score). Linking these indicators with World Bank development data in panel regressions reveals that mitigation policies are associated with higher GDP and GNI; disaster risk management correlates with greater GNI and debt but reduced foreign direct investment; adaptation and loss and damage show limited measurable effects. This integrated NLP-econometric framework enables comparable, theme-specific analysis of climate governance, offering a scalable method to monitor progress, evaluate trade-offs, and align policy

This study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed, and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust performance.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09093", "published_date": "2025-10-21T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-21T06:11:08.184299", "language": "en", "tags": ["research", "csro", "computer-science", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 184, "author": "Nan Mao, Junpeng Chen, Guanglu Jia, Emmanouil Spyrakos-Papastavridis, Jian S.

Despite its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric. Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency. Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs",

Special methods are needed to evaluate the integral accurately at points on or near the surface. Here we derive formulas to regularize the integrals with high accuracy, using analysis from Beale and Tlupova (Adv. Comput. Math., 2024), so that a standard quadrature can be used without special care near the singularity. We treat single or double layer integrals for harmonic functions or for Stokes flow. The nearly singular case, evaluation at points close to the surface, can be needed when surfaces are close to each other, or to find values at grid points near a surface. We derive formulas for regularized kernels with error $O(\\delta^p)$ where $\\delta$ is the smoothing radius and $p = 3$, $5$, $7$. With spacing $h$ in the quadrature, we choose $\\delta = \\kappa h^q$ with $q<1$ so that the discretization error is controlled as $h \\to 0$. We see the predicted order of convergence $O(h^{pq})$ in various examples. Values at all grid points can be obtained from those near the surface in an efficient manner suggested in A. Mayo (SIAM J. Statist. Comput., 1985). With this technique we obtain high order accurate grid values for a harmonic function determined by interfacial conditions and for the pressure and velocity in Stokes flow around a translating spheroid.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13639", "published_date": "2025-10-16T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T06:40:33.765729", "language": "en", "tags": ["csna", "research", "mathna", "computer-science", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 236, "author": "J.

Its virtues lie in protection against partial nuisance misspecification and asymptotic semiparametric efficiency under correct nuisance specification. However, in many applications, complete nuisance misspecification should be regarded as the norm (or at the very least the expected default), and thus doubly robust estimators may behave fragilely. In fact, it has been amply verified empirically that these estimators can perform poorly when all nuisance functions are misspecified. Here, we first characterize this phenomenon of double fragility, and then propose a solution based on adaptive correction clipping (ACC). We argue that our ACC proposal is safe, in that it inherits the favorable properties of doubly robust estimators under correct nuisance specification, but its error is guaranteed to be bounded by a convex combination of the individual nuisance model errors, which prevents the instability caused by the compounding product of errors of doubly robust estimators. We also show that our proposal provides valid inference through the parametric bootstrap when nuisances are well-specified. We showcase the efficacy of our ACC estimator both through extensive simulations and by applying it to the analysis of Alzheimer's disease proteomics data.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22446", "published_date": "2025-09-29T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-09-29T06:41:56.611021", "language": "en", "tags": ["mathematics", "research", "statme", "preprints", "statth", "statml", "mathst", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 201, "author": "Lorenzo Testa, Francesca Chiaromonte, Kathryn Roeder", "raw_content_length": 1405, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.005, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["ACC"], "persons": ["arXiv:2509.22446v1 Announce Type:"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1404, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["double robustness", "complete misspecification", "arXiv250922446v1 Announce Type", "cross", "Double robustness", "a major selling point", "semiparametric and missing data methodology", "Its virtues", "protection", "partial nuisance misspecification"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"double robustness": 2.0, "complete misspecification": 2.0, "arXiv250922446v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "cross": 1.0, "Double robustness": 1.0, "a major selling point": 1.0, "semiparametric and missing data methodology": 1.0, "Its virtues": 1.0, "protection": 1.0, "partial nuisance misspecification": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.9170113280555556, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.453999999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.6908, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 7, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 0, "resilience": 6, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "Researchers are developing a more robust statistical method (ACC) to analyze data, making it safer and more reliable, particularly in situations where existing models are flawed.

Event extraction uses the same ICL strategy with GPT-4.1, reusing the guideline summary in the prompt.

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_10b4ff402ac4", "title": "Column Generation Using Domain", "content": "arXiv:2510.14317v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming formulations for seven problem classes.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14317", "published_date": "2025-10-17T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-17T06:39:06.640261", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "research", "computer-science", "mathoc", "csai", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 149, "author": "Ryo Kuroiwa, Edward Lam", "raw_content_length": 1079, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.745, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1078, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Column Generation", "Domain", "arXiv251014317v1 Announce Type", "cross", "Abstract", "Column generation", "branch", "-price", "leading methods", "large-scale exact optimization"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Domain"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Column Generation": 2.0, "Domain": 2.0, "arXiv251014317v1 Announce Type": 1.0, "cross": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Column generation": 1.0, "branch": 1.0, "-price": 1.0, "leading methods": 1.0, "large-scale exact optimization": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.739980342222222, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 3.6914999999999996, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.2617, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9311, "joy": 0.0173, "surprise": 0.03, "sadness": 0.0066, "fear": 0.0051, "anger": 0.0062, "disgust": 0.0037}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "solutions_story", "agency": 7, "progress": 7, "collective_benefit": 8, "connection": 5, "innovation": 8, "justice": 0, "resilience": 0, "wonder": 6, "reasoning": "Researchers are developing a generic pricing solver using domain-independent dynamic programming for column generation, a method for large-scale optimization.

{"id": "arxiv_64f0d6947526", "title": "Optimizing Feature Ordering in Radar Charts for Multi", "content": "Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness'' across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial (exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity, practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement.

Due to the complexity of new problems related to the size of datasets, efficient approaches are obligatory. In optimization theory, the Heavy Ball and Nesterov methods use \\textit{momentum} in their updates of model weights. On the other hand, the minimization problems considered may be poorly conditioned, which affects the applicability and effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques. One solution to this issue is \\textit{preconditioning}, which has already been investigated in approaches such as \\textsc{AdaGrad}, \\textsc{RMSProp}, \\textsc{Adam} and others. Despite this, momentum acceleration and preconditioning have not been fully explored together. Therefore, we propose the Preconditioned Heavy Ball (\\textsc{PHB}) and Preconditioned Nesterov method (\\textsc{PN}) with theoretical guarantees of convergence under \\textit{unified} assumption on the scaling matrix.

However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \\textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as hair strands.

{"id": "science_arxiv_math_25bfdeef968a", "title": "Predicting the size ranking of minimal primes in the generalised Goldbach partitions", "content": "arXiv:2510.21870v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A scarcely known generalization of Goldbach's conjecture introduced by Hardy and Littlewood states that for every pair of (relatively prime) positive integers m1 and m2, every sufficiently large integer n satisfying certain simple congruence criteria can be $(m_1,m_2)$-partitioned as $n = m_1p+m_2q$ for some primes $p$ and $q$. While the size of the minimal prime in the Goldbach partitions of even numbers has received prior attention, we extend this investigation to the general case of $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions. This question has a direct implication on the running times of verification algorithms of the generalised Goldbach conjecture. We study the rankings of the pairs $(m_1,m_2)$ according to the sizes of the averages and maxima, respectively, of the minimal $p$ in the $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of numbers up to large thresholds, and propose a rank-order predicting function depending only on m2 and the prime factors of $m_1$. We computed both the average and the maximum of the minimal prime $p$ in all $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of integers up to $10^9$, for every pair of relatively prime coefficients $1\\leq m1\\neq m2\\leq 40$. Our function shows very high rank-order correlations with both the empirical averages and maxima of the minimal primes $p$ (Spearman's $\\rho=0.9949$ and $0.9958$, respectively). It also correctly predicts trends in the experimental data, for example, that for all relatively prime $1\\leq m1<m2\\leq 40$, the average minimal $p$ in the $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of numbers up to $10^9$ exceeds the analogous average for the $(m_2,m_1)$-partitions. We present numerical data, including the average and the maximum of the minimal $p$ in the $(m_1,m_2)$-partitions of numbers up to $10^9$ for each pair $1\\leq m1\\neq m2\\leq 20$ relatively prime, and the resulting size rankings.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21870", "published_date": "2025-10-28T04:00:00", "collected_date":

The non-vanishing of such an index locates the precise direction at infinity of the obstructions to positive scalar curvature, and may be viewed as a refinement of the positive scalar curvature problem. To achieve this, we formulate the relative coarse Baum-Connes conjecture and the relative coarse Novikov conjecture, together with their maximal versions, for general metric spaces as a program to compute the $K$-theory of the quotients of the Roe algebras relative to specific ideals. We show that if the metric space admits a relative fibred coarse embedding into Hilbert space or an $\\ell^p$-space, certain cases of these conjectures can be verified, which yield obstructions to the existence of uniformly positive scalar curvature metrics in specified directions at infinity.

{"id": "science_arxiv_physics_799ced9992af", "title": "Ultrasonic Medical Tissue Imaging Using Probabilistic Inversion: Leveraging Variational Inference for Speed Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification", "content": "arXiv:2501.07348v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a promising technique for achieving high-resolution imaging in medical ultrasound. However, conventional FWI methods suffer from issues related to computational efficiency, dependence on initial models, and the inability to quantify uncertainty. This study aims to enhance inversion performance and provide a reliable method for uncertainty quantification in medical FWI imaging. This study integrates the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm into the FWI framework by deriving the posterior gradient for probabilistic inversion. To evaluate the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets, including a breast tissue model with realistic anatomical structure. Imaging accuracy and uncertainty quantification are assessed to compare the performance of SVGD-based FWI with conventional FWI and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) methods. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is implemented as a benchmark to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates. For synthetic data, the SVGD-based FWI framework yields more precise estimates in the region of interest (ROI) and demonstrates faster convergence compared to the conventional FWI. For the anatomically realistic breast tissue simulation, SVGD produces a maximum relative error of 1.10\\% and a mean relative error of 0.09\\% in the ROI. The estimated uncertainty is spatially consistent, with most values below 0.01 and a mean of approximately 0.003.

To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash, especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%). Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

However, the generation of high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequencies remains a challenge for existing techniques. Here, a technique by combining the multi-laser pulses frequency beating and coherent undulator amplification is proposed for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable frequency. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed technique can produce multi-color THz radiation with three to six distinguished colors and a peak power up to hundreds of MW, and the temporally separated two-color pulses can also be produced by employing undulators with different resonance. Due to the intrinsic properties of the proposed technique, the THz frequencies, the color number and the frequency interval can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the beating laser.

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_92a45971aab6", "title": "China’s manufacturing activity shrank for the 6th straight month. Here’s why", "content": "China’s factory activity shrank for a sixth straight month in September, the longest slump since 2019, an official report said Tuesday.The official manufacturing purchasing managers index, or PMI, improved to 49.8 from 49.4 in August. But it remained below the 50-cutoff level between contraction and expansion on a scale of 0 to 100.A private sector PMI survey by the credit research and rating startup RatingDog was more upbeat, with September’s overall PMI rising to 51.2 from 50.5 in August.The mixed manufacturing measures reflect persisting sluggish domestic demand and uncertainties over trade tensions with the United States.More detailed data measuring new orders and production saw month-on-month improvements.“The September PMI reads from China offered a picture that looked less like a coherent growth engine and more like a car with one cylinder firing while another misfires,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentaryCompanies are under pressure from price cutting amid rough competition, he said.“Factories are moving more goods, but they’re being forced to do it at thinner margins, like street vendors selling more bowls of noodles at half price just to keep the crowd coming,” Innes said.The latest data show China’s economy is gaining momentum, with output accelerating slightly, said National Bureau of Statistics chief statistician Huo Lihui.China’s official manufacturing PMIs first slipped back into contraction in April as trade friction with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration heated up after he took office.The two sides are still slowly working their way toward a broad trade agreement after exchanging threats of sky-high tariffs on each others’ exports.A pause in steep U.S. tariff hikes on China has been extended until November, while a Sept. 19 phone call between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping offered glimmers of hope for improving relations.A truce hinges largely on a widely anticipated U.S. proposal for transferring ownership of TikTok to a U.S. company from its Chinese owner ByteDance. That would also require Beijing’s approval.A face-to-face meeting between Trump and Xi is set for the end of October in South Korea on the sidelines of an annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.China’s economy has remained in the doldrums, bogged down by a prolonged slump in the property sector, elevated unemployment and weak household spending.Some economists are hoping that a rate cut by China’s central bank by the end of the year could help encourage more spending and investment. This month, the People’s Bank of China left its key lending rates unchanged following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cut for the first time this year. —Chan Ho-Him, AP Business Writer", "source": "industry_intelligence_fast_company", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91413310/chinas-manufacturing-activity-shrank-6th-straight-month-heres-why", "published_date": "2025-09-30T16:35:44", "collected_date": "2025-09-30T18:38:59.446235", "language": "en", "tags": ["technology", "news", "business", "innovation"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Fast Company", "source_category": "industry_intelligence", "word_count": 425, "author": "Associated Press", "raw_content_length": 3449, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 2.125, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["PMI"], "persons": ["Stephen Innes"], "locations": ["China", "the United States"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2753, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Chinas manufacturing activity", "the 6th straight month", "August", "Chinas factory activity", "a sixth straight month", "September", "the longest slump", "an official report", "The official manufacturing purchasing managers index", "PMI"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["the 6th straight month"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Chinas manufacturing activity": 2.0, "the 6th straight month": 2.0, "August": 2.0, "Chinas factory activity": 1.0, "a sixth straight month": 1.0, "September": 1.0, "the longest slump": 1.0, "an official report": 1.0, "The official manufacturing purchasing managers index": 1.0, "PMI": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.253695906388889, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.7345, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.7469, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}, "uplifting_analysis": {"content_type": "business_news", "agency": 5, "progress": 5, "collective_benefit": 5, "connection": 4, "innovation": 3, "justice": 3, "resilience": 5, "wonder": 3, "reasoning": "The article describes China's manufacturing activity, highlighting improvements in PMI data and increased output, suggesting a potential gain in economic momentum.

In this paper, we theoretically explore how data geometry controls this implicit bias. This paper presents theoretical results for overparameterized two-layer ReLU networks trained below the edge of stability. First, for data distributions supported on a mixture of low-dimensional balls, we derive generalization bounds that provably adapt to the intrinsic dimension. Second, for a family of isotropic distributions that vary in how strongly probability mass concentrates toward the unit sphere, we derive a spectrum of bounds showing that rates deteriorate as the mass concentrates toward the sphere. These results instantiate a unifying principle: When the data is harder to \"shatter\" with respect to the activation thresholds of the ReLU neurons, gradient descent tends to learn representations that capture shared patterns and thus finds solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, for data that is easily shattered (e.g., data supported on the sphere) gradient descent favors memorization. Our theoretical results consolidate disparate empirical findings that have appeared in the literature.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18120",

The HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts viral hypermutation caused by the host cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G), ensuring productive infection. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) across two divergent HIV-1 clade B Vif proteins, we systematically mapped the mutational landscape governing their antagonism of A3G. These high-resolution fitness maps define conserved and adaptable regions of Vif, illuminating core principles of host-virus coevolution. Most missense mutations were strongly deleterious, reflecting pervasive purifying selection. Yet several highly conserved residues at binding interfaces with A3G, RNA, and CBF{gamma} exhibited unexpected mutational tolerance, revealing structural flexibility at these sites. Comparative analysis revealed shared constraints and striking differences between HIV-1 strains, shaped by epistatic interactions and additional selective pressures, including Vif antagonism of A3H and PP2A.

{"id": "ai_engadget_cb4138dc91dd", "title": "OpenAI completes corporate reorganization with support from Microsoft", "content": "OpenAI has completed its long, drawn-out reorganization into a public benefit corporation, the company announced today in a blog post attributed to board of directors chair Bret Taylor. As part of the reorg, OpenAI's nonprofit, now called the OpenAI Foundation, will retain control of OpenAI's for-profit division and hold an equity stake in the company valued at approximately $130 billion. According to Taylor, the Foundation will gain additional control over the for-profit once it reaches an unspecified \"valuation milestone.\" Today's announcement wouldn't have been possible without acquiescence from Microsoft, which before OpenAI recently raised more startup capital, held a 32 percent stake in the company's for-profit unit. In blog post it published alongside OpenAI, the tech giant said it would have a 27 percent stake in the new PBC, valued at approximately $135 billion. That puts the total valuation of OpenAI’s for-profit at $500 billion. Before OpenAI and Microsoft signed a memorandum of understanding in September, negotiations between the two organizations were reported to be tense, with Microsoft showing signs it was drifting away from OpenAI by working more closely with Anthropic to integrate its Claude models into Copilot 365. Now that there's an agreement in place, it appears both sides made some tough compromises. Microsoft, for instance, will continue to hold IP rights to OpenAI's models and products through 2032, with those rights covering systems the company develops after declaring artificial general intelligence. On the subject of AGI, the two companies will hire an independent panel of experts to verify any claim OpenAI makes there, when and if it reaches that milestone. However, Microsoft has agreed to waive any IP rights as they relate to OpenAI's upcoming consumer hardware — that is, the devices the company is working on with former Apple designer Jony Ive. In exchange, OpenAI has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure cloud computing services — though Microsoft also agreed it would no longer have a \"right of first refusal\" to be OpenAI's cloud provider. In the end, the most important part of today’s announcement is that it clears the way for OpenAI to become a publicly traded company. Much of the company’s financial future depended on it successfully completing this transition, and now at least it doesn’t have that burden resting on its shoulders.
