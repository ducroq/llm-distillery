## Filter Architecture

### Dimensions (8)

The uplifting filter scores content on 8 dimensions (0-10 scale):

1. **agency** - Empowerment and collective efficacy
2. **progress** - Constructive momentum toward solutions
3. **collective_benefit** - Shared prosperity and mutual gain
4. **connection** - Social cohesion and solidarity
5. **innovation** - Creative problem-solving and systems change
6. **justice** - Equity, fairness, and systemic reform
7. **resilience** - Adaptive capacity and long-term sustainability
8. **wonder** - Inspiration and expanded possibility

### Philosophy

**"MEANING not TONE"** - Focus on substantive progress, not emotional uplift. Scores systemic solutions, collective agency, and constructive momentum.

## Comparison to Previous Models

### Uplifting v4 vs Investment-Risk v2

| Metric | Uplifting v4 | Investment-Risk v2 | Difference |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Validation MAE | 0.9725 | 0.6707 | +45% harder |
| Training Examples | 5,365 | 4,118 | +30% more data |
| Epochs to Best | 8 | 3 | +167% more training |
| Model Size | 1.5B | 1.5B | Same |

**Why is uplifting harder?**
- More subjective dimensions (agency, wonder, resilience)
- Less concrete indicators compared to financial risk metrics
- Broader concept space (philosophical vs quantitative)

## Model Quality Assessment

### Strengths ✅

1. **Consistent Performance**
   - Stable validation MAE across dimensions
   - Healthy train/val gap (no overfitting)
   - All dimensions performing within acceptable range

2. **Good Generalization**
   - Only 0.122 MAE gap between train and validation
   - No dimension shows catastrophic divergence
   - Model learned meaningful patterns, not memorization

3. **Appropriate Convergence**
   - Clear plateau indicating training completion
   - No signs of underfitting or excessive overfitting
   - Optimal stopping around epoch 8

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️

1. **Harder Dimensions**
   - Resilience (1.17 MAE) and justice (1.08 MAE) higher than others
   - Could benefit from additional labeled examples
   - May require prompt refinement for these dimensions

2. **Overall MAE Higher Than Investment-Risk**
   - 0.97 vs 0.67 MAE (45% higher)
   - Expected given subjective nature of uplifting content
   - Still within acceptable range for tier classification

3. **Diminishing Returns After Epoch 5**
   - Only 1.2% improvement in epochs 6-9
   - Suggests data quantity/quality may be limiting factor
   - More training unlikely to yield significant gains

## Production Readiness

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| Validation MAE | < 1.5 | 0.9725 | ✅ PASS |
| Train/Val Gap | < 0.3 | 0.122 | ✅ PASS |
| Per-Dimension MAE | < 1.5 | All < 1.2 | ✅ PASS |
| Convergence | Stable plateau | Yes (epoch 5-9) | ✅ PASS |

### Use Case Suitability

**Tier Classification:** ✅ Suitable
- MAE of 0.97 means ~1 point average error per dimension
- Tier bands typically 2-3 points wide (e.g., 0-3, 4-6, 7-10)
- Model predictions accurate enough for tier assignment

**Continuous Scoring:** ⚠️ Moderate
- Individual dimension scores may vary ±1-1.5 points
- Good for relative ranking within batches
- Less precise for exact 0-10 scoring

**Production Filtering:** ✅ Suitable
- Combined with postfilter tier classification
- Prefilter handles obvious out-of-scope content
- Model focuses on nuanced 8-dimensional scoring

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Accept Model for Production**
   - Performance meets all targets
   - Healthy generalization patterns
   - Ready for integration testing

2. **Benchmark vs Oracle (Phase 7)**

   - Compare student predictions vs oracle scores
   - Verify tier classification accuracy

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test full pipeline: prefilter → model → postfilter
   - Verify end-to-end tier assignment
   - Check inference latency (<50ms target)

### Future Improvements

1. **Focused Data Collection for Weak Dimensions**
   - Target resilience and justice dimensions
   - Add 500-1000 examples emphasizing these concepts
   - Retrain v5 with augmented dataset

2. **Prompt Refinement**
   - Review oracle prompt for resilience/justice dimensions
   - Add more concrete indicators/examples
   - Recalibrate oracle on validation sample

3. **Model Size Exploration**
   - Try Qwen2.5-7B for potentially better performance
   - Compare cost/latency tradeoff (7B ~3x slower)
   - Evaluate if 0.85 MAE achievable with larger model
