ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Distribution Analysis:

  RED: 1.48% (expected 5-10%) - BELOW EXPECTED RANGE
  YELLOW: 11.82% (expected 10-20%) - WITHIN EXPECTED RANGE
  GREEN: 0.00% (expected 5-10%) - BELOW EXPECTED RANGE
  BLUE: 19.66% (expected 20-30%) - BELOW EXPECTED RANGE
  NOISE: 67.04% (expected 40-50%) - ABOVE EXPECTED RANGE

Quality Assessment:

RED FLAGS:
  - Actionable signal rate is very low (13.30%)
  - RED tier percentage is very low (1.48%)
  - NOISE tier percentage is very high (67.04%)

Overall Assessment:

  NEEDS REVIEW - Significant deviation from expected distribution
  1/5 tiers within expected ranges

Recommendations:

  - Consider reviewing threshold settings to increase actionable signals
  - High noise rate suggests oracle may need better content filtering
  - Low RED tier percentage may indicate thresholds are too strict
