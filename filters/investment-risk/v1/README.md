**Philosophy**: "You can't predict crashes, but you can prepare for them."

**Created**: 2025-10-30

## Overview

This filter evaluates content for **macro investment risk signals** relevant to hobby investors (‚Ç¨10K-‚Ç¨500K portfolios) practicing **defense-first portfolio management**.

### What This Filter IS
- ‚úÖ Macro risk analysis (recession signals, credit crises, systemic risk)
- ‚úÖ Capital preservation focused (when to reduce risk)
- ‚úÖ Portfolio-level guidance (asset allocation, rebalancing)
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based (Fed data, economic indicators, historical patterns)
- ‚úÖ Time-appropriate (weeks/months, not day-trading)

### What This Filter is NOT
- ‚ùå Stock picking (individual stocks, buy recommendations)
- ‚ùå Speculation (FOMO, meme stocks, crypto pumping)
- ‚ùå Day-trading advice (technical analysis, price targets)
- ‚ùå Get-rich-quick schemes (guaranteed returns, insider tips)

## Signal Tiers

| Tier | Description | Example | Action |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|
| üî¥ **RED** | Act now - reduce risk immediately | Yield curve inversion + bank crisis | Increase cash, reduce risk assets |
| üü° **YELLOW** | Monitor closely - prepare for defense | Rising unemployment + credit stress | Review portfolio, prepare rebalancing |
| üü¢ **GREEN** | Consider buying - value emerging | Extreme fear + cheap valuations | Dollar-cost average, buy quality |
| üîµ **BLUE** | Understand - no immediate action | Historical analysis, educational | Refine framework, no changes |
| ‚ö´ **NOISE** | Ignore completely | Stock tips, FOMO, pump-and-dump | Ignore |

## Pre-filter (Rule-based Blocking)

The pre-filter blocks obvious NOISE before LLM evaluation:

### Blocked Categories

1. **FOMO/Speculation** (8 patterns)
   - Hot stocks, meme stocks, crypto pumping
   - "Buy now", "don't miss out", "to the moon"
   - Get-rich-quick, guaranteed returns, 100x gains

2. **Stock Picking** (6 patterns, 6 exceptions)
   - Individual stock recommendations
   - Buy/sell ratings, price targets, earnings predictions
   - **Exception**: Allowed if macro context present (systemic risk, credit crisis, etc.)

3. **Affiliate/Conflict** (4 patterns)
   - "Sign up with this broker", promotional codes
   - Affiliate links, sponsored content
   - Discord/Telegram trading groups

4. **Clickbait** (5 patterns)
   - "Market CRASH coming!", "This ONE stock!"
   - Warren Buffett's secret, hidden gems
   - FOMO emojis (üöÄüíéüåôüí∞)

### Expected Performance
- **Pass rate**: 40-70% (conservative filtering)
- **Purpose**: Block speculation, pass macro analysis

## Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Description | Gatekeeper |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **macro_risk_severity** | 25% | Systemic economic/financial risk | - |
| **credit_market_stress** | 20% | Credit market deterioration | - |
| **market_sentiment_extremes** | 15% | Panic or euphoria extremes | - |
| **valuation_risk** | 15% | Bubble or deep value territory | - |
| **policy_regulatory_risk** | 10% | Policy errors, regulatory changes | - |
| **systemic_risk** | 15% | Contagion, cascading failures | - |
| **evidence_quality** | 0%* | Data quality, source credibility | **‚úì (‚â•5 for RED)** |
| **actionability** | 0%* | Hobby investor actionability | - |

\* evidence_quality is GATEKEEPER for RED tier (must be ‚â•5), not weighted in signal_strength
\* actionability is used for action_priority calculation, not signal_strength

## Calibration Status

### Pre-filter Calibration
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- **Sample size**: 500 articles recommended
- **Expected pass rate**: 40-70%
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  python -m ground_truth.calibrate_prefilter \
      --filter filters/investment-risk/v1 \
      --source datasets/raw/master_dataset_*.jsonl \
      --sample-size 500 \
      --output reports/investment_risk_v1_prefilter_calibration.md
  ```

### Oracle Calibration
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Pending
- **Sample size**: 100 articles recommended
- **Models to compare**: gemini-flash, gemini-pro, claude-sonnet
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  python -m ground_truth.calibrate_oracle \
      --filter filters/investment-risk/v1 \
      --source datasets/raw/master_dataset_*.jsonl \
      --sample-size 100 \
      --models gemini-flash,gemini-pro,claude-sonnet \
      --output reports/investment_risk_v1_oracle_calibration.md
  ```

---

## Ground Truth Generation

**Status**: ‚è≥ Not started

**Target**: 2,500 labeled articles

**Command**:
```bash
python -m ground_truth.batch_labeler \
    --filter filters/investment-risk/v1 \
    --source datasets/raw/master_dataset_*.jsonl \
    --target-labeled 2500 \
    --oracle gemini-flash \
    --output datasets/labeled/investment_risk_v1/
```

**Process**:
1. Stream through master datasets (99K articles)
2. Apply pre-filter (blocks 30-60% as NOISE)
3. Label passing articles with oracle (Gemini Flash)
4. Stop when 2,500 labeled articles collected

---

## Training (Planned)

**Model**: Qwen 2.5-7B

**Outputs** (multi-task):
- signal_tier (classification: RED/YELLOW/GREEN/BLUE/NOISE)
- signal_strength (regression: 0-10)
- 8 dimension scores (regression: 0-10 each)

**Target Performance**:
- Accuracy: ‚â•90% vs oracle
- Inference time: <50ms per article
- Cost: $0 per article (after training)

---

## Deployment (Planned)

**Inference Pipeline**:
1. Pre-filter (fast, local, free)
2. Qwen model (scores passing articles)

**Expected Performance**:
- Throughput: 1,000 articles/hour
- Latency: <50ms per article
- Cost: $0/article (vs $0.003 for API)

---

## Use Cases

1. **Portfolio Defense**: Identify systemic risks requiring immediate action
2. **Risk Monitoring**: Track credit market stress, policy errors, sentiment extremes
3. **Opportunity Identification**: Find value in fearful markets (GREEN signals)
4. **Education**: Learn from historical patterns and expert analysis (BLUE signals)
5. **Noise Filtering**: Block FOMO, stock tips, affiliate marketing (NOISE)
