# Future of Education Filter

**Purpose**: Identify educational transformation based on the AI Execution Paradox - execution skills become less valuable while foundational understanding becomes MORE critical.

**Target**: Gemini Flash 1.5 / Claude Haiku / Fast models

## CORE CONCEPT

AI Era Shift:
- **Execution skills** → Commoditized (AI handles it)
- **Foundational understanding** → Essential (to validate AI)
- **New meta-skill** → Knowing when to trust AI vs. human judgment

STEP 1: Pre-classification Filters

A) EDTECH PRODUCT: Product launches, LMS, AI tutoring apps, educational software?
   - If YES and NO curriculum/assessment/pedagogy changes → FLAG "edtech_product" (max_score = 3)

B) SURFACE AI LITERACY: Generic "teach AI literacy" or "learn prompt engineering" without depth?
   - If YES and NO discussion of foundational knowledge importance → FLAG "surface_ai_literacy" (max_score = 4)

C) REPLACEMENT NARRATIVE: AI replacing teachers, automated grading, job displacement?
   - If YES and NOT about human-AI collaboration → FLAG "replacement_narrative" (max_score = 3)

D) PARADOX CHECK: Does it engage with execution vs. understanding tension?
   - If NO → max_score = 5

STEP 2: Score Dimensions (0-10)

1. **Paradox Engagement**: Does it explore what becomes MORE important with AI?
   - 0-2: None | 3-4: Superficial mention | 5-6: Discusses implications | 7-8: Examples from disciplines | 9-10: Deep research-backed analysis

2. **Curricular Innovation**: Specific curriculum changes described?
   - 0-2: Vague | 3-4: General intentions | 5-6: Specific changes | 7-8: Detailed transformation | 9-10: Comprehensive redesign with outcomes

3. **Assessment Transformation**: New evaluation methods when AI can execute?
   - 0-2: None | 3-4: Mentions need | 5-6: Specific assessments | 7-8: Comprehensive strategy | 9-10: Validated framework with outcomes

4. **Pedagogical Depth**: New teaching methods/models?
   - 0-2: None | 3-4: Traditional + AI bolt-on | 5-6: Adapted approaches | 7-8: New pedagogical models | 9-10: Research-backed innovation

5. **Discipline-Specific Adaptation**: How SPECIFIC fields adapt?
   - 0-2: Discipline-agnostic | 3-4: One field vaguely | 5-6: Field-specific examples | 7-8: Deep discipline analysis | 9-10: Multiple disciplines, transferable principles

6. **Cross-Disciplinary Relevance**: Applicable beyond one context?
   - 0-2: Single institution/course | 3-4: One discipline | 5-6: Transferable to similar contexts | 7-8: Cross-disciplinary | 9-10: Universal insights

7. **Evidence & Implementation**: Research backing? Operational examples?
   - 0-2: None | 3-4: Anecdotal | 5-6: Pilot data or case study | 7-8: Multi-institutional evidence | 9-10: Peer-reviewed with outcomes

8. **Institutional Readiness**: Actually implementing (not just discussing)?
   - 0-2: Conceptual only | 3-4: Individual faculty | 5-6: Department pilots | 7-8: Institutional programs | 9-10: System-wide transformation

STEP 3: Classify Metadata

**Content Type**: curriculum_innovation | assessment_transformation | pedagogical_research | institutional_strategy | policy_framework | edtech_product | surface_discussion

**Transformation Stage**: conceptual | experimental | departmental | institutional | systemic

**Education Levels**: k12, higher_ed, professional, vocational, universal (mark true/false)

**Disciplines**: medicine, law, engineering, science, business, humanities, arts, writing, mathematics, languages (mark true/false)

**Implementation Signals**: has_curriculum_changes, has_assessment_examples, has_learning_outcomes, has_faculty_training, has_institutional_policy, has_research_validation (mark true/false)

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Focus on CURRICULAR/PEDAGOGICAL transformation, not products
- Paradox engagement critical: what becomes MORE important with AI?
- Generic "AI literacy" scores LOW unless specific about foundations
- Evidence > proposals > speculation
- Institutional implementation > individual faculty experiments

VALIDATION EXAMPLES:

HIGH SCORE (8.7/10):
Article: "Stanford Medical School eliminates anatomy memorization, replaces with 'diagnostic reasoning in AI era' course. Students use AI for differential diagnosis but must explain pathophysiology to validate outputs. New assessments test ability to catch AI errors. First cohort: 40% better diagnostic reasoning, 30% less factual recall."
Scores: Paradox=10, Curricular=9, Assessment=9, Pedagogical=8, Discipline=9, Cross-disciplinary=7, Evidence=9, Institutional=8
Reasoning: "Stanford demonstrates AI paradox in medical education: removes memorization (AI handles that), emphasizes pathophysiology (to validate AI), transforms assessments to test reasoning not recall. Evidence shows improved diagnostic reasoning with operational outcomes."

LOW SCORE (2.3/10):
Article: "EduTech Corp launches AI tutoring platform with personalized learning paths. Platform uses adaptive algorithms to generate practice problems. CEO excited about revolutionizing education. $50/student/year."
Scores: Paradox=0, Curricular=2, Assessment=0, Pedagogical=1, Discipline=0, Cross-disciplinary=3, Evidence=2, Institutional=2
Reasoning: "EdTech product announcement without curricular/pedagogical transformation. No engagement with what students need to learn differently in AI era. Traditional tutoring with AI wrapper."

## SCORING FORMULA (Applied post-labeling)

```python
score = (
    paradox_engagement * 0.30 +
    assessment_transformation * 0.20 +
    curricular_innovation * 0.15 +
    pedagogical_depth * 0.15 +
    evidence_implementation * 0.10 +
    cross_disciplinary_relevance * 0.05 +
    discipline_specific_adaptation * 0.05
)

# Apply caps
if edtech_product: score = min(score, 3.0)
if surface_ai_literacy: score = min(score, 4.0)
if replacement_narrative: score = min(score, 3.0)
if paradox_engagement < 5 and not in ['institutional_strategy', 'policy_framework']:
    score = min(score, 5.0)

# Boosts
if transformation_stage == 'systemic': score += 1.0
if has_research_validation and has_learning_outcomes: score += 0.5
score = min(10, score)
