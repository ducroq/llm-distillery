{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_f6ce788f64be","title":"Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification with Anchored Ensembles for Robust EV Power Consumption Prediction","content":"arXiv:2511.06538v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate EV power estimation underpins range prediction and energy management, yet practitioners need both point accuracy and trustworthy uncertainty. We propose an anchored-ensemble Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a Student-t likelihood that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty. Anchoring imposes a Gaussian weight prior (MAP training), yielding posterior-like diversity without test-time sampling, while the t-head provides heavy-tailed robustness and closed-form prediction intervals. Using vehicle-kinematic time series (e.g., speed, motor RPM), our model attains strong accuracy: RMSE 3.36 +/- 1.10, MAE 2.21 +/- 0.89, R-squared = 0.93 +/- 0.02, explained variance 0.93 +/- 0.02, and delivers well-calibrated uncertainty bands with near-nominal coverage. Against competitive baselines (Student-t MC dropout; quantile regression with/without anchoring), our method matches or improves log-scores while producing sharper intervals at the same coverage. Crucially for real-time deployment, inference is a single deterministic pass per ensemble member (or a weight-averaged collapse), eliminating Monte Carlo latency. The result is a compact, theoretically grounded estimator that couples accuracy, calibration, and systems efficiency, enabling reliable range estimation and decision-making for production EV energy management.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06538","published_date":"2025-11-11T05:00:00","collected_date":"2025-11-11T06:41:28.861225","language":"en","tags":["research","computer-science","preprints","cslg","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_578ce6853043","title":"Performance of an open","content":"arXiv:2510.20614v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a history matching (HM) workflow applied to the International FluidFlower benchmark study dataset, which features high-resolution images of CO$_2$ storage in a meter-scale, geologically complex reservoir. The dataset provides dense spatial and temporal observations of fluid displacement, offering a rare opportunity to validate and enhance HM techniques for geological carbon storage (GCS). The combination of detailed experimental data and direct visual observation of flow behavior at this scale is novel and valuable. This study explores the potential and limitations of using experimental data to calibrate standard models for GCS simulation. By leveraging high-resolution images and resulting interpretations of fluid phase distributions, we adjust uncertain parameters and reduce the mismatch between simulation results and observed data. Simulations are performed using the open-source OPM Flow simulator, while the open-source Everest decision-making tool is employed to conduct the HM. After the HM process, the final simulation results show good agreement with the experimental CO$_2$ storage data. This suggests that the system can be effectively described using standard flow equations, conventional saturation functions, and typical PVT properties for CO$_2$-brine mixtures. Our results demonstrate that the Wasserstein distance is a particularly effective metric for matching multi-phase, multi-component flow data. The entire workflow is implemented in a Python package named pofff (Python OPM Flow FluidFlower), which organizes all functionality through a single input file. This design ensures reproducibility and facilitates future extensions of the study.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20614","published_date":"2025-10-24T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-24T06:38:56.023522","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","preprints","physics","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics
