{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_dd647adaef52","title":"Assessing the risk of future Dunkelflaute events for Germany using generative deep learning","content":"arXiv:2509.24788v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6 ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios, the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24788","published_date":"2025-09-30T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-09-30T12:54:31.528232","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","cslg","computer-science","physicsgeo-ph","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":199,"author":"Felix Strnad, Jonathan Schmidt, Fabian Mockert, Philipp Hennig, Nicole Ludwig","raw_content_length":1351,"priority":7,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":0.995,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Dunkelflaute"],"persons":[],"locations":["Germany"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1350,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["the risk","future Dunkelflaute events","Germany","generative deep learning","arXiv250924788v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","The European electricity power grid","renewable energy sources","an increasing share","off- and onshore wind"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["generative deep learning"],"renewable_energy":["renewable energy sources"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"the risk":2.0,"future Dunkelflaute events":2.0,"Germany":2.0,"generative deep learning":2.0,"arXiv250924788v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"The European electricity power grid":1.0,"renewable energy sources":1.0,"an increasing share":1.0,"off- and onshore wind":1.0}},"age_hours":9.105901037777777,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":6.806,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.3612,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"heartwarming_score":0,"uplifting_score":0,"inspiring_score":0,"is_heartwarming":false,"is_uplifting":false,"is_inspiring":false,"emotion_method":"api"},"sustainability_tech_innovation_analysis":{"deployment_maturity":{"score":1,"reasoning":"This article describes a simulation study using deep learning to assess the risk of Dunkelflaute events.
