{"id":"science_arxiv_physics_bc66596396c7","title":"A novel spatial distribution method for wind farm parameterizations based on the Gaussian function","content":"arXiv:2510.11392v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Wind farm parameterizations are crucial for quantifying the wind-farm atmosphere interaction, where wind turbines are typically modeled as elevated momentum sinks and sources of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE). These quantities must be properly distributed to the mesoscale grid. Existing parameterizations use the single-column method. However, this method can easily lead to the errors of the spatial distribution of the sink and source, thereby impacting the accuracy of mesoscale flow simulations. To this end, we propose a multi-column spatial distribution method based on the Gaussian function. This method distributes the sink and source to multiple vertical grid columns based on the grid weights, which are analytically determined by integrating the two-dimensional Gaussian function over the mesoscale grid. We have applied this method to the classic Fitch model, proposed the improved Fitch-Gaussian model, and integrated it into the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model. Using high-fidelity large eddy simulation as a benchmark, we compared the performance of the proposed method with the single-column method. The results show that the proposed method captures the spatial distribution of the sink and source more accurately, with a higher correlation coefficient and lower normalized root mean square error. Furthermore, the Fitch-Gaussian model better captures the overall spatial distribution patterns of velocity deficit and added TKE. Therefore, the proposed method is recommended for future mesoscale wind farm simulations, especially when the influence of the wind turbine rotor spans multiple mesoscale grid columns.","source":"science_arxiv_physics","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11392","published_date":"2025-10-14T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-14T06:39:46.677941","language":"en","tags":["physicsflu-dyn","physicsao-ph","preprints","research","physics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"physics updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":240,"author":"Bowen Du, Qi Li, Mingwei Ge, Xintao Li, Yongqian Liu","raw_content_length":1698,"priority":6,"update_frequency":1,"reading_time_minutes":1.2,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["TKE"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":1697,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["A novel spatial distribution method","wind farm parameterizations","the Gaussian function","arXiv251011392v1 Announce Type","new Abstract","Wind farm parameterizations","the wind-farm atmosphere interaction","wind turbines","elevated momentum sinks","sources"],"filter_categories":{"renewable_energy":["wind turbines"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"A novel spatial distribution method":2.0,"wind farm parameterizations":2.0,"the Gaussian function":2.0,"arXiv251011392v1 Announce Type":1.0,"new Abstract":1.0,"Wind farm parameterizations":1.0,"the wind-farm atmosphere interaction":1.0,"wind turbines":1.0,"elevated momentum sinks":1.0,"sources":1.0}},"age_hours":2.7749829727777775,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"sentiment_score":7.6335,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.5267,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8497,"joy":0.0181,"surprise":0.0744,"sadness":0.0062,"fear":0.0184,"anger":0.0248,"disgust":0.0084},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_tech_innovation_analysis":{"deployment_maturity":{"score":2,"reasoning":"This article describes a new method for wind farm parameterization.

{"id":"science_mdpi_sustainability_71ecd78296e2","title":"Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 9403: Effect of Hydrogen Injection Strategy on Combustion and Emissions of Ammonia–Hydrogen Sustainable Engines","content":"Driven by the global energy transition and the dual carbon goals, developing low-carbon and zero-carbon alternative fuels has become a core issue for sustainable development in the internal combustion engine sector. Ammonia is a promising zero-carbon fuel with broad application prospects. However, its inherent combustion characteristics, including slow flame propagation, high ignition energy, and narrow flammable range, limit its use in internal combustion engines, necessitating the addition of auxiliary fuels. To address this issue, this paper proposes a composite injection technology combining “ammonia duct injection + hydrogen cylinder direct injection.” This technology utilizes highly reactive hydrogen to promote ammonia combustion, compensating for ammonia’s shortcomings and enabling efficient and smooth engine operation. This study, based on bench testing, investigated the effects of hydrogen direct injection timing (180, 170, 160, 150, 140°, 130, 120 °CA BTDC), hydrogen direct injection pressure (4, 5, 6, 7, 8 MPa) on the combustion and emissions of the ammonia–hydrogen engine. Under hydrogen direct injection timing and hydrogen direct injection pressure conditions, the hydrogen mixture ratios are 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%, respectively. Test results indicate that hydrogen injection timing that is too early or too late prevents the formation of an optimal hydrogen layered state within the cylinder, leading to prolonged flame development period and CA10-90. The peak HRR also exhibits a trend of first increasing and then decreasing as the hydrogen direct injection timing is delayed. Increasing the hydrogen direct injection pressure to 8 MPa enhances the initial kinetic energy of the hydrogen jet, intensifies the gas flow within the cylinder, and shortens the CA0-10 and CA10-90, respectively. Under five different hydrogen direct injection ratios, the CA10-90 is shortened by 9.71%, 11.44%, 13.29%, 9.09%, and 13.42%, respectively, improving the combustion stability of the ammonia–hydrogen engine.","source":"science_mdpi_sustainability","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/21/9403","published_date":"2025-10-22T00:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T18:40:25.040249","language":"en","tags":["sustainability","environment","open-access","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"Sustainability","source_category":"science","word_count":290,"author":"Heng Wu","raw_content_length":2101,"priority":6,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":1.45,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":[],"persons":[],"locations":["Ammonia"],"monetary":[]},"char_count":2035,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Ammonia","Sustainability","Pages","Effect","Hydrogen Injection Strategy","Combustion","Emissions","Hydrogen Sustainable Engines","the global energy transition","the dual carbon goals"],"filter_categories":{"ai_ml":["Sustainability"],"hydrogen_energy":["Hydrogen Injection Strategy"]},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Ammonia":3.0,"Sustainability":2.0,"Pages":2.0,"Effect":2.0,"Hydrogen Injection Strategy":2.0,"Combustion":2.0,"Emissions":2.0,"Hydrogen Sustainable Engines":2.0,"the global energy transition":1.0,"the dual carbon goals":1.0}},"age_hours":18.987660776388886,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"4e868e9f2c1413c1cb170e03e71c56c1","title_md5":"2e694438dc8e47ba101d994d9abe0796","url_normalized":"d31284290ae0bb17ceb4d16324bf0922","minhash_signature":["9837667","25550307","4229889","4472875","498956","5697402","4247212","15275055","2645416","6530655","9991314","2763186","2343024","1166689","953500","7389182","3295588","7714487","4032655","113500","1196901","88593","433252","5079694","6579678","14879648","7507083","9160874","6998512","6873188","14630227","87553","5831476","9969046","527571","880599","6931107","1308923","309467","9516670","23906897","2268139","22122233","1785966","16082614","5244114","907311","2889270","1132398","4849158","4846679","843096","6291595","214699","4636596","1909511","226173","1654059","4656097","1151625","2318646","1311296","1936","4050641","7601","7689844","9932183","3312365","3843993","16095619","5786666","1755940","1027009","4528274","7951082","3487483","269839","814536","2905045","5233235","5332671","1969868","4401012","14909818","1595927","2319043","4602115","9907722","6430507","8318141","7678043","2175767","9012833","436779","6944573","5560495","1608076","9397847","16833010","5834464","9845597","10009000","12264772","5883140","1684279","3376316","6409355","8930836","12007630","44001","9498389","120729","3010402","2523889","3003144","19721175","120732","6972897","5108334","2957551","6123858","3670321","133333","7407467","9071155","360512","9098556","5084848"],"title_minhash":["24942206","33813107","4229889","8077882","46183253","109338289","34735912","86163060","81610431","35144584","20538255","273080775","163247","1166689","17117614","11713604","1963268","88149043","11871368","27092315","56300657","9213874","1386815","152654545","90683155","53357089","35699214","13763274","21652241","21147669","29272303","37703583","5807442","9969046","7626088","83942052","28724667","6836305","7167732","67259777","66062348","39707560","220014259","1785966","146602929","75248562","3043650","33566799","121244675","32491597","52674268","54016425","19333165","10539494","4636596","14402816","13936994","5017529","31641249","21256722","3404386","59059947","22733522","19144598","1886331","134192844","51148002","4355909","3843993","96477436","19680712","40725368","51208386","4528274","7951082","3487483","35329650","6134367","112799721","13899315","33732323","21564890","129734161","81141734","1595927","26426332","63719876","28588555","45356248","8318141","95664462","17372915","26700999","24365956","15637739","84291554","2811152","9397847","63632427","35832301","24138410","155418664","14554737","5883140","8090509","65981363","143646446","19952876","12007630","6841584","14347585","120729","26534242","73363302","9652365","19721175","70753876","17931612","37361353","56833314","16727492","5521808","952385","54666452","9071155","11981119","18750775","37319798"],"combined_hash":"01193e1483beda7d24d5448b5a642c56"},"sentiment_score":8.591999999999999,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"high","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.7184,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.8198,"joy":0.0535,"surprise":0.0183,"sadness":0.0106,"fear":0.0249,"anger":0.0292,"disgust":0.0436},"emotion_method":"local"},"sustainability_tech_innovation_analysis":{"deployment_maturity":{"score":3,"reasoning":"The article describes bench testing of a composite injection technology.

{"id":"arxiv_aa3b179a14d4","title":"Helium-3 Enrichment in Gradual Solar Energetic Particle Events: Evidence for Jet","content":"Enhancements in 3He abundance, a characteristic feature of impulsive solar energetic particle (ISEP) events, are also frequently observed in gradual SEP (GSEP) events. Understanding the origin of this enrichment is crucial for identifying the mechanisms behind SEP generation. We investigate the origin of 3He enrichment in high-energy (25-50 MeV) solar proton events observed by SOHO, selecting events that coincide with <1 MeV/nucleon 3He-rich periods detected by ACE during 1997-2021. The identified 3He enhancements include cases where material from independent impulsive (3He-rich) SEP events is mixed with GSEP proton populations. Two high-energy proton events exhibit elemental composition and solar source characteristics consistent with ISEPs. Extreme-ultraviolet imaging from SDO and STEREO reveals narrow, jet-like eruptions in the parent active regions of about 60% of the remaining events. Notably, the highest 3He/4He ratios occur when coronal jets are present, consistent with fresh, jet-driven injection of suprathermal 3He that is subsequently re-accelerated during the event. Correspondingly, jet-associated events show fewer pre-event (residual) 3He counts, indicating that enrichment in these cases does not primarily come from remnant material.

{"id":"positive_news_the_better_india_e083f6f7923a","title":"From Manipur to Maharashtra, Meet 7 Indians Lighting up Villages With Simple Solar Ideas","content":"As homes across India flicker to life this Diwali, millions celebrate the light they already have. But in the forgotten folds of the country, that light is still being fought for — one solar panel, one wire, one dream at a time. In villages where the grid never arrived, lamps don’t just brighten rooms; they guard children walking home, power a farmer’s pump, and give women the freedom to work past sunset. This is the story of those who turned the sun into survival — the engineers, students, and communities who refused to let darkness decide their lives. 1. Manipur: When a loom hums after dusk In Manipur’s misty hills, evenings once ended livelihoods. Power looms fell silent, and children turned to the dull glow of kerosene lamps. That changed when Seth Moirangthem, a graduate who spent years working with non-profits, founded SNL Energy Solutions in 2019 to bring solar power to villages off the grid. Seth’s solar systems now light 1,000 homes in Manipur’s hills, helping weavers, potters and students work past sunset. A 40-watt panel that lights a three-room home costs around Rs 18,000; larger 1-kW systems keep power looms and sewing machines running through the night. “Solar energy is catalysing empowerment for women and helping children’s dreams flourish,” Seth says.Potter Ibomcha in Kakching now earns Rs 350 a day on his solar-powered wheel. On Loktak Lake, floating huts glow till dawn, their reflections rippling across the water. Despite unrest and rough roads, Seth’s systems now power more than 1,000 homes across Manipur and the Northeast. 2. Rajasthan to the Northeast: The rise of solar sisters In Nichlagarh, Rajasthan, Thavri Devi once lived in darkness and silence. A five-month solar engineering course in Harmada transformed her from homemaker to technician — and gave her voice and pride. She now earns Rs 5,700 a month repairing and installing solar systems. Harsh’s initiative has trained 300 women across 10 states as solar engineers powering homes and confidence alike. She is among 300 women across 10 states trained by EMPBindi International, led by Harsh Tiwari, to become “solar sisters” — local engineers who maintain decentralised energy systems. These women also identify livelihood needs and deploy dryers, cookstoves, torches, and microgrids. Harsh remembers one young woman placing a chair at the centre of a men-only panchayat meeting and saying, “I am a solar engineer now, and I got this right.” The room, and the idea of who holds power, changed that day. 3. A student’s bulb that acts as an inverter When Uday Bhatia, then in Class 12, visited Uttar Pradesh’s Bichpuri village, he saw students struggling through 10-hour power cuts. Back home, he turned his terrace into a lab, building 24 prototypes of an inverter bulb that glows for up to 10 hours during outages. Uday’s Rs 250 solar bulb now lights 10,000 homes across 20 states, proving that innovation can start on a terrace. He launched Uday Electric in 2022, pricing each bulb at Rs 250. It has since reached 10,000 homes across 20 states and earned him the Diana Award 2023. Vendors in rural markets sell the bulbs, creating new incomes along the way. “Even with the power cut,” Uday says, “there will still be light.” 4. Jharkhand and Maharashtra: How communities run their own grids When engineers Sameer Nair, Anshuman Lath, and Prasad Kulkarni travelled through Jharkhand in 2015, they saw villages that went dark every evening. They asked a simple question: What if the power belonged to the people? Through their initiative ‘Gram Oorja’, they helped communities build and run solar microgrids, with villagers contributing funds, setting tariffs, and handling maintenance. “Every family pays Rs 100 a month,” says Suchita Ba of Simdega. “When we put our own money, we feel responsible.” Sameer and his team have helped 150 villages run their own solar grids, powering farms and lives sustainably. Today, over 150 villages manage their own clean energy. A survey found 102 of 104 microgrids still operational after eight years. The team has also installed 770 solar pumps, irrigating 4,000 acres of farmland. For farmer Ambadas Bhoye, once forced to migrate for daily wages, this light brought stability. His fields now glow with okra, pumpkin, and beans — a harvest powered by community. 5. Karnataka: Power that comes with care A dead fan in a classroom once stayed with Sohan Naik long after he left school. Years later, as head of Power Planet, the company his parents founded, he built a solar model rooted in reliability. Sohan’s team powers 2,700 homes and 350 small businesses across Karnataka with reliable solar systems built to last. “Solar must work on day one and still work on day 1,000,” he says. His team installs and monitors rooftop systems across Karnataka, visiting quarterly and training locals to handle repairs. Over 2,700 homes and 350 small businesses now run on Power Planet systems. When clients upgrade, the firm refurbishes old panels and sells them to farmers at half price — spreading light and trust in equal measure. 6. Kerala: Making old inverters solar-smart In Malappuram, Suresh Vijayakumar barely notices power cuts anymore. His home runs on iCUBE, a high-efficiency solar UPS from Energy24by7, founded by Harsh Mohan, Nishanth C P, Dr Vinod Gopal, Lakshmi Nambiar, and Kiran S. Their first product, iCON, made old inverters solar-compatible; iCUBE refined it further, achieving 97 percent efficiency and automatic source-switching. Harsh and his co-founders at Energy24by7 power 1,000-plus homes with solar UPS systems across India and Africa. During a storm that blacked out his neighbourhood for five days, Suresh’s lights stayed on. His electricity bills have since halved, and he now advocates solar adoption to neighbours. Energy24by7 serves over 1,000 homes across southern India, with pilots in Africa — proof that good ideas can travel anywhere sunlight reaches. “The best innovation,” says Harsh, “is the one people can afford, understand, and use every day.” 7. Maharashtra: A portable sun for those on the move For Katkari and Kunbi families in Mulshi, Pune, darkness once meant fear — of leopards, isolation, and lost hours of learning. Tanveer Inamdar, a mechanical engineer, launched Mission Urja in 2022 to change that through portable solar units that families can fold, carry, and use wherever they go.Each three-kg system powers bulbs and fans; Urja Committees manage upkeep and collect small monthly fees. So far, 945 families have gained power across Maharashtra, with partners like Netcracker Technologies and Persistent Foundation supporting the mission.“Imagine visiting a village once cloaked in darkness,” Tanveer says. “A few months later, it glows with light.” Tanveer’s Mission Urja has lit 945 tribal homes in Maharashtra, bringing safety, study hours and hope after dark. This Diwali, The Better India has joined hands with Tanveer’s Mission Urja to take that glow further — to light up 500 homes across seven Mulshi villages for just Rs 800 each. Every solar light comes with an 18-hour backup, bringing safety, study hours, and peace to families like Swapnali’s, who dreams of returning to school, and Balu Katkar’s, who hopes to no longer look over his shoulder for leopards. If you’d like to be the reason a family in Mulshi sees its first light this Diwali, [click here to donate] — because in these villages, light isn’t luxury, it’s life. The afterglow Light changes posture. It lets a mother pull up a chair at the panchayat table, a child finish one more chapter, a farmer stay for a second crop, and a weaver complete her order. It carries comfort, courage, and the assurance that tomorrow will be brighter. On this festival of lamps, these are the flames to remember — the ones that last, that travel from one roof to the next, carrying a simple promise: that no one should be left in the dark.","source":"positive_news_the_better_india","source_type":"rss","url":"https://thebetterindia.com/changemakers/solar-changemakers-lighting-up-rural-india-sustainable-energy-innovation-impact-10572427","published_date":"2025-10-20T03:30:37","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:21.674926","language":"en","tags":["social_good","innovation","sustainability","india","explore_all_stories","changemakers","positive_news"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"The
