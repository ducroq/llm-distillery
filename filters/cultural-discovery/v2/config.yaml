        0-2: No discovery element (routine news, general knowledge)
        3-4: Minor insight or lesser-known fact surfaced
        5-6: Meaningful discovery (new interpretation, recovered artifact, revealed connection)
        7-8: Significant discovery (changes understanding, major find, breakthrough research)
        9-10: Transformative discovery (rewrites history, paradigm shift, lost civilization found)
      evidence_focus: "What's new here? What didn't we know before?"

    heritage_significance:
      weight: 0.20
      category: discovery
      description: "Cultural or historical importance of the subject matter"
