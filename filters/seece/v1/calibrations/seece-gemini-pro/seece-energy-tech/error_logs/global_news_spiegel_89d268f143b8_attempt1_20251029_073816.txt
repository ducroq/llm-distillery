While relevant to SEECE's mobility electrification domain, this article highlights a problem with a mature, proprietary system (TRL 9), offering no direct applied research or collaboration opportunities. Its primary value is educational, as a case study on the challenges of AI validation and safety in autonomous systems.",
  "reasoning": "The article reports on a safety failure of a deployed commercial technology (Tesla FSD), which falls under mobility electrification. However, its high TRL (9) and proprietary nature make it a poor fit for SEECE's applied research focus (TRL 4-7). The intelligence
