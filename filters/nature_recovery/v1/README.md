# Nature Recovery Filter

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active development (promoted from todo/ 2025-12-28)
**Philosophy**: "Nature Can Recover (when we stop breaking it)"
**Purpose**: Identify documented ecosystem recovery - proving that action works

## Next Steps
- [ ] Develop harmonized prompt (follow uplifting v5 structure)
- [ ] Create prefilter.py
- [ ] Create postfilter.py
- [ ] Validate on 50+ articles
- [ ] Score training data

## Key Dimensions
1. Ecosystem Health (30%) - Species/biodiversity recovery
2. Pollution Reduction (25%) - Air/water quality improvements
3. Restoration Scale (15%) - Hectares protected/restored
4. Recovery Speed (10%) - How fast nature bounces back
5. Permanence (8%) - Protected status
6. Connectivity (5%) - Wildlife corridors
7. Historical Validation (4%) - Proven before (ozone, acid rain)
8. Attribution (3%) - Policy-driven recovery

## Examples
- **Ozone layer (9.5)**: 40 years ahead of schedule - Montreal Protocol worked
- **Beijing air quality (8.2)**: PM2.5 fell 50% in decade
- **Bald eagles (7.9)**: DDT ban → population recovered
- **Amazon burning (1.5)**: Decline, not recovery

Part of 5-pillar framework. Provides hope through evidence that action works.
