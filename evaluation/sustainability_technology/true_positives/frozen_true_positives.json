    "content": "arXiv:2512.15432v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Digital twins of radio access networks require packet-level traffic generators that reproduce the size and timing of packets while remaining compact and easy to recalibrate as traffic changes. We address this need with a hybrid generator that combines a small hidden Markov model, which captures buffering, streaming, and idle states, with a mixture density network that models the joint distribution of payload length and inter-arrival time (IAT) in each state using Student-t mixtures. The state space and emission family are designed to handle heavy-tailed IAT by anchoring an explicit idle state in the tail and allowing each component to adapt its tail thickness. We evaluate the model on public traces of web, smart home, and encrypted media traffic and compare it with recent neural network and transformer based generators as well as hidden Markov baselines. Across most datasets and metrics, including average per-flow cumulative distribution functions, autocorrelation based measures of temporal structure, and Wasserstein distances between flow descriptors, the proposed generator matches the real traffic most closely in the majority of cases while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters. The full model occupies around 0.2 MB in our experiments, which makes it suitable for deployment inside digital twins where memory footprint and low-overhead adaptation are critical.",

    "content": "Sustainable language education necessitates scalable, accessible learning environments that foster long-term learner autonomy and reduce educational inequality. While online courses have democratized access to language learning globally, persistent deficiencies in instructor-student interaction and learner engagement compromise their sustainability. The “face effect,” denoting the influence of instructor facial appearance on learning outcomes, remains underexplored as a resource-efficient mechanism for enhancing engagement in digital environments. Furthermore, effective measures linking psychological engagement to sustained learning experiences are notably absent. This study addresses three research questions within a sustainable education framework: (1) How does instructor identity, particularly facial appearance, affect second language learners’ outcomes and interactivity in scalable online environments? (2) How can digital human technology dynamically personalize instructor appearance to support diverse learner populations in resource-efficient ways? (3) How does instructor identity influence learners’ flow state, a critical indicator of intrinsic motivation and self-directed learning capacity? Two controlled experiments with Japanese language learners examined three instructor identity conditions: real teacher identity, learner self-identity, and idol-inspired identity. Results demonstrated that the self-identity condition significantly enhanced oral performance and flow state dimensions, particularly concentration and weakened self-awareness. These findings indicate that identity-adaptive digital human instructors cultivate intrinsic motivation and learner autonomy, which are essential competencies for lifelong learning. This research advances Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) by demonstrating that adaptive educational technology can simultaneously improve learning outcomes and psychological engagement in scalable, cost-effective online environ",

Yet it faces significant connectivity challenges, particularly with the sensors that power this technology. An efficient sensor deployment solution is still required to maximize the network's detection capabilities and efficiency while minimizing resource consumption and operational costs. This paper introduces an innovative sensor allocation optimization method that employs a Gradient-Based Iteration with Lagrange. The proposed method enhances coverage by utilizing a hybrid approach while minimizing the number of sensor nodes required under grid-based allocation. The proposed sensor distribution outperformed the classic deterministic deployment across coverage, number of sensors, cost, and power consumption. Furthermore, scalability is enhanced by extending sensing coverage to the remaining area via Bluetooth, which has a shorter communication range. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieved 98.5% wireless sensor coverage, compared with 95% for the particle swarm distribution.",

    "content": "Substrate amendment is a promising strategy to enhance phytoremediation in degraded coastal wetlands, yet the selection of optimal materials and their incorporation ratios remains challenging. This study systematically investigated the effects of five amendments, viz., manganese sand, maifan stone, bentonite, iron–carbon (Fe-C), and vermiculite, across an incorporation ratio gradient (5–40%) on the growth of the mangrove, Kandelia obovata, and the physicochemical properties of coastal wetland substrate. Results demonstrated material-specific and dose-dependent responses. Four amendments (vermiculite, Fe-C, manganese sand, and maifan stone) promoted Kandelia obovata growth to varying degrees, while bentonite exhibited significant inhibition. All amendments ensured the physical stability of the substrate. Nutrient removal efficiency followed the order: Fe-C > vermiculite > maifan stone > manganese sand, with 10% Fe-C showing the highest comprehensive nutrient removal. Conversely, bentonite functioned as a nutrient enrichment agent. The amendments differentially influenced redox potential, CO2 emissions, and electrical conductivity, yet all maintained a stable substrate pH. A comprehensive evaluation considering plant growth, nutrient removal, and CO2 sequestration identified maifan stone as the optimal amendment, with the 40% incorporation ratio delivering the most favorable integrated performance. This study provides critical, ratio-specific guidance for selecting and applying substrate amendments in coastal wetland restoration.

    "content": "Deep-sea cages are highly susceptible to biofouling due to long-term seawater immersion, which promotes the attachment and growth of marine organisms on nets, significantly reducing fish survival. To address this issue, this study explores the use of low-pressure abrasive water jets (LPAWJs) for cage fouling removal through numerical simulation. Based on a Box-Behnken response surface design, nozzle inlet pressure X1, nozzle outlet diameter X2, and target distance X3 were selected as optimization parameters. The peak jet impact force Z1, stable jet impact force Z2, peak abrasive water jet velocity Z3, and peak abrasive particle velocity Z4 were chosen as evaluation indicators to characterize the jet’s instantaneous impact ability, sustained action ability, and dynamic particle behavior. Using the entropy method, weights for each indicator were determined, and the jet’s overall removal capability was calculated. A regression model was developed by integrating numerical simulation with the response surface methodology (RSM), and the optimal parameter combination was identified as X1 = 4.5 MPa, X2 = 10 mm, and X3 = 205.396 mm. Compared with the poorest experimental condition (Condition 1), the jet’s overall removal capability obtained under the optimal parameter combination increases by 101.35%. Experimental validation further confirms that the optimized parameters yield the best oyster-removal performance of the low-pressure abrasive jet, with the average removal rate improving by 100.55% relative to Condition 1. The methodology and results of this study provide a theoretical foundation and technical reference for the design and optimization of automated net-cleaning systems or net-cleaning robots equipped with low-pressure abrasive jets.

    "content": "We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled \"Commonsense-STEM-Agent\" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.",

    "content": "AI is no longer the future of healthcare; it’s already reshaping how patients are diagnosed and treated. Some of the most interesting developments involve systems that sense and respond to human emotion. Cedars-Sinai’s Connect platform, for example, adapts care based on patient sentiment; CompanionMx interprets vocal and facial cues to detect anxiety; and Feel Therapeutics uses emotion-sensing wearables to tailor interventions in real time. At the same time, clinical tools are evolving. Hospitals are pairing large language models (LLMs) with AI note-taking apps such as Nabla and Heidi, which can listen, summarize, and respond to the nuances of doctor–patient conversations. Investment in medical scribing technologies alone hit around $800 million last year. A SHIFT TO AI ADAPTATION All of this points to a bigger shift from AI that automates tasks to AI that adapts. Traditional AI sped up paperwork and crunched data. Adaptive AI helps clinicians make better judgments, understand patients more deeply, and respond in context. You can already see this shift in breast cancer screening, genomics, and drug discovery, where high quality data and constant validation are driving real progress. Emotionally-aware tools, when designed responsibly, can strengthen the connection between clinicians and patients, personalize care, and ease pressure on overstretched systems. But as adaptive AI becomes more widely available, success depends less on technical brilliance and more on how systems are built. The tools that succeed will be able to flex around people, fitting patients’ needs, clinicians’ workflows, and the realities of care. Good AI needs to be anticipatory and sensitive to context, built for the full diversity of patients. Even the most empathetic AI cannot, of course, erase the imperfections of human systems.

    "content": "The deparser stage in the Protocol-Independent Switch Architecture (PISA) is often overshadowed by parser and match-action optimizations. Yet, it remains a critical performance bottleneck in P4-programmable FPGA data planes. Challenges associated with the deparser stem from dynamic header layouts, variable emission orders, and alignment constraints, which often necessitate resource-intensive designs, such as wide, dynamic crossbar routing. While compile-time specialization techniques can reduce logic usage, they sacrifice runtime adaptability: any change to the protocol graph, including adding, removing, or reordering headers, requires full hardware resynthesis and re-implementation, limiting their practicality for evolving or multi-tenant workloads. This work presents a unified FPGA-targeted deparser architecture that merges templated and overlay concepts within a hardware–software co-design framework. At design time, template parameters define upper bounds on protocol complexity, enabling resource-efficient synthesis tailored to specific workloads. Within these bounds, runtime reconfiguration is supported through overlay control tables derived from static deparser DAG analysis, which capture the per-path emission order, header alignments, and offsets. These tables drive protocol-agnostic, chunk-based emission blocks that eliminate the overhead of crossbar interconnects, thereby significantly reducing complexity and resource usage. The proposed design sustains high throughput while preserving the flexibility needed for in-field updates and long-term protocol evolution.",

    "content": "High-power magnets undergird an enormous amount of modern society. From high-end audio speakers to electric vehicles, wind turbines, and fighter jets, they are a vital component in much of the technology we touch every day. To make them requires mining and refining rare earth elements—a supply chain largely controlled by China. Companies around the world are racing to find alternatives by using materials that are more abundant and cheaper to produce domestically. Minneapolis-based Niron Magnetics believes it has found a solution, claiming it can approach key aspects of rare earth magnet performance, using humble iron and nitrogen—albeit in an exotic formulation. General Motors, Stellantis, the U.S. government, and others are betting on it. “The Chinese put export controls in place around rare earths, and that’s been a great benefit to us,” says Niron CEO Jonathan Rowntree. China currently accounts for around 60% of global rare earth mining, according to the International Energy Agency, and about 90% of refining (including ore mined in and shipped from the U.S.). It also supplies over 90% of rare earth magnets, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Geopolitical tensions are putting that supply in jeopardy. “We want to be able to solve this problem for Western companies as quickly as possible,” Rowntree says. When asked if Niron will only serve the West, he says, “All these countries outside of China have the same problem.” Beyond the U.S., Niron plans to build one factory somewhere in Europe and another in Asia. “It won’t be in China. It’ll be in Southeast Asia, most likely,” he says. Moving beyond neodymium Companies—and governments—are especially chasing alternatives to one of these rare earth metals: neodymium.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10396v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-horizon agricultural planning requires optimizing crop allocation under complex spatial heterogeneity, temporal agronomic dependencies, and multi-source environmental uncertainty. Existing approaches often treat crop interactions, such as legume-cereal complementarity, which implicitly or rely on static deterministic formulations that fail to guarantee resilience against market and climate volatility. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Layer Robust Crop Planning Framework (MLRCPF) that integrates spatial reasoning, temporal dynamics, and robust optimization. Specifically, we formalize crop-to-crop relationships through a structured interaction matrix embedded within the state-transition logic, and employ a distributionally robust optimization layer to mitigate worst-case risks defined by a data-driven ambiguity set. Evaluations on a real-world high-mix farming dataset from North China demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The framework autonomously generates sustainable checkerboard rotation patterns that restore soil fertility, significantly increasing the legume planting ratio compared to deterministic baselines. Economically, it successfully resolves the trade-off between optimality and stability. These results highlight the importance of explicitly encoding domain-specific structural priors into optimization models for resilient decision-making in complex agricultural systems.",

    "content": "On a foggy January morning in Delhi, many rooftop solar owners open their monitoring apps and feel a familiar anxiety. The units generated overnight look disappointingly low. Messages start flying on housing society WhatsApp groups: “Are the panels not working?”, “Does solar fail in winter?” Similar doubts surface in Shimla after a snowfall, or in Leh, where the sun feels piercingly bright but the air is bitterly cold. How can solar power work when it’s freezing? And why does it struggle in cities that are technically warmer? The answer lies in a mix of physics, geography, and something far closer to home: air quality. Winter smog in Delhi scatters sunlight, cutting solar irradiance and lowering rooftop power output. Representational image source: Gursimran Kaur/RenewableWatch The truth is simpler—and more reassuring—than many people realise. Solar panels do not stop working in winter. In fact, cold weather can improve their efficiency. What really affects winter performance in India is how much sunlight reaches the panels, and what stands between the sun and your roof. Solar panels run on light, not heat A common misconception is that solar panels need warmth to function. They do not. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels generate electricity when sunlight—made up of tiny particles called photons—hits a semiconductor material, usually silicon. These photons knock electrons loose, creating an electric current. As long as light reaches the panel, electricity can be produced. Panels are tested under standard laboratory conditions: a cell temperature of 25°C and sunlight intensity of 1,000 watts per square metre. Real rooftops, however, rarely match these conditions. Two factors mainly determine how much power a panel generates: How much sunlight reaches it (known as solar irradiance) How hot the panel itself becomes Here’s the counterintuitive part: solar panels actually lose efficiency as they get hotter. Most crystalline silicon panels used in India lose about 0.3% to 0.5%",

    "content": "Rapid integration of renewable energy sources poses a serious problem to the functionality of microgrids since they are characterized by underlying uncertainties and variability. This paper proposes a multi-stage approach to energy management to overcome these issues in a virtual power plant that combines heterogeneous microgrids. The solution is based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to coordinate internal energy pricing, microgrid scheduling, and virtual power plant-level energy storage system management. The proposed model autonomously learns the optimal dynamic pricing strategies based on load and generation dynamics, which is efficient in dealing with operational uncertainties and maintaining microgrid privacy due to its decentralized structure. The efficiency of the proposed solution is tested on comparative simulations based on real-world data, which prove the superiority of the framework to the traditional operation modes, which are isolated microgrids and the energy sharing scenarios. The findings prove that the suggested solution has a dual beneficial impact on both virtual power plant operators and involved microgrids, as it leads to profit enhancement and, at the same time, system stability. This process facilitates the successful balancing of conflicting interests among the stakeholders at a time when the operation is low-carbon. The study offers an overall solution to dealing with complicated multi-microgrids and brings substantial changes in the integration of renewable energy, as well as the distributed management of energy resources. The framework is a scalable model that can be used in the future perspective of power systems with high-renewable penetration to address both economic and operational issues of the contemporary energy grids.",

This study investigates the multitemporal variation in vegetation biomass within the Cioclovina–Șura Mare–Piatra Roșie strictly protected area of the Grădiștea Muncelului–Cioclovina Natural Park (Southern Carpathians, Romania), using vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for the 2018–2022 period. Four complementary indices (NDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, and LAI) were computed and normalized, then integrated into an original synthetic indicator (BCIS—Biomass Change Integrated Score) for quantifying biomass changes. The results indicate an overall reduction in vegetation biomass, with 89.49% of the area classified under degradation trends, while 4.53% shows regeneration processes. Grasslands and mixed agricultural–natural lands are the most affected habitats, where degradation is linked to anthropogenic pressures and ecotonal vulnerability, whereas broadleaf forests display a high degree of resilience, maintaining substantial proportions of stable or regenerating surfaces. The multispectral integration through the BCIS indicator enabled a more robust detection of critical zones, supporting sustainable vegetation management and biodiversity monitoring in protected mountain ecosystems.",

    "content": "Two years ago, a $575 million battery factory planned in St. Louis, Missouri, was set to be the first large-scale lithium iron phosphate (LFP) facility in the U.S. This November, after the Trump administration withdrew a grant for the project, it was cancelled—becoming one of more than 50 major clean energy projects to be scrapped or scaled back in 2025. From January through November, as federal policy turned against clean energy, companies abandoned more than $32 billion in investments, according to the most recent data from E2, a nonpartisan organization that tracks clean energy projects in the U.S. Some companies are still announcing new projects, but lost investments are now outpacing them by three to one. “The scale of cancellations shows how fragile this moment is for America’s clean energy economy,” says Michael Timberlake, director of research at E2. The list includes a new $4.3 billion General Motors EV plant in Michigan that’s being retooled to make gas-powered vehicles, a $3.2 billion Stellantis battery factory in Illinois that was cancelled, and a $2.6 billion battery factory in Georgia that was scrapped by a Norway-based manufacturer, among dozens of other projects. The majority of the cancelled projects are factories, not clean energy generation plants, though some solar or wind farms may not show up on the list because their cancellations are harder to track. (Though there is some evidence the administration is changing its mind about batteries, specifically.) The cuts add up to nearly 40,000 lost jobs, according to E2. Republican congressional districts lost the most large-scale projects, 37 in total. What’s harder to track than cancellations is how many projects might have been announced under different political conditions that now won’t ever break ground. Up until the 2024 election, Timberlake says monthly announcements consistently exceeded $1 billion in investment. Last month, that total was $550 million—less than the value of the cancelled batt",

    "content": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the conversion of Podocarpus falcatus seed oil into biodiesel using a calcium-oxide–cerium-oxide (CaO–CeO₂) heterogeneous composite catalyst. The work addresses the critical need for sustainable non-edible feedstocks and robust catalysts that overcome the drawbacks of conventional homogeneous systems, such as soap formation, poor recyclability, and high wastewater generation. The CaO-CeO₂ composite catalyst was synthesized through ethanol-assisted impregnation and calcination at 550 °C, yielding a nanocrystalline structure with high surface reactivity. Transesterification parameters including temperature, reaction time, catalyst loading, and methanol to-oil molar ratio were optimized using response surface methodology based on a central composite design. The optimum conditions (63.2 °C, 1.52 h, 1.59 wt% catalyst, and 11.82:1 molar ratio) produced a maximum biodiesel yield of 98.32%, with strong model correlation (R² = 0.9916) validated by analysis of variance. Physicochemical characterization confirmed compliance with international fuel standards, while gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy verified complete conversion of triglycerides to methyl esters. The biodiesel exhibited acceptable oxidative stability (induction period = 26.5 h), high cetane number, and favorable cold-flow properties, indicating suitability for compression-ignition engines. The catalyst maintained over 78% activity after eight reuse cycles, confirming its durability and economic viability. This work introduces Podocarpus falcatus as a novel indigenous biodiesel feedstock and establishes CaO-CeO₂ composites as an efficient, reusable, and environmentally benign catalyst system for sustainable fuel production.\nData availability\nAll data generated or analyzed in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

    "content": "Foliar application of fertilizers and bioactive compounds helps viticulture adapt to climate change, while biochar (BC) derived from grapevine pruning residues (GPRs) represents a versatile material that further contributes to climate change mitigation. In this study, the foliar application impact of seven different formulations on the chemical composition and quality of must and wine of Malvazija istarska (Vitis vinifera L.) was investigated. The suspensions contained various combinations of BC, urea, and amino acids. BC increased the pH of the solutions in which it was present due to its alkaline nature, thereby influencing the uptake of nutrients and other compounds. Treatments C (control) and A (amino acids) led to the highest amount of yeast-assimilable nitrogen (YAN) (170 and 172 mg N/L). The amino acid profile of the must differed from the typical composition, with glutamine identified as the predominant compound. The combination of BC with urea and amino acids was associated with a higher sugar concentration in the must compared to the application of BC alone, ranging from 208 to 223 g/L. Combining BC with other components led to wines that received superior sensory evaluation scores compared to both C and B. BC alone did not influence must or wine quality. However, its application in combination with other components makes it a suitable carrier for such compounds. Due to its benefits, easy and cheap production, foliar application of BC suspensions with fertilizers can become a standard operation in viticulture and contribute to sustainable fertilization.",

    "content": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soils poses a significant threat to food safety and human health, especially in rice-consuming regions. This study aimed to identify rice cultivars with consistently low Cd accumulation and to establish a soil quality standard based on the bioconcentration factor (BCF) derived from field trials across 10 environments in central Taiwan. Fifteen rice cultivars were evaluated over four years (2020-2023), and BCF values were determined for each cultivar and environment. Genotypic and environmental effects on Cd accumulation were assessed using genotype plus genotype-by-environment (GGE) biplot analysis. The results indicated that environmental factors contributed the most to BCF variability (93.11%), followed by genotype-environment interaction (5.61%) and genotypic effect (1.28%). Several cultivars, including KH139 and TT30, exhibited stable and low BCF values across environments. Furthermore, the BCF values were used to construct a species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curve fitted with the Burr Type III distribution, and the HC5 value was estimated for the derivation of food safety and health-based Cd soil thresholds. The former's soil threshold was 0.7 mg/kg, while the latter's ranged from 4.5-6.0 mg/kg depending on gender. The results suggest that the soil Cd threshold can be maintained at the current Taiwan's soil pollution control standard of 5 mg/kg. These findings provide scientific evidence for the development of site-specific, risk-based soil management strategies and cultivar selection to mitigate Cd exposure from rice consumption.",

    "content": "Amidst the paradigm shift in park city development from quantitative metrics to spatial performance, urban complex parks—a novel green space type developed privately yet fulfilling public functions—present an innovative approach to park provision in high-density urban areas. However, systematic empirical evidence on their social value remains scarce. This study characterizes urban complex parks as a new form of green public space that provides key ecosystem services and proposes a three-dimensional evaluation framework integrating “usage vitality, place attractiveness, and user satisfaction.” Analyzing 19 park-equipped complexes among 75 cases in Shanghai using LBS data and online reviews through controlled linear regression and comparative analysis, our results indicate complexes with parks were associated with significantly outperforming others in place attractiveness and user satisfaction. Key findings include associations with a 413.7 m increase in average OD distance, a 3.4–4.0% higher city-level visitor share, and 5.24 percentage points greater median positive review rate. Crucially, spatial location outweighs green ratio and size in determining social value. Ground-level parks, through superior spatial integration, function as effective “social-ecological interfaces,” significantly outperforming rooftop parks in attracting long-distance visitors, stabilizing foot traffic (≈3% lower fluctuation), and enhancing per-store visitation. This demonstrates that green space quality (experiential quality and spatial configuration) matters more than quantity. Our findings suggest that urban complex parks can create social value through perceivable naturalness and restorative environments, providing an empirical basis for optimizing park city implementation in high-density contexts and highlighting the need to reconcile broad attractiveness with equitable local access.",

    "title": "An Equivalent and Unified Virtual Battery Modeling Framework for Flexibility Characterization of Building HVAC Systems",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.21363v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system dominates building's energy consumption and meanwhile exhibits substantial operational flexibility that can be exploited for providing grid services. However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost.",

    "content": "Restrictions on crop production in Ultisols are primarily driven by low soil fertility, which leads to the unsustainable use of soil resources and food insecurity. Significantly, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient availability for plants, which in turn contributes to greater soil productivity and supports sustainable crop production. This study aims to evaluate the effects of AMF inoculation combined with chemical fertilisation on maize growth and yield in three series of Ultisols. A pot experiment was performed with a 2 × 3 factorial CRD with five replications. Two factors were studied as follows: (1) AMF (Glomus sp.) (non-AMF and AMF inoculation) and (2) rates of chemical fertiliser (0, 50, and 100% of the recommended fertiliser rate for maize, CF). The results showed that AMF significantly enhanced the growth and yield of maize at all CF rates for all soil series at p ≤ 0.01. Total biomass and grain yield following AMF treatment were markedly higher than yields obtained without treatment. Likewise, AMF significantly improved the photosynthetic physiology and NPK content of maize. The CF rate had a negative impact on AMF root colonisation, and AMF efficiency also decreased as the CF rate increased. The relative mycorrhizal dependency (RMD) on maize growth and yield was the highest at 0% CF, with averages of 34.49% and 52.35%; however, these values decreased to 7.43% and 8.73% at 100% CF, respectively. Despite this, the RMD of maize growth and yield remained positive for all soil series. These findings suggest that AMF are an effective means of supporting sustainable maize cultivation in Ultisols.",

    "title": "Discovering Power Grid Dynamics from Data Using Low",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.05639v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced grid inertia, making modern power systems more vulnerable to instabilities. Accurate estimation of dynamic parameters such as inertia constants and damping coefficients is critical, yet traditional model-based methods struggle with scalability and adaptiveness in large, low-inertia networks. This paper presents a novel data-driven framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to estimate system parameters directly from time-series data. By reducing dimensionality before applying sparse regression, the proposed Latent-SINDy (L-SINDy) method mitigates overfitting while preserving essential system dynamics. The framework is validated on IEEE benchmark systems, including the 118-bus, 300-bus, and a large-scale 2869-bus European grid. The results demonstrate an accurate recovery of the inertia and damping values, with identified models that closely match the true dynamics of the system. The approach offers scalability, interpretability, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-time monitoring and control in renewable-rich grids.",

From AI and automation to digital platforms, the list keeps growing. Leaders make big investments, employees sit through onboarding sessions, and for a few weeks, excitement fills the air. Then the momentum fades. Dashboards sit idle. Pilots stall. The return on investment never arrives. We see it all the time. On the factory floor, operators are juggling a dozen tools that don’t talk to each other. Managers chase data that doesn’t reflect what’s really happening. Teams try to keep up with systems meant to help them but instead end up slowing them down. In moments like that, it’s clear that transformation isn’t just about technology—it’s about people. TRANSFORMATION STARTS WITH CLARITY Real transformation begins with clarity. A tool must serve a defined purpose, be anchored to measurable outcomes, and be designed around the people who use it. True impact happens when it’s tied to measurable business goals and shaped around the people who actually use it. Together as the CEO and the customer strategy lead of Squint, a manufacturing AI startup, we spend our days in our customers’ factories, walking the floor with production managers, maintenance crews, and line operators. We see firsthand how new systems can either make work smoother or create new friction. Over time, we’ve noticed a pattern: Too many teams start with the tool instead of the goal. They adopt technology because it looks impressive, not because they’ve defined what success should look like. Implementation should always begin with two simple questions: What problem are we solving? How will we know when we’ve solved it? At one food and beverage manufacturer we worked with, the operations team made a single smart decision. They tied their rollout to a company-wide goal of reducing downtime.

    "content": "arXiv:2410.06031v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Large-scale disasters, such as pandemics and climate-related events, test the resilience of healthcare systems, that is, their ability to ensure patient care under extreme strain. These crises intensify stress on the system, meaning sudden surges in demand for hospital beds, staff, and critical supplies, while increasing pressure on clinicians and other frontline providers. Most existing studies measure resilience using broad, system-wide outcomes, but often overlook how coordination between regions helps manage stress and keep care accessible. In this study, we analyzed billions of electronic medical records to construct cross-regional patient flow networks in the U.S., mapping how patients moved across healthcare facilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed that cross-regional flow rose to 4.59%, compared to the pre-pandemic level of 3.53%. This redistribution absorbed, on average, 63% of the excess stress on facilities, meaning nearly two-thirds of surging demand was handled by shifting patients to less burdened regions, an absolute 32 percentage point improvement from the pre-pandemic baseline of 31%. Further analysis suggests that strengthening cross-regional coordination could allow the healthcare system to absorb even more stress, reduce clinicians' demand, and reduce excess deaths. These findings show that structural strategies, like reinforcing patient flow between regions, can substantially enhance resilience, providing critical insights for future pandemic preparedness and disaster response planning, and ultimately improving patient care.",

Including by-products in ruminant diets can enhance food circularity and reduce competition for human food, while also increasing the likelihood of reducing methane (CH4) emissions. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of fully replacing corn grain and urea in the control diet with local by-products, specifically corn distillers’ grains combined with either barley brewed grains or with wheat middlings, on enteric CH4 emissions and performance of sheep. Diets were balanced to be isoproteic and isoenergetic with 2.6 Mcal ME/kg of dry matter (DM) and 160 g crude protein/kg DM, respectively. Corn silage is the only source of forage in the diet, and the forage-to-concentrate ratio was maintained to 60:40 on a DM basis. Twelve Highlander female sheep of 35.9 ± 3.12 kg initial body weight (BW, mean ± standard deviation), were used in a Completely Randomized Block design, with four sheep per treatment and two measurement periods under the same treatment. Experiment lasted 60 d, 30 d acclimatization and 30 d measurements. Dry matter intake (DMI) was restricted to 2.5% of BW. Enteric CH4 emissions of individual sheep were quantified in respiration chambers over a 48 h period. Dietary treatments did not have a significant effect either on DMI or BW gain. The diet containing barley brewed grains significantly reduced total daily CH4 production by 22.3%, CH4 emissions per kg of DMI by 34% and energy loss as CH4 by 38% compared to the control diet. In conclusion, the agro-industrial by-products combinations evaluated in this study effectively replaced corn grain and urea without compromising feed intake or animal performance. Additionally, the diet containing barley brewed grains significantly reduced CH4 yield, and energy loss compared to the control diet.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22315v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.",

However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.",

Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism. We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn. Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.",

Yet, the environmental dimension of cybersecurity risk is rarely quantified. This paper examines the connection between cybersecurity and sustainability by comparing the environmental impact of cyber-induced power plant disruption with the life cycle emissions involved in deploying cybersecurity monitoring solutions. We present a quantitative scenario in which a cyberattack forces a temporary disconnection of a power generation unit from the grid, leading to additional CO2 emissions primarily from wasted fuel during the operational disruption and subsequent reconnection procedures. The resulting carbon footprint is then compared with the emissions associated with implementing a continuous monitoring system designed to prevent such incidents. The results demonstrate that the installation and operation of a continuous monitoring system has a negligible environmental impact (below 5 tCO2 over five years) compared to the emissions resulting from a single 12 h outage event (460–836 tCO2), even when considering only the direct fuel waste.

Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines Mining Minima sampling with quantum mechanically refined ligand partial charges, QM/MM interaction evaluation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-based electronic energy correction. This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery. The framework also provides a natural foundation for future integration with machine learning models to enable predictive, large-scale, and adaptive screening strategies.",

With GPU compute throughput growing rapidly, CPU-side launch latency of kernels is emerging as a bottleneck. CUDA Graphs promise to address this by replaying a set of kernels with a single dispatch of the graph, removing per-kernel launch costs. However, CUDA Graphs remain surprisingly difficult to deploy correctly and efficiently. We present PyGraph - a compiler framework to maximize the coverage and benefits of CUDA Graphs for ML workloads. It introduces three novel optimizations: it applies automatic code transformations to make ML applications amenable to CUDA Graphs; it eliminates the parameter copy overheads for kernels executing in CUDA Graphs, and it selectively deploys CUDA Graphs guided by a cost-benefit analysis. For 25 ML workloads from TorchBench, HuggingFace, and TIMM, PyGraph more than doubles the benefit from deploying CUDA Graph compared to the most popular and widely used ML compiler, PyTorch2. PyGraph is built atop PyTorch2's compilation framework and requires no programmer intervention.",

    "title": "RAMBO: Resolving Amplicons in Mixed Samples for Accurate DNA Barcoding with Oxford Nanopore",
    "content": "DNA barcoding, the use of short genetic markers to identify and differentiate species, is a foundational tool in ecological and taxonomic research. The method has scaled rapidly with next-generation sequencing technologies, enabling the processing of thousands of specimens in parallel. Nanopore sequencing offers a flexible, low-cost alternative to other platforms, producing full-length reads in real time and supporting applications in remote settings. However, its comparatively high error rate complicates downstream processing, particularly when PCR co-amplifies multiple templates from a single specimen, reflecting pseudogenes, paralogs, or contaminants. We present a novel pipeline for DNA barcoding that resolves mixed sequence signals from Nanopore reads using unsupervised clustering and staged consensus generation, without relying on curated reference databases, taxonomic priors, or error models. Unlike existing approaches to curate Nanopore sequence data that assume a single dominant amplicon per sample or require large sequence divergence among amplicons, our method distinguishes variants differing by 0.15 percent. It combines column-weighted encodings, UMAP projection, and HDBSCAN clustering, followed by conservative consensus refinement. The pipeline was benchmarked and validated using datasets with known composition, including high-fidelity PacBio sequences. The results show that Nanopore barcoding, when paired with appropriate analysis tools, can recover biologically meaningful variation even in technically complex samples. The pipeline is particularly suited for specimens where divergent templates are often co-amplified, including mitochondrial pseudogenes or multicopy nuclear regions like ITS. As such, it provides a generalizable framework for high-resolution Nanopore analysis of complex amplicon data.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.09118v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present an efficient hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method (NN-FEM) for solving the viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice model. The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution.",

    "content": "In the context of intensifying global efforts to mitigate climate change, methane emissions from the oil and gas sector have emerged as a critical environmental and regulatory challenge, given methane’s high global warming potential over short timeframes. This study investigates methane emissions from representative extraction and production of oil and gas facilities in Romania, focusing on fugitive emissions from wells and associated processing infrastructure. The research is grounded in the implementation of a comprehensive Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program, aligned with OGMP 2.0 standards, and utilizes advanced detection technologies such as Flame Ionization Detectors (FID), Optical Gas Imaging (OGI), and Quantitative Optical Gas Imaging (QOGI). A systematic inventory and screening of thousands of components enabled the precise identification and quantification of methane leaks, providing actionable data for maintenance and emissions management. The findings highlight that, although the proportion of leaking components is relatively low, cumulative emissions are significant, with block valves, connectors, and compressor shaft seals identified as the most frequent sources of major leaks. The study underscores the importance of rigorous preventive and corrective maintenance, rapid leak remediation, and the adoption of modern detection and continuous monitoring technologies. The approach developed offers a robust framework for regulatory compliance and supports the transition from inventory-based to measurement-based emissions reporting, in line with recent European regulations. Ultimately, effective methane management not only fulfills environmental obligations but also delivers economic benefits by reducing product losses and enhancing operational efficiency, contributing to the decarbonization and sustainability objectives of the energy sector.",

We use the posterior approximation via Morph as the importance distribution in optimal bridge sampling. We denote this procedure by MorphZ, which serves as a post-processing estimator of the marginal likelihood. The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates. Because MorphZ operates directly on posterior draws, it complements exploration-oriented samplers by enabling fast and reliable evidence estimation, while it can be seamlessly integrated into existing inference workflows.",

These limitations restrict its applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-driven framework for multimodal human action recognition, utilizing event camera and skeleton data. Our framework is centered on two key innovations: (1) a novel multimodal SNN architecture that employs distinct backbone networks for each modality-an SNN-based Mamba for event camera data and a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (SGN) for skeleton data-combined with a spiking semantic extraction module to capture deep semantic representations; and (2) a pioneering SNN-based discretized information bottleneck mechanism for modality fusion, which effectively balances the preservation of modality-specific semantics with efficient information compression. To validate our approach, we propose a novel method for constructing a multimodal dataset that integrates event camera and skeleton data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both recognition accuracy and energy efficiency, offering a promising solution for practical applications.",

    "content": "Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States, with rural populations facing disproportionate delays in diagnosis due to geographic isolation, workforce shortages, and limited access to dermatologic care. These delays contribute to higher rates of late-stage diagnosis and poorer outcomes. Teledermatology has emerged as a promising solution to expand access to dermatologic evaluation and treatment in underserved settings. The review aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance, implementation challenges, and equity considerations of teledermatology in the context of rural skin cancer care, and to assess its potential to improve clinical outcomes in underserved populations. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify studies published between January 2015 and March 2025. Search terms included \"teledermatology,\" \"skin cancer,\" \"rural health services,\" \"telemedicine,\" \"diagnostic accuracy,\" and \"health disparities.\" Studies evaluating diagnostic metrics, time to diagnosis, patient satisfaction, and implementation barriers were included. Nine key studies spanning various countries and health care settings were included. Diagnostic sensitivity ranged from 41.9% to 100%, and specificity from 46% to 90%, depending on modality and lesion type. Teledermatology consistently reduced time to diagnosis, in some cases by over 75%, and was associated with high patient satisfaction due to increased convenience and reduced travel. Key barriers included technological limitations, inconsistent imaging protocols, and reimbursement variability. Successful implementation was facilitated by standardized workflows, dermoscopy integration, and centralized platforms.

However, existing resource management approaches remain largely reactive and cluster-centric, limiting their ability to optimize system-wide behavior under dynamic workloads. These limitations result in inefficient resource utilization, delayed adaptation, and increased operational overhead across distributed environments. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for adaptive resource optimization in multi-cluster cloud systems. The proposed approach integrates predictive learning, policy-aware decision-making, and continuous feedback to enable proactive and coordinated resource management across clusters. By analyzing cross-cluster telemetry and historical execution patterns, the framework dynamically adjusts resource allocation to balance performance, cost, and reliability objectives. A prototype implementation demonstrates improved resource efficiency, faster stabilization during workload fluctuations, and reduced performance variability compared to conventional reactive approaches. The results highlight the effectiveness of intelligent, self-adaptive infrastructure management as a key enabler for scalable and resilient cloud platforms.",

However, the growing heterogeneity of GPU clusters and limited visibility into application characteristics pose major challenges for existing schedulers, which often rely on offline profiling or application-specific assumptions. We present RLTune, an application-agnostic reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling framework that dynamically prioritizes and allocates DL jobs on heterogeneous GPU clusters. RLTune integrates RL-driven prioritization with MILP-based job-to-node mapping to optimize system-wide objectives such as job completion time (JCT), queueing delay, and resource utilization. Trained on large-scale production traces from Microsoft Philly, Helios, and Alibaba, RLTune improves GPU utilization by up to 20%, reduces queueing delay by up to 81%, and shortens JCT by as much as 70 percent. Unlike prior approaches, RLTune generalizes across diverse workloads without requiring per-job profiling, making it practical for cloud providers to deploy at scale for more efficient, fair, and sustainable DL workload management.",

    "title": "Weak Mileage Rules Put U.S. On The Road To An Automotive Jurassic Park",
    "content": "Current Climate brings you the latest news about the business of sustainability every Monday. Sign up to get it in your inbox.\nThe Trump administration’s plan to weaken U.S. fuel economy rules, claiming it will make new cars about $1,000 cheaper for consumers – presumably because automakers can use less sophisticated powertrains – ignores a simple fact: fuel-efficient hybrids, plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles cost a lot less to operate. It also won’t slow emissions of carbon dioxide from the transportation sector, the single biggest source of U.S. greenhouse emissions.\nCertainly, the move benefits U.S.-based automakers that specialize in big, fuel-thirsty pickups and SUVs that are among the market’s top sellers and make those companies the most money. But it promises to widen the gap between the U.S. auto market and the rest of the world, which is rapidly switching to electric vehicles, especially those made by Chinese brands. Like Cuba in the Castro era, where classic 1950s land yachts stayed in use long after they’d vanished elsewhere, the lax Trump rules could turn the U.S. into a kind of automotive Jurassic Park, dominated by gargantuan vehicles not found in other markets. Transportation Secretary even advocates turning the clock back to an era before strict MPG regulations. “This rule will actually allow you to bring back the 1970s station wagon — maybe a little wood paneling on the side,\" he told CNBC.\n(Oddly, Trump also expressed admiration for Japan’s tiny, cute kei cars, claiming he authorized Duffy to let them be built in the U.S. The problem is they don’t comply with U.S. crash safety guidelines.)\n“Globally, Europe, China, and other major markets continue to move forward with tighter efficiency rules and accelerated EV adoption,” said Jessica Caldwell, chief analyst for auto researcher Edmunds. “As U.S. standards shift, the domestic market may develop differently than other regions, which could influence the pace at which newer technologies or vehicl",

    "content": "Local heritability estimation is essential for analysing the genetic architecture of complex traits. Although the contemporary HEELS method, by using GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrices, achieves accuracy comparable to the gold-standard GREML method (Genomic Restricted Maximum Likelihood), its computational complexity makes the analysis of extended genomic regions (spanning tens of thousands of SNPs) a practically intractable task. We present FastHer, a maximum-likelihood-based method that, like HEELS, retains GREML-level accuracy while overcoming its computational limitations. The key innovation lies in an analytical reformulation of the likelihood function using a single eigen-decomposition of the LD matrix, yielding orders-of-magnitude acceleration. In benchmarks, FastHer demonstrated an approximately 100-fold speedup when analysing genomic regions containing ~10,000 SNPs. FastHer thus enables highly accurate and rapid local heritability analysis for extended genomic regions typical of biobank-scale data, making genome-wide studies computationally tractable. The method is implemented as an open-source R package.",

    "content": "The environmental persistence and carcinogenicity of catechol (CC) necessitate sensitive, portable detection methods beyond complex instrumentation. This work addresses this challenge by developing a novel metal-free fluorescent nanozyme, boron and nitrogen co-doped carbonized polymer dots (B,N-CPDs), via a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis using peach gum polysaccharide and 3-aminophenylboronic acid. Heteroatom co-doping optimizes electronic properties, enhancing both catalytic reactivity and specific recognition via electron-withdrawing phenylboronic acid moieties. The B,N-CPDs integrate intrinsic fluorescence with metal-independent peroxidase-like activity, enabling dual-modal (fluorescence/colorimetric) detection of CC without external substrates or labels. The fluorescence mode is exceptionally sensitive, with a detection limit of 0.25 nM across a wide linear range (0-72 μM). When coupled with smartphone-based analysis, the system achieves rapid, on-site dual-signal readout with low detection limits of 2.18 μM (fluorescence) and 4.5 μM (colorimetric), which surpass the performance of many existing techniques for CC detection. The platform demonstrates exceptional selectivity against interferents and high accuracy in environmental water samples (tap, lake, river, waste), with spike recoveries of 97.74-104.19% (RSD < 3.32%).

    "content": "Sustainable management of sediment-laden rivers is essential for balancing flood control, ecological protection, and socioeconomic development. The Upper Yellow River, supporting 160 million people, faces escalating challenges in maintaining channel stability under intensified water–sediment imbalances. This study investigates the Sipaikou reach in Ningxia—a representative wandering channel with multiple mid-channel shoals—through integrated UAV-USV-GNSS RTK field measurements and hydrodynamic and sediment transport modeling. Field measurements reveal that mid-channel shoal morphology coupled with bend circulation governs flow division patterns, with discharge ratios of 44.16% and 86.31% at the primary and secondary shoals, respectively. Gaussian kernel density estimation demonstrates velocity distributions evolving from right-skewed to left-skewed around shoals, while spur dike regions display strong left skewness with concentrated main flow. Numerical simulations under six discharge scenarios indicate: (1) Head loss exhibits diminishing marginal effects at the primary shoal, an inflection point at a critical discharge at the secondary shoal, and superlinear growth in the spur dike region. (2) The normal-flow period represents the critical threshold for erosion–deposition regime transition. (3) Spur dike series achieve bank protection through main flow constriction and inter-dike low-velocity zone creation. These findings provide scientific foundations for sustainable flood risk management and ecological restoration in wandering rivers. The integrated measurement–simulation framework offers a transferable methodology for adaptive river management under changing hydrological conditions.",

    "content": "Accurate monitoring of shaft voltages and bearing currents in large turbo-generators is essential for promoting the sustainable operation of critical power infrastructure. Conventional monitoring systems often rely on threshold triggers that fail to identify early-stage degradation in shaft-earthing brushes. This paper presents an advanced diagnostic approach based on real-time shaft voltage and current measurements collected from four large utility-scale steam turbine generators. Through detailed analysis of time-domain waveforms, frequency-domain spectra, and current scatter plots, characteristic electrical signatures were established for four operational case studies for faults: (i) a floating voltage brush, (ii) a floating current brush, (iii) a worn brush, and (iv) oil/dust contamination. This study demonstrates that each fault produces a distinctive pattern, such as the suppressed RMS shaft voltage with transient spikes in floating voltage brushes, elevated DC offsets and even-order harmonics in floating current brushes, erratic waveforms and intermittent surges in worn brushes, and elevated DC bias with increased current under contamination. These findings establish actionable thresholds for predictive maintenance, fostering enhanced reliability, optimized asset life, and reduced maintenance-related environmental impact.",

    "content": "arXiv:2508.06831v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras), considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts (SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.",

    "title": "EnScale: Temporally",
    "content": "arXiv:2509.26258v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.13710v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide, posing serious risks to ecosystems, infrastructure, and human livelihoods. This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.04369v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.",

    "content": "Community health workers are crucial to public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries. Despite their contributions to improving health, they encounter numerous barriers in performing their day-to-day work. Artificial intelligence applications may offer a potential solution to some of these barriers. We examined the implementation of smartphone-based artificial intelligence interventions with community health workers in Uganda, Rwanda, and Nigeria, including how the interventions were developed, how they were used, and successes and challenges of their implementation. This research identified four key considerations for intervention developers, implementing partners, and governments, with respect to implementation of these applications, including: 1) empowering community health workers through professionalization, compensation, and training; 2) understanding the digital ecosystem and aligning with digitization efforts; 3) designing the solution to fit local context, ensuring the development and training of the intervention is applicable to the local environment; and, 4) managing data responsibly with adherence to data privacy and security regulations. This research describes the opportunities for filling gaps in supervisory support, improving diagnosis, and making work more efficient. Providing the community health workforce with digital tools replaces onerous, inefficient paper-based record keeping, enables opportunities for improved supervision, and facilitates decision-making in settings where these workers may be the only point of access to health services and information.",

Batching is critical for speed; it can increase generation speed by up to 200x, as demonstrated in a previous repository: ysharma3501/FastNeuTTS. Low Sampling Rates: Most models operate at low sampling rates, often 24khz or 16khz. In contrast, industry standards like ElevenLabs use the standard audio sampling rate of 44.1khz, which results in much clearer audio quality. Poor Scaling: If you need to generate a several-hours-long audiobook or serve hundreds of users simultaneously, most modern models are horrendously slow at these large-scale tasks. ‚ú® LayaCodec: The Solution LayaCodec is a breakthrough for next-generation audio/TTS models. It addresses these issues by: Compressing audio far more, a single second of audio is represented in just 12.5 tokens per second or 25 tokens per second or 50 tokens per second depending on your preference in fidelity.

    "content": "arXiv:2510.11043v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Operating at petabit-scale, ByteDance's cloud gateways are deployed at critical aggregation points to orchestrate a wide array of business traffic. However, this massive scale imposes significant resource pressure on our previous-generation cloud gateways, rendering them unsustainable in the face of ever-growing cloud-network traffic. As the DPU market rapidly expands, we see a promising path to meet our escalating business traffic demands by integrating DPUs with our established Tofino-based gateways. DPUs augment these gateways with substantially larger table capacities and richer programmability without compromising previously low-latency and high-throughput forwarding. Despite compelling advantages, the practical integration of DPUs into cloud gateways remains unexplored, primarily due to underlying challenges. In this paper, we present Zephyrus, a production-scale gateway built upon a unified P4 pipeline spanning high-performance Tofino and feature-rich DPUs, which successfully overcomes these challenges. We further introduce a hierarchical co-offloading architecture (HLCO) to orchestrate traffic flow within this heterogeneous gateway, achieving > 99% hardware offloading while retaining software fallback paths for complex operations. Zephyrus outperforms LuoShen (NSDI '24) with 33% higher throughput and our evaluation further indicates 21% lower power consumption and 14% lower hardware cost. Against FPGA-based systems, Albatross (SIGCOMM '25), it doubles the throughput at a substantially lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), showcasing its superior performance-per-dollar. Beyond these performance gains, we also share key lessons from several years of developing and operating Zephyrus at production scale. We believe these insights provide valuable references for researchers and practitioners designing performant cloud gateways.",

However, LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly aims to reconstruct the original input within a reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when the projection is frozen.

Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, built upon Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures and trained on massive amounts of data, have progressively reduced transcription errors on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance in real-world production environments, particularly for non-English content like long-form Italian videos, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity.

And their timely action has aided in taming nature's fury. Women preparing the nursery bags. “The plantation is done between October and January. Each volunteer devotes around two hours a day to plant almost 200-250 saplings,” says Kalpana Sardar (45), an eco-warrior who has planted thousands of mangrove saplings ever since she joined JSB in 2021. Along with more than 200 JSB members spread across 23 villages, Sardar has planted lakhs of mangrove saplings so far under the guidance of Akul Biswas, a visually-challenged person. “We have been able to tame the bonna (flood) and the destruction from the cyclones only because of this practice,” explains Sardar, a mother of two. The mangroves act as a natural barrier against flooding and waves during the cyclones. The river embankments are protected as their roots hold the earth in place and prevent landslides. Having noticed that places in the Sundarbans with less vegetation bore the brunt of the cyclonic winds, it was Biswas who motivated the locals to plant mangroves. A decade-and-a-half later, this movement has led to the rise of eco-warriors who are mostly the locals. Here’s their story. A JSB volunteer tending to a mangrove sapling.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.21710v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.",

The results show that pyrolysis optimized material properties, especially SS biochar (SSB), which exhibited high stability with the highest fixed C content (13.6%) and thermostable fraction (TSF) of 43%. On the other hand, ZB had a higher pH and a lower EC than SS. Co-pyrolysis promoted complementary effects on the chemical and C stability properties of the SS + ZBBC combination. The combination raised the pH to a value close to neutrality (6.5), indicating potential corrective action for acidic soils. Furthermore, after co-pyrolysis, the TSF remained high (25.2%) and was classified as a high-longevity material (>1000 years), indicating high aromaticity and C condensation. Therefore, the co-pyrolysis of SS and ZB optimized the individual characteristics of the materials, thereby providing a promising and sustainable alternative for agro-environmental use that addresses the need to reduce C emissions and promote waste recycling.",

    "content": "Menstrual cups are increasingly used for menstrual hygiene. However, their use may alter the vaginal microenvironment and increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections caused by Staphylococcus spp. and Candida albicans. The current study aimed to develop an antimicrobial menstrual cup by incorporating silicone with Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (RT) leaf extract, a medicinal plant recognized for its antimicrobial properties. RT-loaded silicone was fabricated using an internal mixer and compression molding at 160 °C for 3 min. Surface roughness and wettability remained unchanged after incorporation. RT-loaded silicone exhibited pronounced anti-planktonic growth and antimicrobial adhesion against single- and dual-species cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and C. albicans. The loaded silicone significantly inhibited bacterial growth as early as 1 h after incubation (p < 0.05), with a reduction of > 5 log CFU/mL of pathogens after 12 h. Similar inhibitory activity was observed in experiments conducted in simulated vaginal fluid. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the strong antimicrobial properties of the RT-loaded material. No cytotoxic effects were detected on fibroblast cells. Importantly, the antimicrobial activity was retained after 12 boiling cycles, indicating good stability. These findings demonstrate the potential of RT-loaded silicone as a promising material for developing safer menstrual cups with enhanced antimicrobial protection.",

    "content": "Accurate precipitation forecasting is essential for hydrometeorological risk management, especially for anticipating extreme rainfall that can lead to flash flooding and infrastructure damage. This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making. This work advances DL-based precipitation forecasting by enhancing predictive skill, reliability, and applicability across regions.",

We focus on the recycling of paper cups, though the proposed methodology applies more broadly to reverse logistics systems arising in circular economy R-strategies. Each item is assumed to carry a digital wallet through which monetary rewards are allocated to actors transferring the item across successive stages, incentivising completion of the recycling process. System efficiency is ensured by: (i) decentralised algorithms that avoid congestion at individual nodes; (ii) a decentralised AIMD-based algorithm that optimally splits the deposit across layers; and (iii) a feedback control loop that dynamically adjusts the deposit to achieve a desired throughput. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulations using realistic paper cup recycling data.",

    "content": "Data is the fuel of modern business, but relying on older CPU-based Apache Spark pipelines introduces a heavy toll. They’re inherently slow, require large infrastructure, and lead to massive cloud expenditure. As a result, GPU-accelerated Spark is becoming a leading solution, providing lightning-fast performance using parallel processing. This improved efficiency reduces cloud bills and saves valuable development hours.\nBuilding on this foundation, we introduce a smart and efficient way to migrate existing CPU-based Spark workloads running on Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR). Project Aether is an NVIDIA tool engineered to automate this transition. It works by taking existing CPU jobs and optimizing them to run on GPU-accelerated EMR using the RAPIDS Accelerator for performance benefits.\nProject Aether is a suite of microservices and processes designed to automate migration and optimization for the RAPIDS Accelerator, effectively eliminating manual friction. This aims to reduce migration time from CPU to GPU Spark Jobs through:\n- A prediction model for potential GPU speedup using recommended bootstrap configurations.\n- Out-of-the-box testing and tuning of GPU jobs in a sandbox environment.\n- Smart optimization for cost and runtime.\n- Full integration with Amazon EMR supported workloads.\nNow supporting the Amazon EMR platform, Project Aether automates the management of GPU test clusters and the conversion and optimization of Spark steps. Users can use the services provided to migrate existing EMR CPU Spark workloads to GPUs.\nTo get started, you’ll need to meet the following prerequisites.\n- Amazon EMR on EC2: AWS account with GPU instance quotas\n- AWS CLI: Configured with aws configure\n- Aether NGC: Request access, configure credentials with ngc config set, and follow Aether installation instructions.\nOnce the Aether package is installed, configure the Aether client for the EMR platform using the following commands:\n# Initialize and list config\n$ aether config init\n$ ae",

    "content": "Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems are essential for large enterprises to monitor their IT infrastructure by ingesting and analyzing millions of logs and events daily. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models.",

This study aims to develop and validate a unified framework that maintains diagnostic accuracy while dynamically adapting medical report complexity to diverse literacy levels, and to establish comprehensive evaluation methodologies for patient-centered medical documentation. We developed a unified framework integrating three innovations: a hybrid detection method combining CheXFusion and Eigen-CAM for clinical finding detection and anatomical localization; an advanced LLaVA-based pipeline synthesizing clinical predictions with anatomical data for contextually rich medical reports; and a self-reflective large language model system dynamically adapting report complexity across reading levels (6th, 11th, and 18th-grade) while preserving clinical integrity.

    "content": "After Joey Zwillinger stepped down as CEO of Allbirds in March 2024, he took three months off—mainly because his wife Liz said she’d divorce him if he jumped into another venture. He had run the sustainable shoe company for 10 years while the couple raised their three young children. “It took a real toll on the family,” Liz says. (“I would say it developed character in our family,” Zwillinger counters.) Before long, he was itching to start a new project, an ambition he shyly expressed to his wife. “It was really hard to want to sign up for something like that all over again,” Liz says. But this time, he cofounded the venture with Liz. Joey & Liz Zwillinger [Photo: Biologica] It’s also a bold pivot from a sustainable shoe company to an entirely different industry: women’s hormone health supplements. At a time when health and wellness is big business, it might also be a smart pivot. But it’s an undeniably different world, navigating health regulations and making bold investment choices when such bets didn’t go so well at Allbirds. Revenue and share prices dipped drastically starting in 2022, and have hardly recovered. Launching December 9, Biologica is a set of new supplements for women’s health, naturally flavored and powdered to fizz into water. Each single sachet, or separately sealed daily dose to be mixed with eight ounces of water, targets different body functions with ingredients including electrolytes, multivitamins, botanicals, and probiotics. Crucially to the value proposition, there are three products for different life stages: younger reproductive years, perimenopause, and post-menopause. While some share ingredients like Vitamin C and potassium, for different stages you may have dosages of broccoli extract (for detoxification and liver function), pomegranate extract (for skin hydration), or saffron (for mood balance and sleep quality).

    "content": "The precise identification of energy poor households is a critical step towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 1 (No Poverty), while also intersecting with climate action (SDG 13). As the world’s largest developing country, China faces unique energy poverty challenges characterized by significant regional disparities and uneven access to modern energy services. To support targeted interventions and equitable policy-making, this study proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for predicting and interpreting energy poverty. Utilizing nationally representative data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) from 2014 to 2020, we developed a predictive model that integrates a Convolutional Neural Network with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our model, EPPE-FCS, demonstrated exceptional predictive performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23%, outperforming several mainstream benchmarks. Crucially, the SHAP interpretability analysis revealed that annual per capita household expenditure is the most influential driver, while the contribution of energy burden indicators (electricity and gas expenses) exhibited a significant decreasing trend. This trend likely reflects the positive impact of China’s national policies, such as the “Clean Heating Initiative” and “Targeted Poverty Alleviation,” on improving energy infrastructure and affordability. The findings underscore the necessity of a dual-track policy that combines immediate energy cost subsidies with long-term strategies for income enhancement and clean energy transition. This research provides policymakers with a robust tool to alleviate energy poverty, thereby advancing a just, sustainable, and climate-resilient energy future in China and other developing regions.",

    "content": "Pharmaceuticals such as paracetamol and diclofenac (DCF) are among the most extensively consumed drugs worldwide and are continuously released into municipal and hospital wastewater due to incomplete human metabolism. Their persistent presence in aquatic environments, typically ranging from ng/L to µg/L, raises concerns due to endocrine disruption, chronic toxicity, and the promotion of antimicrobial resistance. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) remove 70–90% of ACT but less than 30% of DCF, primarily because these systems were not designed to target low-concentration, recalcitrant micropollutants. As a result, pharmaceuticals frequently pass into treated effluents, highlighting the need for advanced, sustainable, and passive treatment solutions. Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) have emerged as a promising technology for the interception and removal of pharmaceuticals from both wastewater treatment plant effluents and groundwater. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of ACT and DCF occurrence, environmental behavior, and ecotoxicological risks, followed by a detailed evaluation of PRB performance using advanced reactive media such as geopolymers, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and hybrid composites. Reported removal efficiencies exceed 90% for ACT and 70–95% for DCF, depending on media composition and operating conditions. The primary removal mechanisms include adsorption, ion exchange, π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and redox transformation. The novelty of this review lies in systematically synthesizing recent laboratory- and pilot-scale findings on PRBs for pharmaceutical removal, identifying critical knowledge gaps—including long-term field validation, media regeneration, and performance under realistic wastewater matrices—and outlining future research directions for scaling PRBs toward full-scale implementation. The study demonstrates that PRBs represent a viable and sustainable tertiary treatment option for reducing pharmac",

Die unlängst vom Oberlandesgericht München bestätigte Entscheidung macht deutlich, dass der Schutz von Leib und Leben im Zweifel schwerer wiegt als das individuelle Recht auf maximale Speicherkapazität.\nDer Fall liest sich wie ein Krimi der modernen Haustechnik: Ein Kunde erwarb im August 2021 für rund 17.200 Euro einen Akkumulator mit 7,5 kWh Kapazität.

    "content": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.",

Smugglers had adopted ‘go-fast boats’ or ‘cigarette boats,’ speedboats packed with fuel and drugs. Reaching speeds of 80 mph or more, the new fast boats easily outpaced the Coast Guard’s ships.\n“These guys were running right past our cutters and were waving as they went by,” Lt. Cmdr. Chris Adair, of the Coast Guard’s Office of Law Enforcement Policy told the Lexington Institute in a 2000 interview.\nThe response was to supply the Coast Guard with MH-90 Enforcer helicopters able to operate from the cutters, and arming the helicopters with M-240 machine guns and .50-caliber Robar sniper rifles. The machine guns were used for warning shots, kicking up lines of spray (\"stitches\") in front of a boat. If a boat failed to stop, a specially trained sniper used the .50 Cal to place shots into the outboard motor, bringing it to a halt.\nThis operation was so successful it was expanded to form the Coast Guard’s Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON), which continues to operate in the counter-drugs role. From one helicopter, HITRON now has eight , currently Augusta A109Es. In fiscal year 2024, HITRON stopped 34 vessels, detained 114 smugglers, and interdicted 52 tons of cocaine valued at nearly $1.4 billion.

On the other hand, to improve flexibility, applications are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs), where each function runs as a Virtual Network Function (VNF). While scalable, this approach is more failure-prone than monolithic deployments, necessitating intelligent redundancy and placement strategies. This paper addresses the reliability-aware SFC placement problem over heterogeneous fog servers through the lens of reliability theory. We explore four redundancy strategies, combining shared vs. dedicated and active vs. standby modes, and propose a general framework to minimize latency and cost while meeting reliability and deadline constraints. The problem is formulated as an Integer Non-Linear Program (INLP), and two genetic algorithm (GA)-based solutions are developed. Simulation results show that shared-standby redundancy outperforms the conventional dedicated-active approach by up to 84%.",

    "content": "Steel, a fundamental material in modern industry, is widely used across manufacturing, construction, and energy sectors. Steel surface defects exhibit characteristics such as multiple classes, multi-scale features, small detection targets, and low-contrast backgrounds, making detection difficult. We propose RAC-RTDETR, a lightweight real-time detection algorithm designed for accurately identifying small surface defects on steel. Key improvements include: (1) The ARNet network, combining the ADown module and the RepNCSPELAN4-CAA module with a CAA-based attention mechanism, results in a lighter backbone network with better feature extraction and enhanced small-object detection by integrating contextual information; (2) The novel AIFI-ASMD module, composed of Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA), Spatially Enhanced Feedforward Network (SEFN), Multi-Cognitive Visual Adapter (Mona), and Dynamic Tanh (DyT), optimizes feature interactions at different scales, reduces noise interference, and improves spatial awareness and long-range dependency modeling for better detection of multi-scale objects; (3) The Converse2D upsampling module replaces traditional upsampling methods, preserving details and enhancing small-object recognition in low-contrast, sparse feature scenarios. Experimental results on the NEU-DET and GC10-DET datasets show that RAC-RTDETR outperforms baseline models with MAP improvements of 3.56% and 3.47%, a 36.18% reduction in Parameters, a 40.70% decrease in GFLOPs, and a 7.96% increase in FPS.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.06809v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Battery safety is paramount for electric vehicles. Early fault diagnosis remains a challenge due to the subtle nature of anomalies and the interference of dynamic operating noise. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from \"physical blindness\" leading to missed detections or false alarms. To address this, we propose a Physics-Aware Attention LSTM Autoencoder (PA-ALSTM-AE). This novel framework explicitly integrates battery aging laws (mileage) into the deep learning pipeline through a multi-stage fusion mechanism. Specifically, an adaptive physical feature construction module selects mileage-sensitive features, and a physics-guided latent fusion module dynamically calibrates the memory cells of the LSTM based on the aging state. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Vloong real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, it improves the recall rate of early faults by over 3 times while maintaining high precision, offering a robust solution for industrial battery management systems.",

    "content": "Oil seals, as core industrial components, often exhibit defects with sparse features and low contrast, posing significant challenges for traditional vision-based inspection methods. Although deep learning facilitates automatic feature extraction for defect detection, many instance segmentation models are computationally expensive, hindering their deployment in real-time edge applications. In this paper, we present an efficient oil seal defect detection model based on an enhanced YOLOv11n architecture (YOLOv11n_CDK). The proposed approach introduces several dynamic convolution variants and integrates the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) into the backbone. A newly designed parallel module, the nested asynchronous pooling convolutional module (NAPConv), is also incorporated to form a lightweight yet powerful feature extraction network. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our model reduces computational cost by 4.76% and increases mAP@0.5 by 2.14%. When deployed on a Jetson Nano embedded device, the model achieves an average processing time of 6.3 ms per image, corresponding to a frame rate of 105–110 FPS. These outcomes highlight the model’s strong potential for high-performance, real-time industrial deployment, effectively balancing detection accuracy with low computational complexity.",

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, \"in-the-wild\" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation.

    "content": "This article was originally published on the NITI Frontier Tech Respository. DeHaat is an AI-driven, full-stack agricultural platform founded by IIT and IIM alumni in 2012 with an ambition to solve one of India’s most persistent structural challenges: the fragmentation and inefficiency of smallholder farming. Conceived initially as a research project on improving last-mile input delivery and crop advisory, the founders — Shashank Kumar and Manish Kumar — identified a critical gap in how farmers accessed seeds, fertilisers, credit, and market linkages. Traditional supply chains were long, information was fragmented, and farmers lacked timely, actionable agronomic guidance. DeHaat set out to address this by building a scalable digital ecosystem that integrates AI-enabled advisory, physical service centres, and organised market access into a single, seamless system tailored for India’s agrarian landscape. From a community experiment to a national agri-tech network In its early years, the DeHaat model was piloted in Bihar, Odisha, and eastern Uttar Pradesh. These regions, dominated by small and marginal farmers cultivating diverse crops, became the first testing ground for a platform that combined predictive advisory with doorstep service delivery. By 2019, DeHaat had grown to support nearly 65,000 farmers through a network of 168 micro-entrepreneurs who served as DeHaat franchisees. The early version of DeHaat focused heavily on farmer education and trust-building. Trained extension officers travelled to villages, demonstrating improved input packages while collecting crop-stage data that would eventually form the foundation of the platform’s machine learning models. By 2019, DeHaat had grown to support nearly 65,000 farmers through a network of 168 micro-entrepreneurs who served as DeHaat franchisees.

A naive implementation creates a new balance record per deposit, leading to unbounded storage growth and vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. We present time-bucketed balance records, a data structure that bounds storage to O(k) records per account while guaranteeing that tokens never expire before their configured TTL. Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity with measured gas costs demonstrating practical efficiency.",

    "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in transforming recommender systems from implicit behavioral pattern matching to explicit intent reasoning. While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards.\n  To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER. RecGPT-V2 establishes both the technical feasibility and commercial viability of deploying LLM-powered intent reasoning at scale, bridging the gap between cognitive exploration and industrial utility.",

    "content": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) must simultaneously satisfy stringent reliability, latency, and sustainability targets under highly dynamic urban and highway mobility. Existing solutions typically optimise one or two dimensions (link stability, clustering, or energy) but lack an integrated, adaptive mechanism that fuses heterogeneous metrics while remaining lightweight and deployable. This paper introduces a VANET routing protocol named SYMPHONY (Synergistic Hierarchical Metric-Fusion and Predictive Hybrid Optimization for Network Yield) that operates in three coordinated layers: (i) a compact neighbourhood filtering stage that reduces forwarding scope and eliminates transient relays, (ii) a cluster layer that elects resilient cluster heads using fuzzy energy-aware metrics and backup leadership, and (iii) a global inter-cluster optimizer that blends a GA-reseeded swarm metaheuristic with a stability-aware pheromone scheme to produce multi-objective routes. Crucially, SYMPHONY employs an ultra-lightweight online weight-adaptation module (contextual linear bandit) to tune metric fusion weights in response to observed rewards (packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and Green Performance Index). We evaluated the proposed routing protocol SYMPHONY versus strong modern baselines across urban and highway scenarios with varying density and resource constraints. The results demonstrate that SYMPHONY improves packet delivery ratio by up to 12–18%, reduces latency by 20–35%, and increases the Green Performance Index by 22–45% relative to the best baseline, while keeping control overhead and per-node computation within practical bounds.",

    "content": "Background: The continually increasing volume of sequence data results in a growing demand for fast implementations of core algorithms. Computation of pairwise alignments based on dynamic programming is an important part in many bioinformatics pipelines and a major contributor to overall runtime due to the associated quadratic time complexity. This motivates the need for a library of efficient implementations on modern GPUs for a variety of alignment algorithms for different types of sequence data including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Results: Accelign is a library of accelerated pairwise sequence alignment algo- rithms for CUDA-enabled GPUs. Its parallelization strategy is based on a common wavefront design that can be adapted to support a variety of dynamic programming algorithms: local, global, and semi-global alignment of genomic and protein sequences with a variety of commonly used scoring schemes supporting one-to-one, one-to-many or all-to-all pairwise sequence alignments. This leads to a peak performance between 16.1 TCUPS and 9.1 TCUPS for computing optimal global alignment scores with linear gaps and affine gap penalties on a single RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU, respectively. In addition, our library demonstrates sig- nificant speedups in several real-world case studies over prior CPU-based (SeqAn, Parasail, BSalign) and GPU-based libraries (ADEPT, GASAL2), and can even outperform highly customized algorithms (WFA-GPU, CUDASW++4.0). Fur- thermore, the performance of our approach scales linearly with the number of employed GPUs, which makes it feasible to exploit multi-GPU nodes for increased processing speeds. Conclusion: Accelign provides significant speedups for commonly used pairwise alignment algorithms compared to prior implementations. It is freely available at https://github.com/fkallen/Accelign.",

    "content": "We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.",

    "content": "The development of PET and positronium imaging techniques is strictly related to the availability of suitable radionuclides and robust radiochemistry platforms. Among the emerging candidates, $^{44}$Sc has attracted significant interest due to its favourable physical properties, including a half-life of $\\sim$4 hours, a pure $β^{+}$ emission profile, and the additional prompt $γ$-emission that enables advanced triple-photon detection schemes. These characteristics make $^{44}$Sc particularly promising for highresolution imaging and novel quantitative methodologies. However, routine clinical and preclinical implementation requires a practical, sustainable, and cost-efficient production route. In this context, we propose a titanium-scandium radionuclide generator as an optimal solution. This study focuses on optimising the synthesis of the long-lived parent isotope, $^{44}$Ti ($T_{1/2}$ = 59.1 years), from which $^{44}$Sc can be selectively eluted in a chemically pure form when needed. An analysis of various production pathways was conducted, including proton and deuteron reactions on scandium, as well as $α$-particle and lithium-induced reactions on calcium, to determine the most efficient reaction parameters, target design, and expected yield. Furthermore, we identify some existing cyclotron facilities suitable for implementing this technology. Results indicate that efficient $^{44}$Ti production is achievable using proton beams in the 20-30 MeV range under extended irradiation conditions. The proposed generator system would enable routine and decentralised $^{44}$Sc supply. Its integration with the novel J-PET scanner may significantly reduce diagnostic costs and improve access to advanced PET imaging in regions with limited medical imaging infrastructure.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.22178v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent, adaptive resource management in next-generation wireless networks has underscored the importance of accurate and scalable wireless traffic prediction. While recent advancements in deep learning and foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising forecasting capabilities, they largely overlook the spatial dependencies inherent in city-scale traffic dynamics. In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Our results indicate that integrating spatial awareness into LLM-based predictors is the key to unlocking scalable and intelligent network management in future 6G systems.",

Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.",

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not.

Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.",

Our findings identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens) suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks. Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems, enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.",

    "title": "Best of 2025: 10 Indian Innovations That Solved Real Problems in Homes, Hospitals & Villages",
    "content": "In a Bengaluru home, an app flags unseen electricity wastage.In a remote village, a health worker confirms a diagnosis without a lab nearby.In a factory floor, a worker finds relief from extreme heat. These moments did not make headlines on their own. Together, they defined innovation in India in 2025. As the year draws to a close, what stands out is intent. Across the country, innovators responded to everyday challenges with solutions rooted in lived realities. Their ideas moved beyond prototypes and presentations into homes, clinics, farms, factories, and public spaces. Here are 10 standout Indian innovations of 2025 that translated purpose into practical impact, improving lives across sectors and geographies. 1. Cutting power waste where it begins Bengaluru-based engineer Bharath Rnkawat began with a simple question inside his own home: where was electricity being wasted? Tracking appliance-level usage revealed losses most households never notice. That insight led to Enlog, a smart energy system that monitors consumption, flags inefficiencies, and regulates appliances in real time. Enlog specifically targets electricity inefficiencies with a real-time data-driven system that can autonomously regulate appliances and identify current leakages. Today, Enlog’s smart system automatically regulates appliances and flags wastage in real time. It has helped over 23,000 users cut electricity consumption by up to 23%, translating into lower bills, reduced emissions, and more mindful energy use across homes and workplaces. Read their full story here. 2. Taking accurate diagnostics beyond big labs Sriram Natarajan and Chandrasekhar Nair, founders of Kochi-based Molbio Diagnostics, set out to solve a critical gap in healthcare — making accurate disease testing accessible beyond well-equipped labs. The journey began when they saw how delayed and unreliable tuberculosis diagnosis was costing lives, especially in resource-poor settings. Molbio Diagnostics’ portable tools make acc",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.24117v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a \"temporal-first\" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the \"temporal-first\" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20469v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \\emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation. However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals. We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use. We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.",

Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.15031v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns. We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate \\textit{Summaries of Conversation Dynamics} (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the \\textit{likelihood of derailment}. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.",

    "content": "Day 17 was one of those days that really tested my patience but also deepened my understanding of real-world deployment strategies. Today, I learned about Blue-Green deployment, how Elastic Beanstalk fits into that strategy, and how to actually swap environments safely without downtime. It wasn’t smooth at all; IAM policies almost broke my spirit but the lesson stuck. What Blue-Green Deployment Really Is: Blue-Green deployment is a strategy where you maintain two identical environments: Blue → current production (stable). Green → new version (staging). Instead of deploying directly to production, you deploy the new version to the green environment, test it thoroughly, and then swap traffic instantly. If something goes wrong, rollback is just another swap away. This drastically reduces downtime and deployment risk something every serious production system needs. Why Elastic Beanstalk? Elastic Beanstalk abstracts a lot of infrastructure complexity while still giving control when needed. It manages: EC2 instances. Load balancers. Auto Scaling. Health checks. Application versions. For this demo, Elastic Beanstalk made Blue-Green deployment practical, especially when paired with Terraform for infrastructure consistency. Terraform Setup: Providers and IAM (Where the Pain Started) I started with provider configuration and IAM roles and this is where things got tough. Elastic Beanstalk requires multiple IAM roles, and incorrect attachments will break everything. terraform { required_providers { aws = { source = \"hashicorp/aws\" version = \"~>5.0\" } } required_version = \">= 1.0\" } provider \"aws\" { region = var.aws_region } The EC2 role for Elastic Beanstalk instances: resource \"aws_iam_role\" \"eb_ec2_role\" { name = \"${var.app_name}-eb-ec2-role\" assume_role_policy = jsonencode({ Version = \"2012-10-17\" Statement = [{ Action = \"sts:AssumeRole\" Effect = \"Allow\" Principal = { Service = \"ec2.amazonaws.com\" } }] }) } Attaching the correct managed policies was critical and yes, I hit m",

Sin embargo, una llamada telefónica cambió el orden de los factores y reveló la desesperación de la industria tecnológica. Al otro lado de la línea estaba Sam Altman. El mensaje del CEO de OpenAI fue una súplica directa: \"Por favor, por favor, por favor, consíguenos algo\". Altman no buscaba billetes de avión; buscaba potencia eléctrica. Esta anécdota, relatada al Financial Times, resume el estado de emergencia del sector: la inteligencia artificial avanza a una velocidad de vértigo, pero se ha chocado contra el muro de la infraestructura física. Mientras la IA evoluciona en meses, los permisos para conectarse a la red eléctrica pueden demorarse hasta diez años en algunas regiones. Ante esta parálisis, la industria ha optado por el \"Plan B\" que consiste en eludir la red y fabricar su propia energía in situ. El alto precio de la urgencia. Este giro estratégico tiene consecuencias profundas. La primera es económica, el \"atraso\" sale caro. Según analistas de BNP Paribas, la energía de una planta de gas construida para Meta en Ohio cuesta unos 175 dólares por megavatio hora, prácticamente el doble del coste medio para un cliente industrial. La segunda es ambiental. Mark Dyson, del Rocky Mountain Institute, advierte que las emisiones de estas plantas son mucho peores que las de la red general, que combina gas eficiente con renovables. Pese a ello, la urgencia es tal que las autoridades están cediendo. En Virginia, el corazón mundial de los centros de datos, se está considerando flexibilizar las normas de emisiones para permitir que los generadores operen con mayor frecuencia.

    "content": "The tiny Fiat Topolino—about the length of a cargo bike and half as long as an American SUV or pickup—is the kind of car tourists stop to photograph as a cute curiosity in Rome or Milan. The electric car only travels 28 miles an hour, and it’s designed for dense European cities. But it also only costs around $10,000, and Fiat is now betting that Americans are ready for something this tiny. The company recently announced plans to bring the car to the U.S., shortly after Trump said that he wanted to help bring similarly tiny kei cars to the U.S. from Japan. There’s a strong argument that smaller cars are better for society: They’re more affordable, more efficient, take up less space, and they’re safer for pedestrians and other vehicles in a crash. (Uncharacteristically, Trump noted that “really cute” kei cars can be electric and are fuel efficient, shortly after his administration started the process to roll back fuel efficiency requirements.) But for the smallest microcars to be more than a niche category, a lot would have to change. Growing interest in smaller rides For years, the conventional wisdom has been that Americans love giant vehicles. Ford F-Series trucks have long been the bestselling vehicles; SUVs are more popular than cars. But size preferences are slowly starting to shrink. Compact SUVs now outsell larger SUVs. Sales of midsized trucks are growing faster than full-sized trucks. Compact car sales are also growing. Automakers push bigger vehicles because they make more money on them, partly because of loophole in fuel efficiency regulations. But as consumer cost concerns grow, buyers are moving in the other direction. “I think that it’s certainly not baked into our DNA to like big cars,” says Ben Crowther, policy director at America Walks, an organization that advocates for smaller vehicles to make streets safer for pedestrians and others on the road. “It’s the result of several decades’ worth of marketing.

In 2017, part of it collapsed, killing two people and releasing toxic fumes into the air. For most residents, it was another grim headline. For Vihaan and Nav Agarwal, it became a turning point. Still in school, the brothers realised that nearly 33% of Delhi’s air pollution came from burning mixed waste. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Better India (@thebetterindia) For Vihaan, who was already battling severe asthma attacks, the truth hit hard. The air he breathed, the waste he saw piling up, and the landfill fires were deeply connected. So, they decided to act. Their first step was simple — segregating waste at home. They began at home, carefully separating dry waste from wet. When recyclers refused to collect small quantities, the brothers reached out to neighbours, persuading 15 families to segregate waste. What started as a household habit soon turned into a neighbourhood movement. Two schoolboys and a simple solution In 2018, at just 14 and 11 years old, Vihaan and Nav launched ‘OneStepGreener’, a youth-led initiative offering free door-to-door dry waste collection for homes, schools, and offices. Plastic, cardboard, metal, glass, and e-waste were sorted and sent for responsible recycling — ensuring they never reached landfills or incinerators. However, like every startup, the early days were tough. Rejections were frequent. Resources were scarce. Their first collections were done using a borrowed truck. But persistence paid off. Today, OneStepGreener offers free waste-pickups across 14 cities, having recycled over one million kilograms of waste — waste that would otherwise have been burned or dumped. The initiative has also helped plant more than 73,000 trees and created livelihood opportunities for hundreds of women, turning waste management into dignified work.

Central to nncase is an e-graph-based term rewriting engine that mitigates the phase ordering problem, enabling global exploration of computation and data movement strategies. The framework integrates three key modules: Auto Vectorize for adapting to heterogeneous computing units, Auto Distribution for searching parallel strategies with cost-aware communication optimization, and Auto Schedule for maximizing on-chip cache locality. Furthermore, a buffer-aware Codegen phase ensures efficient kernel instantiation. Evaluations show that nncase outperforms mainstream frameworks like MLC LLM and Intel IPEX on Qwen3 series models and achieves performance comparable to the hand-optimized llama.cpp on CPUs, demonstrating the viability of automated compilation for high-performance LLM deployment.

    "content": "The steep reduction in the cost of genome sequencing started with the introduction of Solexa Sequencing-By-Synthesis technology in 2006 has plateaued recently due to technical limitations in the use of closed flowcells and to the cost of reagents. The Ultima Genomics UG 100 is the first sequencing machine to lower the cost of human genome sequencing to 80$. However, technical limitations in resolving long homopolymer regions undermine the application of this technology to short variant calling in clinical settings. Here, we evaluate the ability of UG 100 to identify short variants in relation to its suitability for clinical accreditation, by comparing it with the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Systems platform. We focus specifically on the small variant calling performance in long homopolymer regions, both genome-wide and in relation to a set of medically-relevant genes that are challenging to sequence. Our analysis aims at supporting clinicians in determining whether the UG 100 platform is well-suited for their studies, and to guide clinical sequencing centers in evaluating the adoption of this emerging technology.",

    "content": "This is a sponsored article brought to you by The University of Sheffield.Across global electricity networks, the shift to renewable energy has fundamentally changed the behavior of power systems. Decades of engineering assumptions, predictable inertia, dispatchable baseload generation, and slow, well-characterized system dynamics, are now eroding as wind and solar become dominant sources of electricity. Grid operators face increasingly steep ramp events, larger frequency excursions, faster transients, and prolonged periods where fossil generation is minimal or absent.In this environment, battery energy storage systems (BESS) have emerged as essential tools for maintaining stability. They can respond in milliseconds, deliver precise power control, and operate flexibly across a range of services. But unlike conventional generation, batteries are sensitive to operational history, thermal environment, state of charge window, system architecture, and degradation mechanisms. Their long-term behavior cannot be described by a single model or simple efficiency curve, it is the product of complex electrochemical, thermal, and control interactions.Most laboratory tests and simulations attempt to capture these effects, but they rarely reproduce the operational irregularities of the grid. Batteries in real markets are exposed to rapid fluctuations in power demand, partial state of charge cycling, fast recovery intervals, high-rate events, and unpredictable disturbances. As Professor Dan Gladwin, who leads Sheffield’s research into grid-connected energy storage, puts it, “you only understand how storage behaves when you expose it to the conditions it actually sees on the grid.”This disconnect creates a fundamental challenge for the industry: How can we trust degradation models, lifetime predictions, and operational strategies if they have never been validated against genuine grid behavior?Few research institutions have access to the infrastructure needed to answer that question.",

El resultado: las Navidades más luminosas y extensas que se recuerdan en la localidad castellanomanchega. Un porcentaje: 94,25%. La apuesta parece haberle salido bien al Consistorio, que hace unos días sacaba pecho por la marea de turistas que recibió durante el puente de la Constitución y la Inmaculada.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.09780v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.18522v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Drought is a complex natural hazard that affects ecological and human systems, often resulting in substantial environmental and economic losses. Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.10671v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.",

In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the \\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\\times$ speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.",

Mechanical weeding is inefficient over large fields, and herbicides harm the soil ecosystem. Laser weeding with mobile robots has emerged as a sustainable alternative in precision farming. In this paper, we present an autonomous weeding robot that uses controlled exposure to a low energy laser beam for weed removal. The proposed robot is six-wheeled with a novel double four-bar suspension for higher stability. The laser is guided towards the detected weeds by a three-dimensional linear actuation mechanism.

At an optimal speed of 42.5 cm/s, the robot achieves a weed detection rate of 86.2\\% and operating time of 87 seconds per meter. The laser actuation mechanism maintains a minimal mean positional error of 1.54 mm, combined with a high hit rate of 97\\%, ensuring effective and accurate weed removal.

Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy have dedicated pages on their websites for pre-owned devices.

Recent innovations are transforming hydraulic technology to improve energy efficiency and sustainability. This review highlights advancements such as electro-hydraulic actuators, independent metering systems, and digital hydraulics, which enable precise flow control and minimize throttling losses. The integration of energy recovery systems, including hydraulic accumulators and hybrid architectures, further enhances efficiency by capturing and reusing energy during braking and lowering operations. Additionally, the adoption of smart sensors, predictive analytics, and advanced control algorithms enables real-time optimization of hydraulic performance, reducing idle losses and improving overall system responsiveness. Emerging trends such as fluid power electrification, compact high-pressure components, and the use of eco-friendly hydraulic fluids are also discussed. By synthesizing current research and industrial practices, this paper provides insights into the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects for achieving substantial energy efficiency gains through next-generation hydraulic technologies in heavy earth-moving equipment.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.16046v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.",

    "content": "MANVILLE, N.J.—Richard Onderko said he will never forget the terrifying Saturday morning back in 1971 when the water rose so swiftly at his childhood home here that he and his brother had to be rescued by boat as the torrential rain from the remnants of Hurricane Doria swept through the neighborhood.\nIt wasn’t the first time—or the last—that the town endured horrific downpours. In fact, the working-class town of 11,000, about 25 miles southwest of Newark, has long been known for getting swamped by tropical storms, nor’easters or even just a wicked rain. It was so bad, Onderko recalled, that the constant threat of flooding had strained his parents’ marriage, with his mom wanting to sell and his dad intent on staying.\nEventually, his parents moved to Florida, selling the two-story house on North Second Avenue in 1995. But the new homeowner didn’t do so well either when storms hit, and in 2015, the property was sold one final time: to a state-run program that buys and demolishes houses in flood zones and permanently restores the property to open space.\n“It’s pretty traumatic to watch your childhood home be bulldozed,” said Onderko, 64 and now the mayor of this 2.5-square-mile borough, which sits at the confluence of two rivers and a placid-looking brook that turns into a raging river when a storm moves through.\nBlue Acres\nHis boyhood property—now just a grass lot—is one of some 1,200 properties that have been acquired across New Jersey by the state’s Blue Acres program, which has used more than $234 million in federal and state funds to pay fair market value to homeowners in flood-prone areas who, like the Onderko family, had grown weary of getting flooded over and over again.\nThe program, started in 1995, is considered a national model as buyouts are an increasingly important tool for dealing with climate-related flooding. A report this month by Georgetown Climate Center said the program has achieved “significant results” by moving quicker than federal buyout programs",

Conducted under the KOP-TEYAP initiative in Kırşehir Province, Türkiye, the research assesses whether farmers can consistently produce vermicompost that meets international quality standards following a participatory training and infrastructure support model. Fourteen farmers, selected through a merit-based process from 232 trainees, were provided with standardized production units. The produced vermicompost was analyzed for critical chemical parameters (pH, EC, organic matter, C:N ratio, K, Cu, Zn) and biological indicators (basal CO2 respiration, microbial biomass carbon) and benchmarked against regulations from the EU, France, Germany, Austria, Canada, India, and Türkiye. Results indicated that the majority of farmer-produced samples successfully met the critical thresholds for chemical quality and safety. Furthermore, biological maturity was confirmed by low basal respiration levels and high microbial biomass across the samples. These findings demonstrate that structured farmer training combined with standardized low-cost infrastructure enables smallholders to reliably produce high-quality vermicompost, validating this model as an effective agroecological strategy for rural development.",

    "content": "The electrification of agricultural tractors is a key step toward improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental emissions. However, quantitative evaluation of drivetrain performance remains limited because workload data for electric tractors are scarce, while most available datasets originate from conventional mechanical tractors. In this study, a one-dimensional simulation model was developed to effectively utilize existing workload data by integrating the drivetrain and electrical characteristics of an actual electric tractor. The model combines an electrical subsystem based on field-oriented control (FOC) of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with a vehicle subsystem representing the mechanical drivetrain. Model validation was performed through dynamometer experiments using axle torque as input and motor responses as output, showing strong agreement with measured data. The validated model was applied to field-measured workloads to analyze motor performance, battery state-of-charge behavior, usable operating time, and operating points across various agricultural operations. The proposed simulation model enables quantitative evaluation of electric tractor performance under realistic load conditions and can be extended for co-simulation with higher-level control models. In future studies, the model will be utilized as a platform for testing and developing energy-efficient control algorithms for next-generation electric tractor systems.",

    "content": "Ethical hacking is entering a new phase as artificial intelligence and automation become deeply embedded in cybersecurity workflows. AI-powered tools are now capable of scanning systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and simulating attacks at a speed and scale previously impossible for human teams alone. This shift matters as cyber threats grow more frequent, sophisticated, and costly across industries. Enterprises, governments, and startups are increasingly relying on AI-assisted ethical hackers to secure digital infrastructure. The result is a faster, more adaptive approach to cybersecurity that redefines how defenses are built and tested. Background & Context Traditional ethical hacking relied heavily on manual penetration testing, rule-based scanners, and human expertise to uncover weaknesses. While effective, these methods struggled to keep pace with rapidly changing attack techniques and expanding digital environments. The rise of cloud computing, remote work, and connected devices significantly increased the attack surface. At the same time, advances in machine learning and large-scale data analysis made it possible to automate pattern recognition and anomaly detection. These developments set the stage for AI-driven ethical hacking to move from experimentation into mainstream security practice. Key Facts / What Happened AI automation is now being used to continuously scan networks, applications, and endpoints for vulnerabilities. Machine learning models can prioritize risks based on potential impact rather than simple severity scores. Automated penetration testing platforms can simulate thousands of attack scenarios in parallel. AI systems also learn from previous breaches and attack patterns to predict where future weaknesses may emerge. This approach allows security teams to focus on remediation and strategy rather than repetitive manual testing.

However, their persistence in soil can lead to long-term environmental contamination and pose health risks to humans and other organisms through indirect exposure via the food chain. In this study, we used in silico approaches like Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modelling, Intelligent Consensus Prediction (ICP), and chemical read-across to predict the soil degradation half-lives of various pesticides. Models were established using 2D molecular descriptors, thoroughly validated with the help of training and test sets validation parameters, and conformed to OECD guidelines. The predictive models were applied to the Pesticide Properties Database (PPDB) to demonstrate their utility in screening untested and/or newly synthesized pesticides, considering the domain of applicability. Key structural features associated with degradation were identified, providing valuable insights for the design of biodegradable and environmentally safer pesticides.

    "content": "Against the backdrop of China’s “triple carbon” goals, carbon peaking by 2030, carbon reduction by 2035, and carbon neutrality by 2060, examining the impacts of the clean energy equipment manufacturing industry’s (CEEMI’s) imports on carbon emissions holds significant practical importance for promoting sustainable development. Based on provincial panel data from 2001 to 2023, we employed a STIRPAT model to analyze how the CEEMI’s imports affect China’s carbon emissions. We further explored the sustainable transformation mechanism from two perspectives, global value chain (GVC) participation and green technological progress. The results indicate that a 1% increase in imports leads to a 0.1312% reduction in carbon emissions. Mechanism tests show that imports lower emissions primarily by increasing backward GVC participation and promoting green patent innovation. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals that the emission-abating effects are more pronounced in high-income and industry-dominated provinces, and that imports of lithium batteries exhibit stronger emission-abating effects than those of wind turbines and solar PVs.",

Want na jarenlange groei steeg de CO2-uitstoot van China dit jaar niet verder. Daardoor lijkt het erop dat 's werelds grootste uitstoter van broeikasgassen sneller dan verwacht over zijn piek heen is. \"En als China piekt, dan piekt waarschijnlijk de wereld\", zegt Detlef van Vuuren, klimaatwetenschapper aan de Universiteit Utrecht en het Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving.

    "title": "Comparison of Time- and Frequency-Domain Methods for Assessing Brain Compliance in Brain",
    "content": "Introduction: Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is commonly used in neuro-intensive care, but its utility may be limited by a suboptimal use. The brain pressure-volume relationship, a potential predictor of neurological health, is now approached using time-domain methods, which can be challenging to implement. Frequency-domain methods may offer an alternative, but their relationship with time-domain metrics remains unclear. This study compares time- and frequency-domain methods for assessing brain compliance and evaluates their real-time usability. Methodology: A monocentric, prospective observational study was conducted in the neurological ICU of the Hospices Civils de Lyon, France, to evaluate markers of brain compliance. Adult patients with brain lesions requiring multimodal monitoring were included. Continuous high-density physiological data, including ICP, arterial blood pressure (ABP), end-tidal CO2, and electrocardiogram (ECG), were collected for analysis. Some spontaneous ICP rise events were automatically detected based on heuristic criteria and used as brain compliance challenges to compare the co-evolution of metrics across multiple time windows. Time-domain (pulse shape-related metrics) and frequency-domain analyses (examining heart and respiratory components in ICP) were computed to assess the intracranial pressure-volume state. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects modeling, adjusting for vasoactive and sedative medications and Spearman correlations. Results: The study included 66 patients, with a mean age of 49.16 [38.38, 57.58] years. A total of 518 spontaneous ICP rise events were detected in 56 patients. Our findings revealed that: 1) frequency-domain metrics strongly correlated with time-domain metrics during these challenges (r > 0.8, p < 0.001), 2) frequency-domain metrics were significantly drastically less computationally demanding, and 3) the impact of the heart on ICP showed a significant correlation with the P2",

    "title": "Adaptable Teastore with Energy Consumption Awareness: A Case Study",
    "content": "arXiv:2512.23498v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: [Context and Motivation] Global energy consumption has been steadily increasing in recent years, with data centers emerging as major contributors. This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications. [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored. [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varyin",

    "content": "Existing dynamics prediction frameworks for transient stability analysis (TSA) fail to achieve multi-scenario \"universality\"--the inherent ability of a single, pre-trained architecture to generalize across diverse operating conditions, unseen faults, and heterogeneous systems. To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data.",

In a Claude-Code or Codex-CLI session, you can have the agent (or preferably a sub-agent) search for context on prior work using aichat search ... --json which returns JSONL-formatted results ideal for querying/filtering with jq that agents excel at.

    "content": "arXiv:2512.20179v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Current LLM-based driving agents that rely on unstructured plain-text memory suffer from low-precision scene retrieval and inefficient reflection. To address this limitation, we present RESPOND, a structured decision-making framework for LLM-driven agents grounded in explicit risk patterns. RESPOND represents each ego-centric scene using a unified 5 by 3 matrix that encodes spatial topology and road constraints, enabling consistent and reliable retrieval of spatial risk configurations. Based on this representation, a hybrid rule and LLM decision pipeline is developed with a two-tier memory mechanism. In high-risk contexts, exact pattern matching enables rapid and safe reuse of verified actions, while in low-risk contexts, sub-pattern matching supports personalized driving style adaptation. In addition, a pattern-aware reflection mechanism abstracts tactical corrections from crash and near-miss frames to update structured memory, achieving one-crash-to-generalize learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RESPOND. In highway-env, RESPOND outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and reinforcement learning based driving agents while producing substantially fewer collisions. With step-wise human feedback, the agent acquires a Sporty driving style within approximately 20 decision steps through sub-pattern abstraction. For real-world validation, RESPOND is evaluated on 53 high-risk cut-in scenarios extracted from the HighD dataset. For each event, intervention is applied immediately before the cut-in and RESPOND re-decides the driving action. Compared to recorded human behavior, RESPOND reduces subsequent risk in 84.9 percent of scenarios, demonstrating its practical feasibility under real-world driving conditions. These results highlight RESPONDs potential for autonomous driving, personalized driving assistance, and proactive hazard mitigation.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.12560v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Online video understanding is essential for applications like public surveillance and AI glasses. However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available.",

    "content": "Load forecasting plays a vital role in key areas such as energy forecasting and resource management. Traditional forecasting methods are often limited in dealing with shifts in statistical distribution and dynamic changes in periodic parameters of load data, making it difficult to capture complex temporal dependencies and periodic change patterns. To address this challenge, we transform load data into the frequency domain and use a fine-tuned large language model for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Frequency-Based Spatial–Temporal Mixture Learning Model (FSTML), which uses (1) a Frequency-domain Global Learning Module (FGLM), (2) Temporal-Dimension Learning Module (TDLM), and (3) Spatial-Dimension Learning Module (SDLM) to process load data and extract comprehensive temporal patterns. FGLM transfers load data to the frequency domain and provides the model with a frequency-domain global feature representation of load data. The TDLM and SDLM fine tune the pre-trained large language model in the time dimension and space dimension, respectively, extracting the temporal dependency and spatial dependency of load data, respectively, thereby extracting the spatial–temporal pattern of load data. FSTML achieves the best performance in the forecasting task on two public load datasets, and the forecasting accuracy is significantly improved. The high-precision load forecasting model proposed in this study can significantly improve the operational efficiency of power systems and the integration capacity of renewable energy sources, thereby supporting the sustainable development of the power industry in three dimensions: energy optimization, emission reduction, and economic operation.",

    "content": "It’s not a great time to be a direct air capture company in the U.S. During a year when the federal government stepped away from its climate commitments and cut incentives for climate tech and clean energy, investors largely backed away from capital-intensive projects with uncertain economics. And if there were ever an expensive technology without a clear path to profitability, it’s DAC. But as the U.S. retrenches, Japanese corporations are leaning in. Heirloom’s $150 million Series B round late last year featured backing from Japan Airlines, as well as major Japanese conglomerates Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui & Co. Then this month, the startup received an additional infusion of cash from the Development Bank of Japan and the engineering company Chiyoda Corporation. Just days later, DAC project developer Deep Sky announced a strategic partnership with the large financial institution Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation to help build out the country’s DAC market. Experts told me these investments probably won’t lead to much large-scale DAC deployment within Japan, where the geology is poorly suited to carbon sequestration. Many of these corporations likely don’t even plan to purchase DAC-based carbon offsets anytime soon, as they haven’t made the type of bold clean energy commitments seen among U.S. tech giants, and cheaper forestry offsets still dominate the local market. Rather, contrary to current sentiment in the U.S., many simply view it as a fantastic business opportunity. “This is actually a great investment opportunity for Japanese companies now that the U.S. companies are out,” Yuki Sekiguchi, founder of Startup Navigator for Climate Tech and the leader of a group for the Japanese clean tech community, told me. “They get to work with really high caliber startups.

    "content": "Reliable assessments of dam stability require the continuous acquisition and interpretation of deformation data, as monitoring technologies provide essential information for evaluating structural behavior. Surface displacement measurements are particularly valuable for identifying instability within the dam embankment and adjacent slopes. While terrestrial surveying networks can provide accurate point-based observations, they are often time-consuming and costly to maintain. Satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) offers a complementary, cost-effective means of monitoring surface displacement with wide spatial coverage; however, careful analysis is required to avoid misinterpreting superficial motions of riprap and cover materials as true dam settlement. In this study, we use multi-platform SAR datasets, including Sentinel-1A (2014–2019) and high-resolution TerraSAR-X (2018), to investigate the deformation behavior of the Taleqan Dam. We compare LOS displacement derived from InSAR with independent measurements from a terrestrial surveying network spanning the same period. TerraSAR-X data indicate up to ~20 mm of LOS displacement over three months (May–August 2018), and the displacement pattern is consistent with the Sentinel-1 time series. Despite lower spatial resolutions, Sentinel-1 provided dense, temporally continuous coverage, with LOS velocities reaching ~4 mm/yr on the downstream slope. The combined datasets demonstrate that the observed deformation predominantly reflects the ongoing lateral movement of downstream riprap materials rather than the vertical settlement of the dam’s core. These results highlight both the utility of InSAR for long-term dam monitoring and the importance of integrating multi-sensor observations to ensure accurate interpretations of dam deformation signals.",

However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

An integrated framework was applied: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation (using QGIS) for spatial mapping of heavy metals and metalloid; Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model for source apportionment of heavy metals and metalloid; and Monte Carlo simulation for risk quantification.ResultsFour sources were identified with distinct contribution rates: traffic emissions (24.5%), agricultural activities (27.6%), coking industry (16.5%), and other industries (31.4%). Ecological risk was dominated by Hg from the coking industry, while health risk, significantly higher in children, was driven by Cd (heavy metal) and As (metalloid) from agricultural activities, surpassing insights from conventional concentration-oriented assessments.ConclusionThis framework realizes quantitative source-risk linkage, identifying coking-derived Hg and agricultural-derived Cd/As as priority pollutants.

We study FNNs trained with Levenberg–Marquardt (LM), Bayesian Regularization (BR), and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) across three hidden sizes (10, 20, 30) and three topologies: Fitting, Nonlinear Input–Output (Nonlinear I/O), and time-series NAR/NARX. Models are assessed using test MSE and RMSE, correlation (R), generalization gap, convergence indicators (final gradient, damping factor), wall time per epoch, and a relative compute-cost index. On the Fitting task, BR-Fitting-FNN with 20 neurons provides the best accuracy-efficiency balance, while LM-Fitting-FNN with 30 neurons reaches slightly lower error at a higher cost. For Nonlinear I/O, BR-Nonlinear I/O-FNN with 30 neurons achieves the lowest test MSE with clear evidence of effective weight shrinkage; LM-Nonlinear I/O-FNN with 20 neurons is a close alternative. In time-series settings, LM-NAR-FNN with 10 neurons attains the lowest test error and fastest epochs but shows a very negative gap that suggests test-split favorability; BR-NAR-FNN with 30 neurons is more costly yet consistently strong. For NARX, LM-NARX-FNN with 20 neurons yields the best test accuracy and robust convergence. Overall, BR delivers the most reliable accuracy–robustness trade-off as networks widen, LM often achieves the best raw accuracy with careful split validation, and SCG offers the lowest training cost when resources are limited.

Cognitive Analysis (The Scouts): I run quantized VLMs (Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking, Gemma-3-27B-IT, and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506) via llama.cpp. They perform a Chain-of-Thought \"forensic analysis\" to verify if the YOLO objects are actual hazards or just artifacts (like a poster of a person). Inference-Time Consensus (The Judge): A local Ministral-3-14B-Instruct-2512 aggregates reports from multiple scouts. It uses an Explicit Outcome Reward Model (ORM), a Python script that scores generations based on YOLO consistency, to perform a Best-of-N search. The Results (Benchmarked on nuScenes): Recall: 0.966 (vs 0.475 for CLIP ViT-L/14). Hallucination: Reduced Risk Assessment Error by 51% compared to a raw zero-shot VLM. Cost: ~$0.85 per 1k frames (Energy) vs ~$30.00 for GPT-4o. The Tech Stack: Inference: `llama.cpp` server (Dockerized). Models: Q4_K_M GGUFs. UI: Streamlit (for human-in-the-loop verification).

A naive implementation creates a new balance record per deposit, leading to unbounded storage growth and vulnerability to denial-of-service attacks. We present time-bucketed balance records, a data structure that bounds storage to O(k) records per account while guaranteeing that tokens never expire before their configured TTL. Our approach discretizes time into k buckets, coalescing deposits within the same bucket to limit unique expiration timestamps. We prove three key properties: (1) storage is bounded by k+1 records regardless of deposit frequency, (2) actual expiration time is always at least the configured TTL, and (3) adversaries cannot increase a victim's operation cost beyond O(k)[amortized] worst case.

Zontes lleva en España desde el año 2018 y, desde entonces, ha tenido una presencia muy modesta. En China, la cultura de la copia no tiene nada que ver con cómo la percibimos en España: para el país asiático es una forma de reconocer que un producto está bien hecho.

While lithium-ion batteries have long dominated the conversation, their limitations in sustainability, scalability, and material sourcing are prompting scientists and energy companies to explore alternatives. Among these, sand batteries have emerged as one of the most promising innovations — offering a novel, low-cost, and environmentally friendly way to store excess renewable energy as heat for extended periods.\nAccording to the Sand Battery Market Report by Acumen Research and Consulting, the global market was valued at USD 1.22 Billion in 2024 and is expected to reach USD 4.32 Billion by 2033, expanding at a remarkable CAGR of 15.3% from 2025 to 2033. This surge underscores how clean-tech innovation, driven by the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, is transforming the global storage ecosystem.\nWhat Is a Sand Battery\nA sand battery is a thermal energy storage system that uses sand or sand-like materials to store excess heat generated by renewable energy sources like wind and solar. The process involves heating the sand using electricity during periods of surplus energy and releasing that stored heat when needed — making it an excellent option for seasonal or long-duration energy storage.\nUnlike lithium-ion systems, sand batteries:\n• Have minimal environmental impact, as sand is abundant and non-toxic.\n• Offer extended storage duration, retaining heat for months.\n• Require lower production costs due to the availability and affordability of raw materials.\n• Support grid flexibility, enabling renewable energy to be used more consistently.\nTh",

This study proposes a structured framework for assessing the environmental information disclosure quality (EIDQ) of chemical enterprises and develops a generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-driven automated scoring system to enhance evaluation consistency. Using 190 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports from 38 Chinese chemical firms between 2020 and 2024, we applied a multi-stage process combining indicator construction, DeepSeek-V3.2–based large language model (LLM) scoring, and cross-model validation. The results show that EIDQ exhibited a steady upward trend over the study period, reflecting a shift toward more quantitative and verifiable disclosure practices. The AI-generated scores demonstrated a high degree of alignment with human expert evaluations, and robustness tests confirmed the method’s transferability across different large language models. These findings provide methodological evidence for the feasibility of AI-assisted EIDQ assessment and offer practical implications for corporate sustainability reporting and regulatory oversight.",

    "content": "arXiv:2512.16013v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.",

Conventional centralized processing architectures are increasingly unable to handle the volume and velocity of PMU data, particularly in modern grids with dynamic operating conditions.

The proposed framework employs distributed stream processing, containerized microservices, and elastic resource orchestration to enable low-latency ingestion, real-time anomaly detection, and advanced analytics. Machine learning models for time-series analysis are incorporated to enhance grid observability and predictive capabilities. Analytical models are developed to evaluate system latency, throughput, and reliability, showing that the architecture can achieve sub-second response times while scaling to large PMU deployments.

Do solar panels generate more waste than fossil fuels? Waste from discarded solar panels is dwarfed by the waste from coal, oil, and gas. In addition, solar panel recycling capacity continues to expand and improve. A 2023 study estimated that from 2016 – 2050, if power systems do not decarbonize, coal ash would be 300 – 800 times heavier than waste from discarded solar panels, and oily sludge from fossil fuels would be 2 – 5 times heavier. Currently only about 10 – 15% of panels are recycled in the U.S., but governments and companies are funding additional research and new facilities. Existing plants can already recover around 90 – 95% of a panel’s mass, including glass, aluminum, and steel, and up to 95 – 97% of key semiconductor materials such as cadmium and tellurium.

    "content": "by Asad Ullah, Zia Ullah, Sanam Shahla Rizvi, Ibrar Ali Shah, Se Jin Kwon Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are essential for the success of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), providing real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure. However, the highly dynamic and decentralized nature of VANETs introduces significant challenges in ensuring trust and security across the network, including security threats, communication overhead, and energy inefficiencies. This paper presents a novel blockchain-based trust management framework that addresses these issues by incorporating lightweight consensus mechanisms, optimized data propagation strategies, and energy-aware protocols. Our approach reduces communication overhead by selectively propagating trust updates, leading to a 35% decrease in overall network traffic compared to traditional broadcast-based systems. In terms of trust accuracy, our model achieves over 95% accuracy in detecting malicious nodes, significantly outperforming existing solutions. The proposed system demonstrates the identification and penalization of malicious behaviors such as Sybil attacks and false reporting with a 25% improvement in detection rate, while maintaining low latency (an average reduction of 30% compared to PoW-based systems) and efficient energy consumption, reducing energy use by up to 40%. The proposed model also incorporates a hybrid Proof of Stake (PoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, which further enhances its scalability and fault tolerance. Simulation results show that our framework converges to accurate trust values faster than traditional methods, ensuring that reliable trust evaluations are made in real-time, even under high mobility conditions. The combination of these optimizations ensures that our framework is not only secure but also highly efficient, capable of supporting scalable and resilient VANET deployments.

    "content": "The use of Earth-Air-Water Heat Exchangers (EAWHE) for sustainable air conditioning has not been widely studied. Due to their experimental nature, methods of characterizing internal thermal air distribution impose high dependence on instrumentation by sensors and entail data acquisition and computational costs. This document presents an alternative method that estimates air temperature distribution while minimizing the need for a dense network of sensors in the experimental system. The proposed model, DARL (Data of Air and Random Length), can predict the temperature of air circulating inside EAWHEs. DARL is a significant methodological advance that integrates experimental data from boundary conditions with simulations based on pseudo-random numbers (PRNs). These PRNs are generated using Fermat's prime numbers as seeds to initialize the generator. Ordinary linear regressions and robust statistical validations, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and root mean square error, have demonstrated that the model can estimate the thermal distribution of air at different lengths with a relative error of less than 6.2%. These results demonstrate the model's efficiency, predictive capacity, and potential to reduce dependence on sensors.",

Andererseits ist es äußerst schwierig, den tatsächlichen Wasserbedarf von Rechenzentren zu beziffern, da dieser stark vom jeweiligen Standort abhängt.\nWie viel Wasser brauchen KI-Rechenzentren wirklich?\nEs besteht noch immer ein verworrenes Bild davon, wie Rechenzentren tatsächlich Wasser verbrauchen. So schrieb die Journalistin Karen Hao in ihrem Bestseller Empire of AI, ein geplantes Google-Rechenzentrum nahe Santiago de Chile könne „mehr als das Tausendfache des Wasserverbrauchs der gesamten Bevölkerung” benötigen. Inzwischen hat sie sich auf X entschuldigt: Aufgrund eines Missverständnisses bei der verwendeten Einheit sei ihr ein gravierender Fehler unterlaufen.\nParallel dazu kursieren zahlreiche Schätzungen zum Ressourcenverbrauch einzelner KI-Anfragen. Teilweise ist sogar von einer ganzen Flasche Wasser pro KI-generierter E-Mail die Rede. Die Berechnung sei aber deutlich komplexer, als eine einzelne Kennzahl auf eine durchschnittliche Anfrage anzuwenden. Vor Ort wird Wasser vor allem zur Kühlung eingesetzt.

Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute.

The gut microbiome approach is key to sustainable aquaculture by supporting fish health and feed utilization. This study evaluated the effect of taro leaves supplementation on giant gourami growth and gut microbiome composition. Four groups of fish (initial weight 378 ± 26.14 g) were fed commercial feed with 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% taro leaves substitution for 16 weeks. Growth parameters such as absolute weight gain (AWG), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), survival rate (SR), and condition factor (CF) were measured, and gut microbiota was analyzed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing via Oxford Nanopore Technology. The 50% taro leaves group showed significantly higher AWG (78.87 ± 11.96 g, p < 0.05) and PER (1.92 ± 0.37, p < 0.05) compared to the 100% commercial feed (53 ± 5.6 g and 0.54 ± 0.18, respectively). The condition factor of fish in all feeding experiments (1.40-1.55) demonstrated optimal growth conditions. The gut microbiome was dominated by Clostridium, with taro leaves substitution increasing Cellulosilyticum, Fusobacterium, and Ilyobacter, which are linked to cellulose breakdown and SCFA production. These findings suggest that giant gourami do not require solely commercial feed and are promising for sustainable aquaculture practice.",

    "content": "Coastal cities face escalating flood risk under sea-level rise, yet landscape-based adaptation strategies often remain speculative and weakly connected to the accessibility and economic constraints that shape sustainable urban development. This study developed a modeling-to-design framework that translates coupled climate and land-use projections into implementable landscape interventions, through planning-level spatial allocation, using Dalian, China as a case study under “middle of the road” (SSP2-4.5) climate conditions. The framework integrates the Land-use Evolution and Assessment Model (LEAM) with connected-bathtub flood modeling to evaluate whether strategic landscape design can redirect development away from flood-prone zones while accommodating projected growth and maintaining accessibility to employment and services. Interventions—protective wetland restoration (810 km2) and blue–green corridors (8 km2)—derived from a meta-synthesis of implemented coastal projects were operationalized as LEAM spatial constraints. Our results show that residential development can be redirected away from coastal risk with 100% demand satisfaction and elimination of moderate-risk allocations. Cropland demand was fully accommodated. In contrast, commercial development experienced 99.8% reduction under strict coastal protection, reflecting locational dependence on port-adjacent sites. This modeling-to-design framework offers a transferable approach to quantifying where landscape interventions succeed, where they face barriers, and where complementary measures are required, supporting decision-making that balances environmental protection, economic function, and social accessibility in sustainable coastal development.",

    "content": "Europe’s hydrogen strategy has centred almost exclusively on green hydrogen produced through renewable electrolysis as the cornerstone of its decarbonisation agenda. However, recent discoveries of naturally occurring “white hydrogen” in France, Spain, and other parts of Europe raise the prospect of a new, abundant, and low-cost clean energy resource. White hydrogen, generated geologically and extractable directly from subsurface reservoirs, could complement or even disrupt the current power-to-X pathway by offering production costs estimated at €0.75–1 per kilogram, far below today’s €6–8 for green hydrogen. Early geological findings suggest potentially vast reserves, yet the scale, renewability, and environmental impacts remain uncertain. This policy note critically reassesses the European Union’s hydrogen strategy in light of these developments, examining the economic, environmental, and regulatory implications of integrating white hydrogen. It argues for a balanced, adaptive approach: continuing to scale green hydrogen to meet near-term decarbonisation targets while fostering exploration, regulation, and pilot projects for white hydrogen. Such an approach can safeguard Europe’s climate ambitions, mitigate energy security risks, and avoid stranded investments, while positioning the EU to benefit if natural hydrogen proves viable at scale.",

The system combined LLMs and human expertise through a structured process in which English and Kannada lesson plans were co-created by curators and AI; teachers then further customized these curated plans for their classrooms using their own expertise alongside AI support. Drawing on a large-scale mixed-methods study involving 1,043 teachers and 23 curators, we examine how educators collaborate with AI to generate context-sensitive lesson plans, assess the quality of AI-generated content, and analyze shifts in teaching practices within multilingual, low-resource environments. Our findings show that teachers used Shiksha copilot both to meet administrative documentation needs and to support their teaching. The tool eased bureaucratic workload, reduced lesson planning time, and lowered teaching-related stress, while promoting a shift toward activity-based pedagogy. However, systemic challenges such as staffing shortages and administrative demands constrained broader pedagogical change. We frame these findings through the lenses of teacher-AI collaboration and communities of practice to examine the effective integration of AI tools in teaching. Finally, we propose design directions for future teacher-centered EdTech, particularly in multilingual and Global South contexts.",

    "content": "The sustainable future of dairy farming will depend on how trade-offs between environmental impact, economic viability, and animal welfare are managed. Dairy production contributes significantly not only to human nutrition but also to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ammonia release, and water pollution. Comprehensive sustainability assessments are essential for addressing these impacts, also in light of evolving regulations like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. However, existing research on sustainable dairy farming and intensification often overlooks trade-offs with other ecological aspects like biodiversity, economic viability, or animal welfare. This study evaluated the sustainability performance of Austrian dairy farms using a tool called NEU.rind, which combines life cycle assessment (LCA) with other indicators. Applied to 170 dairy farms, the tool identified four sustainability clusters across the dimensions of environmental conditions, efficiency, animal health, and sustainability: (1) Alpine farms (high cow longevity, medium-to-high emissions per kg milk), (2) efficient low-input farms (low emissions, high cow longevity), (3) high-output lowland farms (high productivity, lower animal welfare), and (4) input-intensive lowland farms (high emissions, especially per hectare; inefficient use of resources). The analysis revealed fundamental trade-offs between production intensity, environmental impact, and animal welfare, particularly when comparing product-based (per kg milk) versus hectare-based indicators. Key improvement strategies include increasing the use of regional feed and pasture as well as adapting manure management. For policymakers, these findings underline the importance of site-specific sustainability assessments and the need for region-specific incentive schemes that reward both environmental efficiency and animal health performance.

    "content": "Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.",

Existing research-grade agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to real-world workloads, while proprietary systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a scalable software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated with these mechanisms, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA reaches a Resolve@1 of 54.3%, exceeding prior research baselines and comparing favorably to commercial results, under identical repositories, model backend, and tool access. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA form a general, extensible, and production-grade foundation for building effective and robust coding agents, bridging the gap between research prototypes and practical large-scale deployment.",

Traditional compact thermal models (CTMs) often struggle to scale with the complexity and heterogeneity of modern architectures. This work introduces 3D-ICE 4.0, designed for heterogeneous chip-based systems. Key innovations include: (i) preservation of material heterogeneity and anisotropy directly from industrial layouts, integrated with OpenMP and SuperLU MT-based parallel solvers for scalable performance, (ii) adaptive vertical layer partitioning to accurately model vertical heat conduction, and (iii) temperature-aware non-uniform grid generation. The results with different benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-ICE 4.0 achieves speedups ranging from 3.61x-6.46x over state-of-the-art tools, while reducing grid complexity by more than 23.3% without compromising accuracy. Compared to the commercial software COMSOL, 3D-ICE 4.0 effectively captures both lateral and vertical heat flows, validating its precision and robustness.

    "content": "The proliferation of binary vulnerabilities in the software supply chain has become a critical security challenge. Existing vulnerability detection approaches—including dynamic analysis, static analysis, and decompilation-assisted analysis—all suffer from limitations such as insufficient coverage, high false-positive and false-negative rates, or poor compatibility. Although decompilation technology can serve as a bridge connecting binary-code and source-code vulnerability detection tools, current schemes suffer from inadequate semantic restoration quality and lack of tool compatibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes LLMVulDecompiler, a binary decompilation model based on fine-tuned large language models designed to generate high-precision decompiled code that integrates directly with source-code static analysis tools. We construct a dedicated training and evaluation dataset that covers multiple compiler optimization levels (e.g., O0–O3) and a diverse set of program functionalities. We adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that involves first building foundational decompilation capabilities, then enhancing vulnerability-specific features. Additionally, we design a low-cost inference pipeline and establish multi-dimensional evaluation criteria, including restoration similarity, compilation success rate, and functional correctness. Experimental results show that the model significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of average edit distance, compilation success rate, and black-box test pass rate on the HumanEval-C benchmark. In tests on 12 real-world CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) instances, the approach achieved a detection accuracy of 91.7%, with substantially reduced false-positive and false-negative rates. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of specialized fine-tuning of large language models for binary decompilation and vulnerability detection, offering a new pathway for binary security analysis.",

These materials exhibit superior fire performance compared to synthetic polymers, characterized by low heat release, minimal smoke production, and a high char yield that inhibits flame spread. Some composites have even demonstrated self-extinguishing capabilities. Despite these advantageous properties, their application in the construction industry remains limited. To assess mycelium’s current trajectory, this study analyzes 90 real-world architectural and design projects. Our findings indicate that Ganoderma lucidum and Pleurotus ostreatus are the most commonly used fungi, cultivated on substrates such as straw, wood, and sawdust. Architectural applications are dominated by building blocks, insulation, and facade panels, whereas design and art applications focus on packaging, furniture, and sculptures. A key distinction emerges: architectural projects prioritize function, while artistic projects emphasize esthetic experimentation. Although commercially successful in packaging, the use of mycelium in construction is currently limited to temporary structures. Enhancing its structural and load-bearing properties through further research is essential for its widespread use in architecture.

However, efficiently deploying these systems on serverless GPU platforms presents significant resource allocation challenges due to heterogeneous agent workloads, varying computational demands, and the need for cost-effective scaling. This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85\\% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an $O(N)$ complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics. The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure.",

    "content": "从 Rote 诞生到现在，有两年了，陆陆续续开发和重构了不知道多少个版本，截止写下这篇文章的时候，已经有 860 个 Commits 了，它伴随着我的成长。 诞生背景 关于 Rote 的诞生，毫不避讳的说灵感来自于 usememos 这个开源项目，在更早的时候我是 usememos 的忠实用户，还为 usememos 做了一个小程序的开源客户端（memos_wmp），但是后面慢慢感觉这个项目变得臃肿且复杂，和自己的笔记需求有了更多的分歧。 就自己另起炉灶开发了 Rote，Web 版本在界面和交互设计上更多的借鉴了 Twitter 和 Tailwindcss 官网的我喜欢的设计，实现了自己认为已经足够丝滑和优雅的响应式设计。 虽然有探索页面以及 Reactions ，但是我对它的定义并不是社区。探索页面只是会显示一些用户公开的笔记，就像我自己会经常公开一些自己觉得有意思的内容，其实本质上算是公开笔记功能的副作用。 对我来说公开笔记是为了让对我感兴趣的人，有一个快速了解我在做什么，或者对什么感兴趣的渠道（你可能需要知道，在注册了账户后每个人都会有一个公开的个人页面，类似我的 个人主页，就像 Telegram 的 Channel ，我个人觉得也可以用来做博客，在大概好几年前我就已经丧失了经常去写一些长篇幅内容的心力，像这种笔记片段正好，写起来没有压力） Rote 的核心设计思路 保持克制 - 一切为了优雅的笔记体验，和克制的互动体验 低心智负担 - 更少的压力和更简单直观的记录体验乃至部署体验 开放接口 - 开放 API 接口，支持在任意的场景记录或者获取数据 无拘无束 - 完全掌控你的数据，自由导出数据 已支持的功能 Self-Hosted 的 Server 端以及 Web 端（前后端分离设计） 简单的部署体验，通过 Docker compose 或者 Dokploy 模版快速启动 部署文档 iOS 客户端 支持任意自托管的实例（默认为我自己托管的站点，可通过多次点击登录页面左上角的欢迎文字，切换到你自己的实例） 丝滑的 Web 响应式设计以及沉浸感十足的 PWA 支持 OAuth 支持，目前已经支持 GitHub 和 Apple Login，Google 在计划中 RSS 支持，类似 RSS 订阅 可以订阅我的动态 Reactions 匿名用户或者登录用户都可以对自己的或者别人公开的笔记戳表情 S3 储存支持，默认使用 Cloudflare R2 储存，可以跳过配置 探索页面，用来展示站内所有用户公开的笔记内容 笔记标签，归档状态，可见性状态，附件 基础的组件热力图，标签云，随机回顾以及搜索支持 带有权限控制的 OpenKey 用来部分使用勾选的能力（比如直接通过 GET 请求来添加笔记） 管理员仪表页面，包括站点设置，存储设置，界面设置，用户管理，安全设置，OAuth 登录 实验中的功能，Service Worker 通知（我想让 Rote 实现类似 Bark 的即时通知），数据导出，EveryDayOneCat 小组件 🐱 公开的笔记直链分享 示例笔记，你的个人公开的主页 Rabithua 多语言支持 中文 / 英文 iOS 客户端功能 基础的笔记功能（增删改查） 个人信息以及个人主页 探索页面（可以在里面看到别人公开的有意思的内容以及添加 Reaction） 生成笔记分享图（长按笔记） 自定义界面显示（文字粗细大小，是否显示头像，颜色主题偏好，是否开启震动反馈） 统计页面（现在的笔记数据沉淀太差，未来客户端会着重考虑这块） 几个符合直觉的小组件（最近笔记，随机笔记，热力图） 快捷指令，复制完内容后手动触发快捷指令快速记录笔记（目前尚不稳定，可能在不同的语言环境或者特殊内容情况下出现问题） 按照 标签/可见性/是否归档/时间/关键字 搜索笔记 非常丝滑的时间轴视图 多语言支持 简体中文 / 繁体中文 / 英文 / 日语 / 韩语 / iOS 符合直觉的原生交互体验 可爱的头上长草的未知生物 未知小彩蛋 Rote iOS 客户端目前并没有开源，很惭愧由于生活拮据，未来考虑把 Rote 客户端作为付费项目来维持生计（目前仍然是免费下载），如果哪天我不为生计发愁了，会把它开源出来的。 直接上手 >> Demo ｜ Github ｜ Website ｜ iOS APP ｜ Explore ｜ Rabithua",

    "title": "Biological mitigation of salt stress: Role of halophilic bacteria in exopolysaccharides (EPS) and indole‑3‑acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis.",
    "content": "Soil salinity postures a significant threat to agricultural productivity, exacerbating universal food security challenges. This study investigated the ability of the halophilic bacterium Halobacillus trueperi RSK CAS9 to alleviate salt stress over the exopolysaccharides (EPS) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production. Growth assays revealed that bacterial proliferation decreased with increasing NaCl concentration, demonstrating moderate tolerance at lower concentrations (100-200 mM NaCl). Optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) identified pH 8.0, 15% sucrose, and a 96 h incubation period as optimal conditions for maximal EPS production (272.2 mg/L). Under various NaCl concentrations, the EPS yield peaked at 202.2 mg/L at 200 mM NaCl, suggesting enhanced stress tolerance at moderate salinity levels. SEM analysis showed morphological changes, indicating adaptive biofilm formation. Analysis of FT-IR confirmed the occurrence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and glycosidic bonds, crucial for EPS's protective role. Additionally, IAA production peaked at 1.42 µg/mL under low saline conditions (100 mM NaCl) and decreased at higher salinities, underscoring the bacterium's potential in plant hormone responses under salted stress. Collectively, these results sustenance the potential application of halophilic bacteria as sustainable agents for managing saline stress in agricultural systems.",

    "content": "Probablemente, enviar vehículos fabricados en Estados Unidos a Japón no estaba en los planes de Toyota hace un año por estas fechas. Ahora, el mayor fabricante de automóviles del mundo quiere vender tres modelos de este tipo en su país de origen, que es un centro de exportación con una demanda interna en declive, por lo que la viabilidad económica es dudosa, pero al menos Toyota puede permitirse anteponer la diplomacia.\nEl paladín nacional de Japón tiene como objetivo ofrecer el sedán Camry, el utilitario deportivo Highlander y la camioneta pickup Tundra en su mercado nacional a partir de 2026, según un comunicado de prensa del pasado día 19. Es una forma de terminar el año descabellada en muchos sentidos.\nLas cuentas de suministro no cuadran. El año pasado, el campeón nacional vendió 1,4 millones de coches en Japón, pero fabricó allí más del doble de vehículos. En Estados Unidos ocurre exactamente lo contrario: las ventas de 2,3 millones en 2024 quedaron por detrás de la producción local de 1,3 millones. Y los argumentos para mantener esos coches en Estados Unidos son más sólidos que nunca desde que el presidente Donald Trump sextuplicó los aranceles sobre las importaciones de automóviles procedentes de Japón hasta el 15%, mientras que los fabricados en México y Canadá se enfrentan a aranceles del 25%.\nTampoco está claro si existe demanda. Las ventas de automóviles nuevos en Japón se redujeron por quinto mes consecutivo en noviembre, según Nomura. Es posible que los automóviles más grandes al estilo estadounidense no resulten atractivos: Toyota dejó de ofrecer el Camry fabricado localmente en Japón en 2023 después de que las ventas anuales se redujeran a la mitad en cinco años, hasta menos de 10.000 unidades, según Asian Automobile Analysis. Los coches también podrían ser relativamente caros, ya que Toyota tendría que incluir en el precio, o absorber, los gastos de transporte, mano de obra estadounidense y otros costes.\nUn plan similar anterior tuvo dificultades pa",

    "title": "IoT-based Cost-Effective Fruit Quality Monitoring System using Electronic Nose",
    "content": "Post-harvest losses due to subjective quality assessment cause significant damage to the economy and food safety, especially in countries like Bangladesh. To mitigate such damages, objective decision-making backed by scientific methods is necessary. An IoT-based, cost-effective quality monitoring system can provide a solution by going beyond subjective quality monitoring and decision-making practices. Here, we propose a low-power, cost-effective fruit quality monitoring system with an array of MQ gas sensors, which can be used as an electronic nose. We track the volatile gas emissions, specifically ethanol, methane, and ammonia, encompassing both ripening and decomposition for a set of bananas. Based on the gas concentration thresholds, we develop a mathematical model to accurately assess fruit quality. We also integrate this information into a dashboard for prompt decision-making and monitoring to make it useful to the farmers. This approach has the potential to reduce economic losses, enhance food safety, and provide scalable solutions for the supply chain.",
