Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as \"black boxes\" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16328", "published_date": "2025-10-03T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-03T06:37:44.224318", "language": "en", "tags": ["csai", "computer-science", "research", "preprints", "cslg", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 225, "author": "Xiaoyu Wang, Yijia Xu, Jingyi Huang, Zhengwei Yang, Yanbo Huang, Rajat Bindlish, Zhou Zhang", "raw_content_length": 1613, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 1.125, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["KGML", "the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture", "Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1612, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Knowledge", "Announce Type", "Abstract", "Remote sensing RS technique", "the non-contact acquisition", "extensive ground observations", "a valuable tool", "crop yield predictions", "Traditional process-based models", "large volumes"], "filter_categories": {"business_innovation": ["the non-contact acquisition"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Knowledge": 2.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "Abstract": 1.0, "Remote sensing RS technique": 1.0, "the non-contact acquisition": 1.0, "extensive ground observations": 1.0, "a valuable tool": 1.0, "crop yield predictions": 1.0, "Traditional process-based models": 1.0, "large volumes": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.8239411152777776, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 3.1130000000000004, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.3774, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 3, "reasoning": "This describes a pilot or demo stage.

Using the open-source Switch capacity expansion model with detailed representation of existing U.S. generation and transmission infrastructure, solar, wind, and storage resources, and hourly operations, we evaluate the role of transmission across least-cost, socially optimal, and zero-emissions scenarios for 2050. An optimal nationwide plan would more than triple interregional transmission capacity, yet this reduces the cost of a zero-emissions system by only 7% relative to relying on existing transmission, as storage, solar and wind siting, and nuclear generation serve as close substitutes. Regional cost and rent effects vary, with transmission generally favoring wind and hydrogen resources over solar and batteries. Sensitivity analysis shows diminishing returns: one-fifth of the benefits of full expansion can be achieved with one-twelfth of the added capacity, while cost reductions for batteries and hydrogen provide comparable or greater system savings than transmission. Reconductoring -- quadrupling line capacity at half the cost of new builds achieves nearly all the benefits of unconstrained expansion. These results suggest that while substantial transmission expansion is economically justified, a diverse set of flexibility resources can substitute for large-scale grid build-out, and the relative value of transmission is highly contingent on technological and cost developments.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14189", "published_date": "2025-10-01T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-01T06:39:42.595628", "language": "en", "tags": ["eesssy", "research", "cssy", "q-finec", "preprints", "computer-science", "econgn", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 214, "author": "Rangrang Zheng, Greg Schivley, Matthias Fripp, Michael J.

However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding.

{"id": "science_biorxiv_d46a4536fd4e", "title": "Unfold to refold: Tracking the initial steps of PrPC unfolding in the context of PrPSc propagation", "content": "It might have been believed that elucidation of the atomistic structure of PrPSc would lead to an immediate understanding of the mechanism of prion propagation. However, PrPSc, now known to be a simple amyloid, can just template a previously unfolded polypeptide chain. Therefore, PrPSc can easily template the disordered 90-120 domain of an incoming PrPC molecule, but not its 121-231 folded domain (FD). The FD needs to accommodate into the 121-230 PrPSc surface, an inert procrustean bed. Thus, a mechanism for concerted unfolding/refolding of the FD must exist, with FD unfolding as a key element. To explore how this might happen, we performed thermal unfolding of recombinant bank vole PrPC(90-231), that is a universal PrPSc propagator, tracking changes at the residue level with solution NMR to pinpoint early unfolding propensity. Our data suggest that a key early event is the destabilization of the short {beta}1-{beta}2 assembly, and that the segment contiguous to the disordered tail, 121-140, encompassing {beta}1 and its adjacent coils, is the most likely region to unfold first. Spectroscopic data obtained at higher temperatures suggest that portions of alpha helix 2 are likely the last elements of the FD to unfold and refold into the PrPSc conformation. Molecular Dynamics simulations assisted the interpretation of these changes and suggest separation of 1 from the rest of the FD ensemble. Our data provide a conceivable timeline of the early events in PrPSc-assisted conversion of PrPC and should serve as a starting framework to develop a future atomistic model of PrPSc propagation.", "source": "science_biorxiv", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.11.681810v1?rss=1", "published_date": "2025-10-12T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-13T06:42:21.393063", "language": "en", "tags": ["cutting-edge", "biology", "life-sciences", "preprints", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "bioRxiv Subject Collection: All", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 251, "author": "Sabzehei, S., Rigoli, M., Cacheiro, R., Diaz-Arias, I., Erana, H., Lago, R.

We present a search for neutrino emission from these LHAASO-identified Microquasars using ten years of IceCube muon-track data. No significant neutrino signal was found in either single-source or stacking analyses. Our stacking result further shows that the studied microquasars population can only account for a small fraction of the diffuse neutrino flux along the Galactic Plane.

{"id": "ai_engadget_6fd13c22763f", "title": "The best Bluetooth trackers for 2025", "content": "Most people think of AirTags when they picture a Bluetooth tracker. And indeed, Apple’s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple’s network too. In short, you’ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more. So we tested all the major brands out there to see how they work and put together a guide to help you get the most out of your chosen tracker. Here are the best Bluetooth trackers you can buy. Table of contents The best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device How we tested Bluetooth trackers Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Bluetooth tracker FAQs Best Bluetooth trackers for 2025 What to look for in a Bluetooth tracking device Bluetooth trackers are small discs or cards that rely on short-range, low-energy wireless signals to communicate with your smartphone. Attach one of these gadgets your stuff and, if it’s in range, your phone can “ring” the chip so you can find it. These tracking devices offer other features like separation alerts to tell you when you’ve left a tagged item behind, or where a lost item was last detected. Some can even tap into a larger network of smartphones to track down your device when you’re out of range. Depending on what you want the tracker to do, there are a few specs to look for when deciding which to get. Device compatibility Like most things from the folks in Cupertino, AirTags only work with products in the Apple ecosystem. Both Apple and Google have opened up access to the Find My and Find Hub networks to third-party manufacturers, including Chipolo and Pebblebee. Those two companies make device-agnostic models that will work with the larger tracking network from either brand, so iPhone and Android users can buy the same tag. Tile trackers work with either Android or Apple devices, but use Tile’s own Life 360 finding network. Samsung’s latest fob, the Galaxy SmartTag2, only works with Samsung phones and taps into a finding system that relies on other Samsung devices to locate lost tags. Finding network Crowd-sourced finding capabilities are what make headlines, with stories about recovering stolen equipment or tracking lost luggage across the globe. Using anonymous signals that ping other people’s devices, these Bluetooth tracking devices can potentially tell you where a tagged item is, even if your smartphone is out of Bluetooth range. Apple’s Find My network is the largest, with over a billion iPhones and iPads in service all running Apple’s Find My app by default. So unless an iPhone user opts out, their phone silently acts as a location detector for any nearby AirTags. Apple recently increased the AirTag’s finding power by enabling you to share the location of a lost tag with a third party, party, like an airline. Chipolo fobs that work on Apple’s network have the same ability. Google launched its Find My Device network in 2024 and has since renamed it Find Hub, which, like Apple's fining app, combines devices and people finding in one place. That network is now a close second for the largest in the US Now that Google’s Find Hub network is up and running, it’s a close second for the largest in the US. Like Apple, Android users are automatically part of the network, but can opt-out by selecting the Google services option in their phone’s Settings app and toggling the option in the Find Hub menu. Samsung’s SmartTag 2 and related network also defaults to an opt-in status for finding tags and other devices. Tile offers a large finding grid that includes Tile users, Amazon Sidewalk customers and people running the Life360 network. Life360 acquired Tile in 2021, and, according to the company, the Life360 network has more than 70 million monthly active users. In our tests, AirTags and third-party tags using its network, like the Chipolo Loop and Pop and the Pebblebee Clip Universal, were the fastest to track down lost items. They offered nearly real-time location data in moderately to heavily trafficked spots around Albuquerque, including a bar, bookstore and coffee shops in Nob Hill, along with various outdoor hangouts on UNM’s campus. Samsung's SmartTags were able to locate our lost items most of the time, though not with the same precision finding accuracy as AirTags. When we tested Google’s Find Hub (then called Find My Device) network right after launch, it was noticeably slower than Apple’s network when using the community finding feature. Testing it again in 2025, the time it took to locate a lost item was considerably improved, taking less than 20 minutes on average for the community to track a fob. In our tests, Tile’s finding network wasn’t able to consistently locate its lost fobs. Amy Skorheim / Engadget Separation alerts A tracker’s day-to-day utility becomes really apparent when it prevents you from losing something in the first place. Separation alerts tell you when you’ve traveled too far from your tagged items. Useful if you want to make sure your laptop bag, jacket or umbrella always comes with you when you leave the house. Apple’s Find My app delivers these notifications, but Google’s Find Hub does not. However, if you have a Chipolo device and allow its companion app to run in the background on your Android phone, left-behind alerts are enabled. Tile trackers require a yearly subscription to enable the alerts (currently $7 to $25 monthly). Both AirTags and Tiles allow you to turn off separation alerts at certain locations, meaning you can set your home as a “safe” place where items can be left behind, but alerts will still trigger elsewhere. In our tests, AirTags and others using the Find My network alerted us between the 600- and 1,400-foot mark. Tiles sent a notification after about an average of 1,500 feet and were more consistent when using an Android phone than an iPhone. Chipolo Pop tags paired with an Android phone and using its own app sent an alert when we got around 450 feet away from our tagged item. Connectivity and volume The feature you may use most often is the key finder function, which makes the tracker ring when you hit a button in the app. With Apple's AirTags, you can say \"Hey Siri, where are my keys?\" and the assistant will ring the tag (assuming it doesn't mistakenly think you're asking for directions to the Floridian archipelago). You can also use the Find Item app in your Apple Watch to ring your fob. Asking smart home/personal assistants like Alexa or the Google Assistant to find your keys will work with Chipolo, Tile and Pebblebee trackers linked to your Android device. If you have your tag but can’t find your phone, some trackers will let you ring them to find your handset. SmartTag2 fobs reliably rang our Galaxy phone when we double-pressed it. Tile trackers have the same feature. Chipolo Pop and Loop trackers can ring your phone, but uses the Chipolo app to do so, which can run concurrently with the Find My or Find Hub connection. AirTags and third-party tags using Google’s network don’t offer this feature. The volume of the Bluetooth tracking device may determine whether you can find an item buried in your couch cushions or in a noisy room. AirTags have a reputation for being on the quiet side, and that aligned with what we saw (measuring roughly 65 decibels). Chipolo’s Pop tags and Tile’s Pro model measure between 83 and 86 decibels on average. Pebblebee’s new Clip Universal was the loudest of any tag we’ve tested, clocking in at 91 ear-splitting decibels. Design and alternative formats Design will determine what you can attach the tracker to. AirTags are small, smooth discs that can’t be secured to anything without accessories, which are numerous, but that is an additional cost to consider. Chipolo, Pebblebee and Tile offer trackers with holes that easily attach to your key ring, and all three companies also offer card-shaped versions designed to fit in your wallet. Pebblebee Clip Universal tags come with a handy carabiner-style key ring. You can even get trackers embedded into useful items like luggage locks. The SmartLock from KeySmart is a TSA-approved luggage lock, but in addition to the three digit code, it’s also a Bluetooth tracker that’s compatible with Apple Find My. It wasn’t quite as loud as other trackers in my tests, and the range wasn’t as long, but it paired easily and worked with Apple’s finding network just like an AirTag. Battery life AirTag, Tile Pro, SmartTag2 and Chipolo Pop fobs use replaceable batteries and each should go for at least a year before needing to be swapped. Tile Mate and card-shaped trackers don’t have replaceable batteries, which means you’ll have to replace the entire unit whenever it dies. Pebblebee Clip Universal Clip Universal and Chipolo Loop trackers are rechargeable via a standard USB-C port. They’re also equipped with onboard LEDs (though the light on the Loop is barely noticeable). Stalking, theft and data privacy AirTags have gotten a lot of attention and even prompted some lawsuits for Apple due to bad actors planting them on people in order to stalk them. While this fact may not influence your buying decision, any discussion of Bluetooth trackers should note what steps Apple, Google and Tile have taken to address the issue. Last year, all the major players in the Bluetooth tracker business teamed up to combat misuse and standardize how unauthorized tracking detection and alerts work for iOS and Android. Last year, Tile launched a feature called Anti-Theft Mode, which enables you to render one of its trackers undetectable by others. That means if someone steals your tagged item, they won’t be able to use the anti-stalking features to find and disable the tracker. That sort of negates one of the major ways potential stalking victims can stay safe, so Tile hopes ID verification and a $1 million penalty will deter misuse. As a theft deterrent, a Bluetooth tracker may or may not be the best option. Anecdotal stories abound in which people have recovered stolen goods using a tracker — but other tales are more cautionary. Neither Apple nor Google promotes its trackers or finding networks as a way to deal with theft. GPS trackers, on the other hand, are typically marketed for just that purpose. How we tested Bluetooth trackers Before deciding on which trackers to test, we researched the field, looking at user reviews on Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers, along with discussions on sites like Reddit. We also checked out what other publications had to say on the matter before narrowing down our options. Here’s the full list of every tracker we tested: Apple AirTag Chipolo Card Spot Chipolo One Spot Chipolo One Chipolo Card Chipolo Loop Chipolo Pop KeySmart SmartLock Motorola Moto Tag Pebblebe Clip Universal Pebblebee Clip Samsung SmartTag 2 Chipolo One Point Pebblebee Clip for Android Tile Pro (2024) Tile Mate (2024) Tile Mate (2022) Tile Pro (2022) Tile Slim (2022) After acquiring the trackers, I tested each one over the course of a few weeks using both an iPhone 11 followed by an iPhone 16 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 then an S23 Ultra. I recreated likely user experiences, such as losing and leaving items behind at home and out in the city. I planted trackers at different spots near downtown Albuquerque, mostly concentrated in and around the University of New Mexico and the surrounding neighborhood of Nob Hill. Later, I conducted tests in the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle. Each test was performed multiple times, both while walking and driving and I used the measure distance feature on Google Maps to track footage for alerts. I paid attention to how easy the app was to use, how reliable the phone-to-tracker connection was and any other perks and drawbacks that came up during regular use. As new trackers come to market, or as we learn of worthy models to try, I'll test them and add the results to this guide. Other Bluetooth trackers we tested Motorola Moto Tag The Moto Tag haunts me. At this very moment, my Galaxy phone says the fob is “Near you right now.” But I don’t know where. I tap to play a sound and the Find Hub tries, but ultimately says it can’t. I tap the Find Nearby function that’s supposed to visually guide you to the tag. I parade my phone around the house like a divining rod, take it down into the basement, walk it all over the garage. Nothing. But the Hub app unendingly says the Moto Tag is “Near you right now” and I get flashes of every old-school horror movie where the telephone operator tells the soon-to-be victim that the call is coming from inside the house. It’s partly my fault. I tend to keep good tabs on the gadgets I test for work. But during my most recent move, the tiny green disc didn’t make it into the safety of my review unit cabinet after relocation. Perhaps in retribution for my neglect, the Moto Tag keeps itself just out of reach. Taunting me. I’ll let you know if I ever find it, but in the meantime, it’s clear this finding device doesn’t want to be found. The recommended tags in this guide will serve you better. Tile Pro and Tile Mate (2024) Tile recently came out with a new suite of trackers, replacing the Tile Mate, Tile Pro, Tile Sticker and Tile Slim with updated models. In addition to fun new colors for the Mate and Slim, Tile added an SOS feature that can send a notification to your Life360 Circle when you triple press the button on the tracker. It’s a clever addition that turns your keys into a panic button, something offered by personal safety companies as standalone devices. There are a few caveats: You and the people you want to notify in an emergency will need the Life360 app installed on your phones. If you want your Tile to also trigger a call to emergency services, you’ll need a $15-per-month Life360 subscription (that’s in addition to a Tile membership, which starts at $3/month or $30 annually). And enabling the SOS triple-press disables the ability to ring your phone with the fob. I tested the SOS feature and it did indeed send a text message to my Circle, with the message that I had triggered an SOS and a link to a website that showed my current location. I thought it odd that the link didn’t open the Life360 app (which shows the location of users' phones), but I wasn’t as much concerned with Tile’s personal safety features as I was with the tracking capabilities, which turned out to be less than ideal. For my tests, I planted Tile trackers in a densely populated area of Seattle (about 15,000 people per square mile). After setting the trackers to “lost” in the Tile app, I waited. After four hours, one of the trackers was not discovered by the finding community, so I went and retrieved it. Another fob I planted alerted me that the tracker had been found by the Tile community after three hours — but the location it gave me was off by a third of a mile. I then decided to plant a tracker in the busiest place I could think of — the dried fruit and nuts aisle of a Trader Joes on a Friday evening before a major holiday. It still took over a half an hour before another Tile user anonymously pinged my lost tracker. In my tests with Samsung’s trackers and the fobs on Google’s Find Hub network, it took around ten minutes for them to be discovered. AirTags took half that time and all were tested in a far less populated city. Four hours with no ping and over a half hour before getting a hit in a crowded TJs were pretty long stretches. Tile devices work with both mobile operating systems and its latest models are indeed louder than they were before. But they aren’t as quick to connect and you need to pay for a membership to activate left-behind alerts. And when you do, those notifications don’t kick in as quickly as they do with competing trackers. Bluetooth tracker FAQs Which Bluetooth tracker has the longest range? Both the Tile Pro and the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 claim a maximum range of around 400 feet, which is longer than the 300-foot claim for Chipolo’s Pop tags. The Pebblebee Clip Universal claims a 500-foot range, though other trackers with a shorter claimed range performed better in our tests. Apple doesn’t make range claims for AirTags. Any Bluetooth signal, of course, is dependent on a few factors. Obstacles like walls and people can block the signal, so a clear line of sight is the only way to achieve the maximum range. Other signals, like Wi-Fi, can also interfere with Bluetooth connections. Even high humidity can have an effect and lessen the distance at which your phone will connect to your tracker. Remember, when considering the range of Bluetooth trackers, the size of the “finding network” also comes into play. This is the number of nearby phones that can be used to anonymously ping your tracker when your own phone is out of Bluetooth range. As of now, Apple AirTags have the largest network, followed by Google’s Find Hub, Samsung’s finding community and Tile’s Life360 members. What is the best Bluetooth tracker for a car? Bluetooth trackers are designed to track small, personal items like keys, jackets, backpacks and the like. All trackers have safeguards to prohibit the tag from being used to stalk people, so most will alert someone if a tracker that does not belong to them is detected following them. That means a car thief may get tipped off that there’s a tracker in the car they’re trying to steal. That said, you’ll see plenty of stories about people finding their car thanks to a Bluetooth tracker. Some police departments have even handed out trackers to combat high rates of carjacking. In most instances, the tracker of choice has been AirTags thanks to their wide finding network. If you’re looking for a tracker for your car, you may want to look into GPS trackers, some of which are designed for just that purpose. How accurate are Bluetooth trackers? Accuracy for Bluetooth trackers can be looked at in two ways: Finding items nearby and finding items misplaced outside your home. For nearby items, you’ll most often use the ring function on the device to hunt it down. Apple’s AirTags also use ultra-wideband technology, which creates directional navigation on your phone to get you within a foot of the tracker. Accurately finding lost items outside your home depends on the size of the finding network. Since this relies on the serendipity of a random phone passing within Bluetooth range of your tracker, the more phones on a given network, the better. And since Bluetooth ranges and distance estimates are only precise within about a meter or so, getting pings from more than one phone will help locating items. Here again, it’s worth noting that Apple’s Find My network is the largest, followed by Google, Samsung and Tile (both Chipolo and Pebblebee have fobs that work with the Apple and Google networks).

In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article. Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions. The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.", "source": "science_arxiv_math", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10897", "published_date": "2025-10-14T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-14T06:40:22.273636", "language": "en", "tags": ["preprints", "mathap", "math-ph", "mathmp", "cond-matquant-gas", "research", "mathematics", "cond-matmes-hall", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "math updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 241, "author": "Benjamin Anwasia, Diogo Ars\\'enio", "raw_content_length": 1700, "priority": 8, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 1.205, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": ["Fermi"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 1693, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Hydrodynamics", "degenerate Fermi gases", "spherical Fermi surfaces", "new Abstract", "the description", "a Fermi gas", "free electrons", "Fermi", "a precise mathematical understanding", "the Fermi ground state"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Hydrodynamics": 2.0, "degenerate Fermi gases": 2.0, "spherical Fermi surfaces": 2.0, "new Abstract": 1.0, "the description": 1.0, "a Fermi gas": 1.0, "free electrons": 1.0, "Fermi": 1.0, "a precise mathematical understanding": 1.0, "the Fermi ground state": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.785544506388889, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 8.453999999999999, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.6908, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.8526, "joy": 0.0463, "surprise": 0.0618, "sadness": 0.0066, "fear": 0.0085, "anger": 0.0191, "disgust": 0.0051}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 1, "reasoning": "This is a theoretical physics paper describing a mathematical model.

{"id": "ai_engadget_0a32e3ec86c4", "title": "Court reduces damages Meta will get from spyware maker NSO Group but bans it from WhatsApp", "content": "US District Judge Phyllis Hamilton has reduced the damages Meta is getting from the NSO Group from $167 million to $4 million, but she has also ordered the Israeli spyware maker to stop targeting WhatsApp. If you'll recall, Meta sued the NSO Group in 2019 over its Pegasus spyware, which it said was used to spy on 1,400 people from 20 countries, including journalists and human rights activists. Meta said at the time that Pegasus can infect targets' devices even without their participation by sending text messages with malicious codes to WhatsApp. Even a missed call is enough to infect somebody's device. According to Courthouse News Service, Hamilton reduced the damages because they would need to follow a legal framework designed to proportionate damages. However, she has also handed down a permanent injunction on the NSO Group's efforts to break into WhatsApp. In her decision, she took note of statements made by NSO's lawyers and its own CEO revealing that it hasn't stopped collecting WhatsApp messages and trying to get around the messaging app's security measures. The defendants previously said that the injunction Meta was requesting would \"put NSO‚Äôs entire enterprise at risk\" and \"force NSO out of business,\" since WhatsApp is one of the Pegasus spyware's main ways to infect targets' devices. \"Today‚Äôs ruling bans spyware maker NSO from ever targeting WhatsApp and our global users again,\" said Will Cathcart, Head of WhatsApp. \"We applaud this decision that comes after six years of litigation to hold NSO accountable for targeting members of civil society. It sets an important precedent that there are serious consequences to attacking an American company.\" Hamilton wrote that the proposed injunction requires the Israeli company to delete and destroy computer code related to Meta's platforms, and that she concluded that the provision is \"necessary to prevent future violations, especially given the undetectable nature of defendants‚Äô technology.\" It's not quite clear how Meta will ensure that the NSO Group doesn't use WhatsApp to infect its users' devices again. Notably, the NSO Group was recently acquired by an American investment group that invested tens of millions of dollars into it to take controlling ownership.

Recent advances in radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82 cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility for robotics evaluation.

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_f985a03e4fdf", "title": "Remote work is shaped by geopolitics, not technology", "content": "Once upon a time, the big idea was simple—work from anywhere! Thanks to technological advances, you didn’t need to be tethered to your office desk to collaborate with coworkers (or swap memes with them). As long as you had your laptop and good Wi-Fi you could be by the pool on a tropical island, drink in hand, and a magnificent sunset in the background. Forward-thinking companies would recognize that talent could be found in the most unexpected places. Employees get to mix and match their work with the life they love. Governments would enable this with offers of special digital nomad visas. The whole world would become one big, friendly workplace. Hold that thought. Before you swap suits for flip-flops, you should recognize that the future of work might not be what you pictured. An alternate future is taking shape, where geopolitics is shaping who works, the location of work, and the type of work. Driven by national security concerns and a proclivity to support “their” companies at the expense of “others,” governments are reshaping the future of work. YOUR remote work (Can YOU do the work remotely?) The first promise of remote work was that work could be democratized. More people from around the world could access jobs in a far more distributed model of talent and collaboration. Ideas flow across the world and organizations benefit from a more global intelligence. But that promise collides with geopolitical reality. Take the case of Apple. As the company started to move some of its manufacturing operations to India, it needed to hire workers at scale. According to an Economic Times report, Apple’s ecosystem in India was expected to create 600,000 jobs. But who works at these facilities is an increasingly geopolitically fraught question. There were initially hundreds of Chinese engineers and technicians supporting Apple’s expansion in India. But more than 300 of them were asked to return to China recently. The recall of engineers—the second in recent months—was seen as a push by China to curb technology transfer to Indian operations and prevent manufacturing exits from the country. To continue operations, Apple’s suppliers have turned to engineers from Taiwan. Driven by geopolitical objectives, government restrictions increasingly shape who can work on leading or cutting-edge projects, the individuals a company can hire, and how long they can stay in those roles. Global companies are taking a close, hard look at their workforce and making difficult choices about who gets to work on different types of projects. Technology companies in Silicon Valley are increasing security vetting of potential recruits to keep commercial information secure. Changing tariff rates could risk millions of jobs in Asia and elsewhere. Thai workers manufacturing solar cells are bearing the brunt of a trade war between China and the U.S. A large-scale study of foreign directors in listed Chinese firms found that as political relations deteriorated, foreign directors were more likely to exit from their roles. On the other hand, scientists at U.S. federal agencies facing layoffs—especially those with expertise in artificial intelligence—were targeted for recruitment to research operations in China. your REMOTE work (Can you do the work REMOTELY?) The second promise of remote work is that work could be done from anywhere. As the technology continues to improve, employees don’t need to be in the office or even in the country. Digital nomads skipped through cities, countries, or even continents. You could log in to work while also visiting your family in another country. You adopt a more flexible lifestyle. But geopolitical reality strikes again. As countries emphasize sovereignty, data security, and the protection of strategic interests, the data, models, and technology resources that can be used from other countries becomes more limited. The Financial Times reported that foreign universities and research institutes lost access to China’s largest academic database. More countries are adopting data localization laws, which require businesses to store certain types of data within the country to protect national security. The U.S. restricts the transfer of citizens’ data to countries of concern. Such requirements make it harder to access data and information from another country, even for employees of the same company. American business travelers to China may not, for instance, have access to their work email. Financial analysts working at a fanatic pace to evaluate deal opportunities may find that they need to be on the ground in a given market to access relevant data, not because the technology to transfer those data to another country doesn’t exist, but because political interests prevent the transfer of such data overseas. Some companies are asking staff traveling to certain countries to use temporary loaner phones and not bring company laptops. Without your trusty laptop, expect disruptions to work and productivity. your remote WORK (Can you do the WORK remotely?) The final promise of remote work is that technology would allow you to do your job; i.e., execute the same tasks as you would have when it was business-as-usual. But geopolitics has changed the job description for many employees. Focusing on teams, operations, or finances of a business used to be the typical mandate for a manager. With appropriate routines in place, these tasks could even be completed from a remote location. But today’s managers have to take on different tasks. Consider Jensen Huang, the CEO of the world’s most valuable company, NVIDIA. For years, Mr. Huang avoided the rough and tumble world of Washington lobbying, preferring the company of the video-gamers. But when the company’s AI chips became enmeshed in global politics, Mr. Huang’s work changed. He crisscrossed the world convincing lawmakers to facilitate the sales of his company’s chips. He became a geopolitical superstar convincing leaders from the U.S. to China about his company’s role in their vision. Mr. Huang is not alone. Fortune reported on how companies set up teams to track political developments and quickly present leadership with options—but that those team members completely dropped their day jobs. With the need to have an ear to the ground and interact with political actors, remote work becomes increasingly challenging.", "source": "industry_intelligence_fast_company", "source_type": "rss",

We conducted an initial investigation into the spatial utilization and habitat selection patterns of a femal red panda using GPS collar technology. Our research revealed that the home range and core activity area of the red panda was larger during initial 60 days after release, and markedly decreased thereafter. The red panda’s selection of altitude did not align with that of wild individuals until 60 days after release, whereas slope selection may require at least 30 days to stabilize and become consistent with wild individuals’ patterns. Our study further revealed that the home range and core activity area of the red panda showed low overlap with the suitable habitat of the wild population during the initial two months; however, this overlap increased significantly, reaching over 90% thereafter. We hypothesize that the red panda may require at least 60 days to acclimate to its new environment after release.

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_4693c8c45889", "title": "Stock market lulls as Tesla slides and Delta soars", "content": "Wall Street is taking a pause on Thursday as U.S. stocks and even the price of gold pull back from record highs following their torrid runs. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, coming off its latest all-time high and its eighth gain in the last nine days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 145 points, or 0.3%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower. Gold also fell following its stellar rally this year, while Treasury yields held relatively steady in the bond market. They’re taking a moment following big runs driven in large part by expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support the economy. Financial markets have been so relentless, including a roughly 35% leap for the S&P 500 since a low in April, that worries are rising that stock prices may have shot too high and become too expensive. Concerns are particularly strong about the frenzy lifting stocks related to artificial-intelligence technology. Dell Technologies sank 5% for one of the market’s bigger losses, but that only trimmed its surge since talking up its AI growth opportunities earlier in the week. It’s still up 11% for the week so far. Tesla was one of the heaviest weights on the market after falling 2%. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a preliminary evaluation of its “Full Self-Driving” system due to safety concerns. Those losses helped offset a 4.9% ascent for Delta Air Lines, which reported a stronger profit for the summer than analysts expected. Delta also gave a forecast for profit over the full year that topped analysts’ estimates. Its president, Glen Hauenstein, highlighted a broad-based acceleration in sales trends over the last six weeks, including for business travel domestically. Such reports from companies are taking on more significance, offering windows into the strength of the economy. That’s because the U.S. government’s shutdown is delaying reports that would clearly show how the overall economy is doing. This is the second week where the U.S. government has not published its update on unemployment claims, for example, a report that usually guides Wall Street’s trading each Thursday. PepsiCo rose 2.1% after it delivered a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, saying momentum improved for its drinks business in North America. Delivering bigger profits is one of two ways that companies can make their stock prices look less expensive following their big rallies. The other is if their stock prices fall. Akero Therapeutics leaped 16.7% after Novo Nordisk, the Danish maker of weight-loss drug Wegovy, said it would buy the South San Francisco-based drug developer. The price tag could reach $5.2 billion if Akero’s lead product candidate wins federal regulatory approval. MP Materials, a company that mines and processes rare earths in California, rose 7.1% after China announced curbs on its exports of the materials, which are critical for the making of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines. Costco Wholesale climbed 2.4% after the retailer said its revenue rose 8% in September from a year earlier. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe after Italy’s Ferrari tumbled 14.1% following the release of financial forecasts that some analysts said were below their expectations. Stocks in Shanghai leaped 1.3% after trading resumed there following a holiday. Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.8% for another one of the world’s bigger moves. Technology giant SoftBank Group surged 11.4% after it announced a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss engineering firm ABB. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.13%, where it was late Wednesday. —Stan Choe, AP business writer AP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed.", "source": "industry_intelligence_fast_company", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91419607/market-lulls-tesla-delta", "published_date": "2025-10-09T17:30:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-09T18:40:58.915097", "language": "en", "tags": ["news", "technology", "innovation", "business"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Fast Company", "source_category": "industry_intelligence", "word_count": 613, "author": "Associated Press", "raw_content_length": 5578, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 3.065, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Tesla", "the Federal Reserve", "Nasdaq", "Treasury", "Delta"], "persons": [], "locations": ["U.S."], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 3800, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Stock market lulls", "Wall Street", "a pause", "Thursday", "US stocks", "even the price", "gold", "record highs", "their torrid runs", "The SP"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Stock market lulls": 2.0, "Wall Street": 1.0, "a pause": 1.0, "Thursday": 1.0, "US stocks": 1.0, "even the price": 1.0, "gold": 1.0, "record highs": 1.0, "their torrid runs": 1.0, "The SP": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 1.250427402777778, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 7.2940000000000005, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.4588, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.0543, "joy": 0.0025, "surprise": 0.0122, "sadness": 0.0672, "fear": 0.8449, "anger": 0.0059, "disgust": 0.013}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 5, "reasoning": "Tesla's 'Full Self-Driving' system is deployed in vehicles, but its maturity is questionable due to safety concerns.

{"id": "positive_news_the_better_india_bbdf74fd94bb", "title": "Kanpur Farmer Uses Solar Dryers To Turn Flowers Into Profits, Helps 100+ Farmers Earn Better", "content": "The interviews and reporting for this story were conducted in December 2024. Motivated by the emerging market for dehydrated flowers, Shivraj Nishad from Kanpur’s Shekhpur village embarked on a remarkable journey in 2019 that would alter his life and uplift the lives of many in his community. Leaving his job as a pharma executive, the 32-year-old post-grad from Lucknow’s Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Technical University initiated a small-scale venture focused on cultivating, harvesting, and dehydrating local flowers. “I was earning only Rs 21,000, and the job involved frequent travel, keeping me away from home for days,” says Nishad. “I decided to return to farming, but rather than continue with traditional crops on the family’s half-acre plot, I chose to grow butterfly pea, which thrives well here. Returns from growing traditional crops were minimal, and the input costs were high.” From traditional crops to dehydrated flowers Nishad began his venture with just 10 kg of dehydrated flowers and now sells between 20 and 30 tonnes annually, mostly sourced from Shekhpur and neighbouring villages. These villagers were traditionally growing crops like paddy, wheat, and lentils. Previously, the sale of fresh flowers wasn’t lucrative enough; if they couldn’t sell them, the flowers would either be brought back home or discarded into the river. Nishad convinced the farmers to grow these flowers and sell them to him. With his encouragement, the villagers took floriculture more seriously and now grow seven different varieties — Nishad purchases their entire harvest. The growers are paid promptly and no longer have to travel 15 km to the nearest mandi with their produce. When Nishad switched to farming, he chose to grow butterfly pea flowers instead of traditional crops. Initially, Nishad started with butterfly peas and has since expanded his product line to include rose, hibiscus, marigold, calendula, lemongrass, spearmint, tulsi, jasmine, chamomile, and ginger — all used for making teas, syrups, or preserves. “I earn around a lakh rupees a month,” says Nishad, with a turnover ranging between 20 to 30 tonnes annually. He has established a small centre outside the village where farmers from the nearby area come to sell their harvested flowers twice a day — once in the morning and once in the evening. These fresh flowers are dehydrated within 12 to 15 hours. The use of solar dryers was a key turning point in Nishad’s business venture. Initially, he dried flowers in an open environment, exposed to dust, bird droppings, and unpredictable weather conditions, which could damage the product. Eventually, he invested in a solar dryer costing Rs 60,000, which not only accelerated the dehydration process but also ensured that the product remained pure. Solar dryers: A game-changer The solar dryer, consisting of trays placed on a metal stand under a roof of polycarbonate sheets with a total area of about five square metres, is particularly valuable during the monsoon when flowers typically get wasted. With this setup, Nishad can dry two batches of flowers per day, compared to just one using open-air drying methods. “Solar dryers have been a game-changer for us,” says Nishad. “They ensure the highest quality products by preventing dust, preserving colour and texture, protecting against rain, and maintaining overall product quality, which allows farmers to command premium prices in the market.” Nishad fabricated a new solar dryer to dehydrate local flowers. Nishad checking on the dehydrated rose petals in his solar dryer. India stands first in dry flower exports due to its wide availability of various plant species. Dried flowers are exported to the USA, Japan, Europe, and the Middle East. The export industry for dried flowers and plants from India is valued at around Rs 100 crore annually, with over 500 varieties being shipped to 20 countries. “Nishad’s success has attracted the attention of numerous farmers from his region, leading over 100 farmers to collaborate by supplying raw materials, thereby improving their livelihoods. His story inspires other farmers to leverage the locally available farm produce, cater to the challenge of food loss/spoilage, and integrate innovative clean-energy-powered livelihood technology to improve their incomes via value addition,” says Divya Gaur, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). Inspiring farmers to embrace solar drying technology Solar dryers enable farmers to efficiently dry perishable commodities like fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs. These dryers ensure the highest quality products by preventing dust, preserving colour and texture, protecting against rain, and maintaining overall product quality, which allows farmers to command premium prices in the market. A study by CEEW estimates that India has the potential to deploy as many as 1.68 lakh solar dryers, impacting up to 34 lakh livelihoods. States like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat have the highest potential for these solutions. Jasmine flowers grown in the fields locally are harvested and then dehydrated via the solar dryer. Marigold flowers in the solar dryer. Not only has Shivraj guided fellow villagers on the aspects of growing, harvesting, drying, and marketing their produce but also mentored farmers in states like Karnataka, Odisha, and Kerala — ones who came to know of his endeavours through social media. “Farmers like Nishad, who are early adopters of solutions like solar dryers, can inspire millions across the country to embrace technologies like these to boost their incomes and become microentrepreneurs by selling quality dried products,” remarks Gaur. Closer to home, Sonu Kumar (40) from a village in Raebareli, who grows chamomile and calendula on a five-acre plot, sells his entire produce to Nishad. “My village is 100 km from Kanpur, but he picks up my entire harvest, dehydrates it, and sells it. I receive a price ranging from Rs 300 to Rs 450 per kg,” says Sonu. Nishad sells flower teas via his brand, Blue Veda. With rising demand, Nishad has invested in a larger solar dryer that he has custom-fabricated. “I would advise those looking for opportunities in the dehydration of farm produce to consider building their solar dryers. You can create a 500 kg capacity polyhouse solar dryer for Rs 60,000, whereas purchasing one in the market would cost around Rs 3 lakh,” he informs. Soon, he plans to enter the e-commerce market with his brand, Blue Veda, which offers a range of 15 products. The significance of Nishad’s journey extends beyond mere entrepreneurship; his collaborative efforts have not only increased household incomes but have also fostered a spirit of community resilience and cooperation.

The 2025 competition received over 10,000 \"brilliant and hilarious\" entries from 108 countries and has been whittled down to 40 finalists, which include a smoking duck, a prancing gorilla, and some wrestling green frogs. The photographers are competing for the top prize—an incredible one-week safari in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve. Other prizes include Nikon Z6 III and Nikon Z50 II cameras.“We had an awesome year last year and are absolutely delighted to be able to partner with the Nikon team again for 2025,\" Tom Sullam, Comedy Wildlife Competition co-founder, said in a statement. \"Their ongoing support has supercharged the competition, reaching more people in more countries than ever before, helping us raise awareness of animal and habitat conservation and, crucially, highlight the fundamental importance of having wildlife on our planet and in our lives.\"Upworthy's 17 funniest finalists in the 2025 Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards(You can see all of them here)1. \"Now which direction is my nest?\" (gannet) by Alison Tuck, U.K. A gannet in a bad spot.© Alison Tuck / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"A windy day on Bempton Cliffs during the nesting season.\" — Alison Tuck2. \"Welcome to Zen Lemur Yoga Course!\" (ring-tailed lemur) by Andrey Giljov, Russia A lemur telling a fish story.© Andrey Giljov / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"Instructor Lemur demonstrates perfect enthusiasm, reaching high to embrace the universe. Student Lemur contemplates whether enlightenment is worth this much effort before breakfast. Flexibility? Optional. Dramatic flair? Mandatory.\" — Andrey Giljov3. \"Go away\" (white tailed sea eagle) by Annette Kirby, Australia An angry sea eagle.© Annette Kirby / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"In February 2025, I flew from my home in South Australia, where the summer temperatures ranged from mid-20s to mid-40 degrees Celsius, to the island of Hokkadia in Japan, where temperatures were minus degrees, the coldest day being minus 18 degrees Celsius. I experienced a winter wonderland so vastly different from my arid, hot home environment. A highlight was visiting Rausa on the Shirenhoka Peninsula and Nemuro Straits, where the Steller’s Sea Eagle gathers in the winter to fish from drift ice. With fewer than 5000 left in the world, they are listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of threatened species. The female can weigh up to 9.5kg, making it the heaviest eagle in the world. Their wingspan, up to 2.5 metres, is the largest of any living eagle.In Japan, they are protected and designated as national treasures.They are indeed a national treasure, so entertaining to watch and photograph as they fight to protect their catch. A favourite place for them to perch is on the sea wall protecting the fishing fleet at Rausa. They wait watching the boats come into the harbour, hoping for a free feed of fish. I captured this photo of the Steller’s Sea Eagle as it sat in a deep hole in the snow. It had a fish and had flown on the sea wall and found a hole in the deep, fresh snow. Other birds were flying above, and as they came closer, I captured the look they gave me. There was no way it was parting with its catch. As it had made its intentions clear to other competitors, it stayed alert but managed to enjoy its catch.\" — Annette Kirby4. \"I just can't wait to be king\" (lion) by Bret Saalwaechter, U.S.A Laughing lions. © Bret Saalwaechter / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"I’ve always been fascinated by the complex social lives of lions, and there’s no better place to observe them than Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park. I captured this image in September 2024, during the dry season, when dwindling food and water can heighten family tensions. One morning near the Semetu Kopjes, we found a pride locked in a lively standoff - hungry cubs clamoring for milk, mothers giving in briefly before retreating in exhaustion. Life in the dry season is no picnic—lions are anxiously waiting for the Great Migration and the feast it promises—but it makes for some incredible wildlife behavior and these cubs were the stars of the show. For over an hour, they followed their mother around a famous Serengeti kopje—those iconic rocky outcrops that dot the landscape—alternating between trying to suckle and play. Each time the mother, already in a foul mood from the sweltering heat, would give a quick roar of disapproval and escape the circus. But the cubs, like any persistent little ones, would chase her down, nipping at her and yelping for more attention. This back-and-forth drama played out again and again Roaring in protest, the lionesses leapt onto the kopje for a moment’s peace, only to be followed by their relentless offspring. As the chaos peaked, the entire pride erupted in a chorus of roars and wails, giving me the perfect instant to press the shutter.\" — Bret Saalwaechter 5. \"Territorial defence operation\" (white tailed eagle and gull) by Antoine Rezer, France A bird pooping on another bird.© Antoine Rezer / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"Driving along the edge of a fjord in north-western Iceland, I spot some gyrfalcons. I stop and watch them for a long time – there's a whole family! My eye is drawn to a larger bird of prey, a white-tailed eagle. Amazing! It lands after making it clear to the falcons that he's the boss.I feast my eyes on the scene, as it's not every day that I get to witness something like this! When a seagull arrives, I imagine that the eagle will keep it at bay. I'm wrong! The gull's low-level flights follow one after another but are not enough. So the gull changes strategy and drops its bomb on the eagle! The eagle finally flies away, leaving the site to the gull. Motivation can be stronger than size!\" — Antoine Rezer6. \"Relaxing in the trees!\" (yellow-cheeked gibbon) by Diana Rebman, U.S.A. A gibbon chilling out.© Diana Rebman / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"This Yellow-cheeked Gibbon was just hanging out in the trees. Looks like he's waiting for a beer to be served.\" — Diana Rebman7. \"Baptism of the unwilling convert\" (green frog) by Grayson Bell, U.S.A. Wrestling frogs.© Grayson Bell / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards\"One morning I was hanging out with my camera along the edge of a pond near our home. I noticed 2 frogs fighting and took a bunch of photos. This photo captures two male Green frogs, which are native to Maine. They usually have a greenish-brown back, dusky bars on their hind legs, and a lighter underside. Males may have a yellow throat, while females have a white throat. They make a throaty sound like a ‘boink’. In this photo, these two male frogs are jockeying for territory. They will engage in physical confrontations, such as wrestling, to defend a valuable habit that attracts females. I took several shots of them, but this one in particular amused me because it looked like one was trying to baptize the other against his will.\" — Grayson Bell8. \"Peek-a-boo\" (Asian elephant) by Henry Szwinto, U.K. A sheepish elephant.© Photographer’s Name / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"A Sri Lankan Elephant playing peek a boo with his ears.\" — Henry Szwinto 9. \"Bad mouthing\" (leopards) by Hikkaduwa Liyanage Prasantha Vinod, Sri Lanka A leopard talking smack.© Hikkaduwa Liyanage Prasantha Vinod / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"Two females and one male. Here in the selected image, the larger one is the male cub and the other is one of the female cubs. A few minutes before I took this image, these three were playing together on that boulder. Later, a female saw something moving in the bushes and ventured to investigate it. These two also wanted to follow them, but this playful interaction happened before them, following the other sibling.\" — Hikkaduwa Liyanage Prasantha Vinod10. \"Outdoor smoking zone\" (mallard) by Lars Beygang, Germany A smoking duck.© Lars Beygang / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"During the spring months, I was commissioned to photograph the urban wildlife of a city near my hometown in Bavaria. After several early mornings by the pond, I decided to return to the same spot once more. It was a very cold morning, with temperatures low enough to make the breath visible. As the first rays of sunlight broke through from behind, I noticed a mallard perched on a fence, calling out into the air. I quickly pressed the shutter, hoping to capture the visible breath streaming from its beak. The scene made me smile - it looked as if the duck had just stepped outside for a quick smoke in the cold morning light.\" — Lars Beygang11. \"Fonzies advertising\" (sifaka) by Liliana Luca, Italy A rude sifaka.© Liliana Luca/ Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"This moment happened after the tourists had left Nosy Komba (Madagascar). I stopped, letting the silence fall around me, and turned my attention to a group of crowned sifakas (Propithecus deckenii). It was then that he appeared, staring at me with wide, curious eyes, as if questioning my presence... or perhaps my clothing choices. Then, with the grace of a stage actor and the timing of a comedian, he raised his hand, licked it thoughtfully, and then paused mid-gesture, as if he knew exactly what he was doing.The photo immediately reminded me of that old snack commercial:\"If you don't lick your fingers... you're only half enjoying it!\"Ultimately, this is why I love nature photography so much: sometimes nature's sense of humor is better than our own; you just have to be ready to catch it.\" — Liliana Luca12. \"High five\" (gorilla) by Mark Meth-Cohn, U.K. A happy gorilla.© Mark Meth-Cohn / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"This photograph was taken during a trip to Rwanda earlier this year, where we spent four unforgettable days trekking through the misty Virunga Mountains in search of the gorilla families that call them home. On this particular day, we came across a large family group gathered in a forest clearing, the adults were calmly foraging while the youngsters were enthusiastically playing. One young male was especially keen to show off his acrobatic flair; pirouetting, tumbling, and high kicking. Watching his performance was pure joy, and I’m thrilled to have captured his playful spirit in this image.\" — Mark Meth-Cohn13. \"The choir\" (lion) by Meline Ellwanger, U.S.A Lions yawning in unison.Meline Ellwanger © Photographer’s Name / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"A hilariously lucky moment I caught of these these three lions yawning at the same time.\" — Meline Ellwanger14. \"Paint me like one of your forest girls\" (orangutan) by Michael Stavrakakis, Australia A danging orangutang. © Michael Stavrakakis / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards\"This image was captured in the Tanjung Puting National Park in southern Borneo and features Sandra, the oldest known orangutan living in the area. A once-rehabilitated orangutan who had previously lived in captivity, Sandra since been successfully released back into the wild. Known for her quirky and unique character, she quickly grew comfortable with our presence and before long had truly found her stage.\" — Michael Stavrakakis15. \"Squirrel airborne: surrender mode\" (red squirrel) by Stefan Cruysberghs, Belgium A flying squirrel.Stefan Cruysberghs © Photographer’s Name / Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards A few years ago, a simple wooden hide was available for rent in a forest near my home, known for its lively red squirrel population. I had visited the spot several times before, and eventually began experimenting with capturing squirrels mid-jump. This resulted in countless blurry shots, but also a few fun and quirky moments—including the one I submitted. Sadly, the forest has since been cut down due to an infestation of bark beetles, but I still cherish the images I captured of these agile and comical little acrobats. I thought this flying squirrel looks like it’s throwing in the towel mid-air—arms wide, total surrender!\" — Stefan Cruysberghs16. \"Headlock\" (bridled guillemots) by Warren Price, U.K. A guillemot biting another guillemots.© Warren Price/ Nikon Comedy Wildlife Awards \"These guillemots were nesting on a small rocky cliff ledge where space was at a premium. The nests all crammed in close together which isn’t a good recipe for being good neighbours, as guillemots are fiercely territorial. Aggression and battles are frequent over nesting space, and I captured this image of this bemused-looking bridled guillemot, its head firmly clamped in its/neighbour's beak. I liked the way the guillemot was looking directly into my lens, its white eyeliner eyes highlighting its predicament! Sometimes you just want to bite your neighbour's head off..literally!\" — Warren Price17. \"The wig\" (rhino) by Yann Chauvette, Canada A rhino covered in moss.

The study examines the efficacy of PCM as latent heat-storage material and predicts root-zone temperature using three machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in the analysis consists of 2658 data at hourly resolution with six variables from February to April in 2022. A greenhouse with PCM shows a remarkable increase in both ambient (0.9–4.1 °C) and root-zone temperatures (1.1–1.6 °C) especially during the periods without sunlight compared to a conventional greenhouse. Machine learning algorithms used in this study include Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Hyperparameter tuning was performed for all three models to control model complexity, flexibility, learning rate, and regularization level, thereby preventing overfitting and underfitting. Among these algorithms, R2 values for testing data listed from largest to smallest are MARS (0.95), SVR (0.96), and XGBoost (0.97), respectively. The results emphasize the potential of machine learning approaches for applying thermal energy storage systems to agricultural greenhouses. In addition, it provides insight into a net-zero energy greenhouse approach by storing heat in a bio-based PCM, alongside its implementation and operational procedures.", "source":

{"id": "science_arxiv_cs_a34dbe02f8c9", "title": "FuseCodec: Semantic", "content": "arXiv:2509.11425v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks.

{"id": "industry_intelligence_fast_company_980a8bfca739", "title": "What are the 2 categories of AI use and why do they matter?", "content": "Generative AI is evolving along two distinct tracks: on one side, savvy users are building their own retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, personal agents, or even small language models (SLMs) tailored to their contexts and data. On the other, the majority are content with “LLMs out of the box”: Open a page, type a query, copy the output, paste it elsewhere. That divide — between builders and consumers — is shaping not only how AI is used but also whether it delivers value at all. The difference is not just individual skill. It’s also organizational. Companies are discovering that there are two categories of AI use: the administrative (summarize a report, draft a memo, produce boilerplate code) and the strategic (deploy agentic systems to automate functions, replace SaaS applications, and transform workflows). The first is incremental. The second is disruptive. But right now, the second is mostly failing. Why 95% of pilots fail The Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently found that 95% of corporate GenAI pilots fail. The reason? Most organizations are avoiding “friction”: They want drop-in replacements that work seamlessly, without confronting the hard questions of data governance, integration, and control. This pattern is consistent with the Gartner Hype Cycle: an initial frenzy of expectations followed by disillusionment as the technology proves more complex, messy, and political than promised. Why are so many projects failing? Because large language models from the big platforms are black boxes. Their training data is opaque, their biases unexplained, their outputs increasingly influenced by hidden incentives. Already, there are companies advertising “SEO for GenAI algorithms” or even “Answer Engine Optimization,” or AEO: optimizing content not for truth, but to game the invisible criteria of a model’s output. The natural endpoint is hallucinations and sponsored answers disguised as objectivity. How will you know if an LLM recommends a product because it’s correct, or because someone paid for it to be recommended? For organizations, that lack of transparency is fatal. You cannot build mission-critical processes on systems whose reasoning is unknowable and whose answers may be monetized without disclosure. From “out of the box” to “personal assistant” The trajectory for savvy users is clear. They are moving from using LLMs as is toward building personal assistants: systems that know their context, remember their preferences, and integrate with their tools. That shift introduces a corporate headache known as shadow AI: employees bringing their own models and agents into the workplace, outside of IT’s control. I argued in a recent piece, “BYOAI is a serious threat to your company,” that shadow AI is the new shadow IT. What happens when a brilliant hire insists on working with her own model, fine-tuned to her workflow? Do you ban it (and risk losing talent) or do you integrate it (and lose control)? What happens when she leaves and takes her personal agent, trained on your company’s data, with her? Who owns that knowledge? Corporate governance was designed for shared software and centralized systems. It was not designed for employees walking around with semiautonomous digital companions trained on proprietary data. SaaS under siege At the same time, companies are beginning to glimpse what comes next: agents that do not just sit alongside software as a service (SaaS); they replace it. With enterprise resource planning systems, you work for the software. With agents, the software works for you. Some companies are already testing the waters. Salesforce is reinventing itself through its Einstein 1 platform, effectively repositioning customer relationship management, or CRM, around agentic workflows. Klarna has announced it will shut down many SaaS providers and replace them with AI. Their first attempt may not succeed, but the direction is unmistakable: Agents are on a collision course with the subscription SaaS model. The key question is whether companies will build these platforms on black boxes they cannot control, or on open, auditable systems. Because the more strategic the use case, the higher the cost of opacity. Open source as the real answer This is why open source matters. If your future platform is an agent that automates workflows, manages sensitive data, and substitutes for your SaaS stack, can you really afford to outsource it to a system you cannot inspect? China provides a telling example. Despite being restricted from importing the most advanced chips, Chinese AI companies, under government pressure, have moved aggressively toward open-source models. The results are striking: They are catching up faster than many expected, precisely because the ecosystem is transparent, collaborative, and auditable. Open source has become their work-around for hardware limits, and also their engine of progress. For Western companies, the lesson is clear. Open source is not just about philosophy. It’s about sovereignty, reliability, and trust. The role of hybrid clouds Of course, there is still the question of where the data lives. Are companies comfortable uploading their proprietary knowledge into someone else’s black-box cloud? For many, the answer will increasingly be no. This is where hybrid cloud architectures become essential: They allow organizations to balance scale with governance, keeping sensitive workloads in environments they control while still accessing broader compute resources when needed. Hybrid approaches are not a panacea, but they are a pragmatic middle ground. They make it possible to experiment with agents, RAGs, and SLMs without surrendering your crown jewels to a black box. The way forward Generative AI is splitting in two directions. For the unsophisticated, it will remain a copy-and-paste tool: useful, incremental, but hardly transformative. For the sophisticated, it’s becoming a personal assistant. And for organizations, potentially, a full substitute for traditional software. But if companies want to make that leap from administrative uses to strategic ones, they must abandon the fantasy that black-box LLMs will carry them there. They won’t. The future of corporate AI belongs to those who insist on transparency, auditability, and sovereignty, which means building on open-source, not proprietary, opacity. Anything else is just renting intelligence you don’t control while your competitors are busy building agents that work for them, not for someone else’s business model.", "source": "industry_intelligence_fast_company", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/91422721/ai-use-two-categories-why-they-matter", "published_date": "2025-10-16T08:30:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-16T12:58:58.042072", "language": "en", "tags": ["technology", "innovation", "tech", "business"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Fast Company", "source_category": "industry_intelligence", "word_count": 998, "author": "Enrique Dans", "raw_content_length": 8473, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 4.99, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 6532, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["What", "the 2 categories", "AI use", "Generative AI", "two distinct tracks", "one side", "savvy users", "their own retrieval-augmented generation RAG pipelines", "personal agents", "even small language models"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["AI use"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"What": 2.0, "the 2 categories": 2.0, "AI use": 2.0, "Generative AI": 1.0, "two distinct tracks": 1.0, "one side": 1.0, "savvy users": 1.0, "their own retrieval-augmented generation RAG pipelines": 1.0, "personal agents": 1.0, "even small language models": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 4.559117355, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 0.7, "sentiment_score": 5.1290000000000004, "sentiment_category": "neutral", "sentiment_confidence": "low", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.0258, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": true, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.9362, "joy": 0.002, "surprise": 0.0175, "sadness": 0.003, "fear": 0.003, "anger": 0.0165, "disgust": 0.0218}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 5, "reasoning": "The article discusses AI use in organizations, mentioning pilot projects and early deployments of 'agentic systems'.

{"id": "science_mdpi_sustainability_3262351c8dc2", "title": "Sustainability, Vol. 17, Pages 8857: The Biosorption of Cadmium, Lead, and Arsenic Using Garlic Byproducts and Their Potential for Metal Immobilization in Soil", "content": "Metal contamination poses serious environmental and human health risks, which results in the need for low-cost remediation approaches. The utilization of agricultural byproducts for the removal of metal contaminants is considered cost-effective and environmentally sustainable. Garlic byproducts are rich in sulfur-containing compounds, and various functional groups contribute to metal binding. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of garlic stem and peel for the removal of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As) from aqueous solutions and for their immobilization in contaminated soils. Batch sorption experiments conducted at pH 7 for 24 h showed that garlic stem removed 71.5% of Cd and 70.8% of Pb, while garlic peel achieved 65.4% and 79.4% removal, respectively. The higher Pb removal by garlic peel might be attributed to its higher sulfur content. However, both byproducts were less effective in removing As(III) and showed negligible removal of As(V), as these species predominantly occur in neutral or negatively charged species at neutral pH, resulting in weak interactions with negatively charged surface functional groups. Soil incubation experiments were conducted using 1% and 5% amendments of garlic stem and peel in Pb- and As-contaminated soils. Extractable Pb concentrations significantly increased in soils treated with 1% garlic peel because of the formation of labile complexes of Pb with dissolved organic carbon. However, a column experiment to evaluate the impact on Pb mobility under saturated and unsaturated conditions showed that Pb concentration in soil pore water decreased with garlic stem. Pb concentration was lower under saturated conditions, possibly due to the precipitation of Pb as PbS. Although the short-term application of raw agricultural byproducts increased extractable metal concentrations, long-term incubation reduced Pb levels in pore water. These findings suggest that unmodified garlic stem is a promising, cost-effective amendment for Pb immobilization in soil. Nevertheless, caution is needed in its application to prevent unintended metal mobilization in soil.", "source": "science_mdpi_sustainability", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/19/8857", "published_date": "2025-10-03T00:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-03T12:49:42.400785", "language": "en", "tags": ["environment", "open-access", "sustainability", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Sustainability", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 308, "author": "Jin Hee Park", "raw_content_length": 2125, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 24, "reading_time_minutes": 1.54, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["The Biosorption of Cadmium", "Arsenic Using Garlic Byproducts", "Soil Metal", "Their Potential for Metal Immobilization"], "persons": [], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2125, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Sustainability", "Pages", "The Biosorption", "Cadmium", "Lead", "Arsenic", "Using Garlic Byproducts", "Their Potential", "Metal Immobilization", "Soil"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Sustainability"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Sustainability": 2.0, "Pages": 2.0, "The Biosorption": 2.0, "Cadmium": 2.0, "Lead": 2.0, "Arsenic": 2.0, "Using Garlic Byproducts": 2.0, "Their Potential": 2.0, "Metal Immobilization": 2.0, "Soil": 2.0}}, "age_hours": 12.9480242525, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 2.2885, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.5423, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 5, "reasoning": "The study describes lab experiments and soil incubation experiments.

{"id": "ai_engadget_e5024e4ce184", "title": "The Morning After: Amazon broke the internet (for a bit)", "content": "A decent-sized chunk of the internet stopped working after a fairly massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage. This included Venmo, Snapchat, Canva and Fortnite — even Amazon’s own products went on the fritz. Your humble narrator’s Ring Chimes started turning their night lights on and off entirely at random, with no prompting from yours truly. The company has already fixed the DNS issue that caused the outage, but a failure like this, which knocks out so damn much of the internet, should serve as a reminder. After all, having so many critical systems in the same basket means that when something goes wrong, a lot of the internet stops working.

Meta Ray-Ban Display review: Chunky frames with impressive abilities The next generation of smart glasses has arrived. Karissa Bell for Engadget It’s teeth-grindingly frustrating that Meta seems to be the company that has worked out how to make a truly transformative pair of smart glasses. Karissa Bell has reviewed its new Ray-Ban Display and has plenty of praise for so much of what it can do. You should read her exhaustive review to learn more, but the biggest barriers to adoption are size and price. But you can bet your bottom dollar the second or third generation of these are going to be a smash hit. At least until Meta gets rocked by another scandal that prompts people to deactivate their accounts. Continue Reading. Amazon reveals what one of the US’ first modular nuclear reactors will look like It’s an anonymous-looking warehouse. Amazon Last year, Amazon announced it would bankroll construction of a small nuclear reactor (SMR) plant in Washington state. Now, the company is showing off renders of the Hanford facility, which look like any other anonymous-looking modern warehouse. If you’re curious, the SMRs in question will use high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, each one with a maximum output of 80 megawatts. Continue Reading. Beats Powerbeats Fit review: Déjà vu, in a good way A few small tweaks add up to a nicer package. Valentina Palladino for Engadget Apple has updated the Beats Fit Pro with more flexible wingtips, a smaller charging case and the added benefits of Apple’s H1 chip. Valentina Palladino has been testing them out and can tell you the good, the bad and the ugly about these updated earbuds. And, if I’m honest, there’s not much that’s bad or ugly about them. Maybe the battery life could be a bit longer. Continue Reading. Apple is the new home for F1 in the US starting in 2026 It’s a pretty sweet deal given what’s thrown in. Apple In what can only be described as the least surprising sports rights streaming TV deal ever, Apple TV is the new home of F1 in the US. The five-year pact starts next year, with every practice, qualifying, sprint and race streaming live on Apple TV. Even better is that F1’s own excellent streaming platform, F1 TV Premium, will be a free perk for Apple TV subscribers. Continue Reading. Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd gen) review: Impactful upgrades to a familiar formula Sony finally has a worthy rival. Billy Steele for Engadget Bose opted for evolution over revolution for its 2025 series of QuietComfort Ultra products and is garnering rave reviews. Billy Steele is effusive with praise, calling them “the best noise canceling headphones you can buy right now.” It looks as if someone has finally been able to lay a finger on Sony’s previously imperious XM series, even if Bose’s glossy finish is a bit much. Continue Reading. Samsung Galaxy S25 FE review: Iterative to a fault A swing and a miss for Samsung. Igor Bonafacic for Engadget Samsung follows each flagship phone launch with a Fan Edition, which trims the spec list to get the price down. Igor Bonifacic has reviewed the S25 FE and found a phone designed for an older paradigm, before cheaper rivals like the Nothing 3a Pro and Pixel 10 came along. His recommendation? Buy last year’s full-fat model during a sale and swerve the compromises.

{"id": "ai_engadget_1b64634627ff", "title": "How to buy (and try) the Meta Ray", "content": "Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses are now on sale, but actually buying a pair will be a bit more complicated than ordering a pair of Meta's other smart glasses. That's because Meta isn't allowing online sales of its display glasses. Instead, they are only available by reservation at a handful of physical retail stores. For now, the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are available at select Ray-Ban, Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters and Best Buy locations in the United States. Verizon will also start carrying the glasses sometime \"soon,\" according to Meta. The company will also allow people to demo and buy a pair at its own Meta Lab locations. These include the Burlingame, California space that opened as the \"Meta Store\" in 2022, as well as pop-ups in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York opening in the coming weeks. In order to actually get your hands on a pair, though, you'll need to book an appointment for a demo at one of these stores through Meta's website. According to Meta, this is \"to make sure customers get the glasses and band that‚Äôs perfect for them.\" (In my own experience with both the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses and the Orion prototype, the neural wristband requires a snug fit to function properly.) An appointment will also give shoppers the opportunity to order prescription lenses for the glasses. The glasses only support a prescription range of -4.00 to +4.00, though, so they won't be compatible with all prescriptions. The company recently said it's seen \"strong\" demand for demos and it looks like most locations are already booked out for several weeks, judging by Meta's scheduling website. It will also be difficult if you don't live near a major city. For example, Sunglass Hut's website currently lists just seven locations where demos will be available. The good news is that Meta does plan to eventually increase availability. The company has said the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses will be available in Canada, France, Italy and the UK beginning in \"early 2026\" and that it expects buying options will \"expand\" the longer they're on sale. Sales of the glasses, which are Meta's first to incorporate a heads-up display, will be closely watched. At $799, the glasses are significantly more expensive than the rest of the frames in Meta's expanding lineup of \"AI glasses.\" But, as I wrote after my recent demo at Meta Connect, the display also enables wearers to do much more than what's currently possible with the existing Ray-Ban or Oakley models.

{"id": "ai_engadget_bf95a2404168", "title": "The Morning After: Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy XR enters the chat", "content": "This week, Samsung showed off Galaxy XR, its Vision Pro-troubling headset, and you can bet we‚Äôve done a deep dive. Sam Rutherford got one of these strapped to his head and has plenty of feelings about the new hardware. The headset is lighter, more comfortable and easier to live with than Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro, even if it lacks many of its headline features. The software ecosystem is already pretty broad, thanks to Google making a real effort with Android XR, but dedicated apps are still a bit rare. Samsung‚Äôs entry into the market might provide some much-needed impetus for this type of augmented reality headset. That it‚Äôs half the price of Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro may also loosen some wallets eager to get into this world. But it‚Äôs hard not to see this as Samsung running down the same cul-de-sac Apple is now lurking at the end of. It has allowed other companies, like Meta, to waltz in and grab an early lead in the much more useful smart glasses market. ‚Äî Dan Cooper Get Engadget's newsletter delivered direct to your inbox.

Apple MacBook Pro M5 14-inch review: A huge graphics upgrade for creators and gamers The GPU is the star here. Devindra Hardawar for Engadget Apple‚Äôs online-only announcement of the new vanilla M5 MacBooks might have been a sign the new models were no big deal. But Devindra Hardawar found these were, in fact, quite a big deal, and the M5‚Äôs faster GPU has the chops to go toe-to-toe with a gaming PC. Continue Reading. Toyota‚Äôs new all-hybrid RAV4 has software you might actually want to use It wants to offer a better alternative to your smartphone. Tim Stevens for Engadget Toyota isn‚Äôt happy folks just default to CarPlay or Android Auto for their in-car infotainment. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs chosen to radically redesign its OS for the 2026 RAV4 to include voice and touch control. Tim Stevens has ridden the new whip and has plenty of opinions on whether it‚Äôs worth your time or, you know‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll just default to CarPlay or Android Auto.

Nathan Ingraham for Engadget As much as I may want an iPad Pro, it wouldn‚Äôt play a role in my life that would get anywhere near to justifying its extortionate price. Consequently, I shall just live vicariously through Nathan Ingraham, who reviewed the M5 edition and found it to be a work of art. But, you know, it has a price so eye-watering that nobody who‚Äôs on the fence about owning one should bother. Then, Nate pivoted to writing about how the iPad Pro has, at least, carved out its own identity. Continue Reading.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao lands a Trump pardon Nothing to see here, move along. Maybe there‚Äôs nothing interesting about the fact Changpeng Zhao was just pardoned by President Trump despite pleading guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act. I mean, yes, Zhao has ties to World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture linked to the Trump family. But that‚Äôs not uncommon, is it? Surely everyone would use the privilege of high office to exonerate people with whom they potentially have fruitful relationships. Right? Continue Reading.

Het gaat om kinderen die \"complexe hoog-specialistische zorg nodig hebben, die in direct levensgevaar verkeren en waarvoor nu in de regio geen onmiddellijke hulp beschikbaar is.\" De beoordeling van welke kinderen daarvoor in aanmerking komen, is mede in handen van de Wereldgezondheidsorganisatie (WHO). Het kabinet gaat ook af op de kennis en ervaring van Europese landen die eerder kinderen hebben opgenomen voor medische behandelingen. \"Het aantal gevallen dat Nederland zal kunnen en gaat opnemen zal overigens zeer beperkt zijn\", stelt Van Weel. Er zal ook rekening worden gehouden met de beschikbare zorgcapaciteit voor Nederlandse kinderen. Het kabinet maakte eerder bekend dat er 25 miljoen euro gaat naar (medische) noodhulp in de regio voor mensen uit de Gazastrook. Dit gaat via de WHO onder meer naar Egypte, Save the Children, Dutch Relief Alliance, Unicef en het Rode Kruis. Vier keer motie verworpen Verschillende partijen in de Tweede Kamer dringen al maanden aan op de medische behandeling voor ernstig zieke kinderen in Nederland. Tot vier keer toe dienden zij er moties over in, die steeds nipt werden verworpen. Gisteren gebeurde dat nog met 72 stemmen voor en 74 tegen. Het kabinet ging tot nu niet in op de wens van bijna de helft van de Kamerleden. Ook nu benadrukt Van Weel dat behandeling in de regio het uitgangspunt blijft. Toch niet in regio Demissionair premier Schoof zegt dat het kabinet tot nu toe \"de veronderstelling had\" dat de zorg wel in de regio geboden kon worden, al beweerden veel hulporganisaties het tegendeel. \"Wij moesten eerst zelf tot die conclusie komen\", legt hij uit: \"De druk op het kabinet om dit wél te gaan doen is cruciaal geweest\", zegt SP-Kamerlid Dobbe. In de Kamer wordt verheugd gereageerd op de toezegging van het kabinet. \"Goed dat het kabinet eindelijk gehoor geeft aan de lange roep vanuit de Kamer\", zegt D66-leider Jetten. \"Eindelijk een teken van medemenselijkheid\", zegt Kamerlid Piri van GL-PvdA. Ook bijvoorbeeld VVD en SGP, die eerder tegen de moties stemden, zijn het eens met het kabinet omdat het gaat om een beperkt aantal kinderen die echt niet in de regio kunnen worden geholpen. Duizenden kinderen uit Gaza zijn geëvacueerd naar Egypte, maar daar kunnen ze niet altijd geholpen worden:", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2584873", "published_date": "2025-10-02T07:52:26", "collected_date": "2025-10-02T12:47:46.256322", "language": "nl", "tags": ["mainstream", "nederland", "dutch_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "NOS Nieuws", "source_category": "dutch_news", "word_count": 411, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 2849, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 2.055, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Tweede Kamer", "WHO"], "persons": [], "locations": ["Gaza", "Nederland"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2561, "language_detected": "nl", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Kabinet", "zieke kinderen", "Gaza", "kinderen", "die", "Het demissionaire kabinet", "een medische behandeling", "Het kabinet", "enkele kinderen", "minister"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["Het demissionaire kabinet"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Kabinet": 2.0, "zieke kinderen": 2.0, "Gaza": 2.0, "kinderen": 2.0, "die": 2.0, "Het demissionaire kabinet": 1.0, "een medische behandeling": 1.0, "Het kabinet": 1.0, "enkele kinderen": 1.0, "minister": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 5.018576218055555, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 0.842, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.8316, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 3, "reasoning": "This is a pilot program to bring a very limited number of children to the Netherlands for medical treatment.

{"id": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen_bf593af86da8", "title": "Mei Li Vos (GL", "content": "De Eerste Kamer heeft een nieuwe voorzitter. Mei Li Vos (GroenLinks-PvdA) is door een meerderheid van de senaat gekozen. Ze is de opvolger van Jan Anthonie Bruijn (VVD), die onlangs minister van Volksgezondheid werd in het demissionaire kabinet. Sinds zijn vertrek fungeerde Vos al als tijdelijk voorzitter van de Eerste Kamer. Er waren drie kandidaten: naast Vos kon de Kamer kiezen voor Ilona Lagas, de fractievoorzitter van BBB, en Tanja Klip-Martin van de VVD. Na de eerste stemronde trok Lagas zich terug. Zij kreeg 14 van de 75 stemmen. De tweede ronde ging daardoor tussen Vos en Klip-Martin. Daarbij haalde Vos 39 stemmen en Klip-Martin 33. Drie senatoren stemden blanco. Tweede poging De 55-jarige Vos zit sinds 2019 in de Eerste Kamer en was tot vandaag vicevoorzitter van haar fractie. Twee jaar geleden deed ze ook al een gooi naar het voorzitterschap van de senaat. Toen verloor ze van Bruijn, die toen al voorzitter was. Eerder was Vos Tweede Kamerlid voor de PvdA. Voor haar politieke carrière was ze ambtenaar op het ministerie van Algemene Zaken. Ook was ze een van de oprichters van Alternatief voor Vakbond, uit onvrede over het beleid van de FNV. 'Zoveel tijd als nodig' Nadat de uitslag bekend was, zei Vos dat ze \"heel aangenaam verbaasd\" was door de steun. Ze beloofde als voorzitter neutraal te zijn en \"nooit onderwerp te worden van politiek debat\". In haar motivatie om voorzitter te worden, stelde ze dat ze niet zal nalaten \"om de regering en de Tweede Kamer eraan te herinneren dat wij zoveel tijd nemen als wij nodig achten\". De Eerste Kamer heeft als taak om wetten die door de Tweede Kamer zijn aangenomen nog eens tegen het licht te houden. Het demissionaire kabinet wil het liefst de aangescherpte asielwetten voor de verkiezingen door de Eerste en Tweede Kamer loodsen, maar het is de vraag of dat lukt. Wat doet de voorzitter van de Eerste Kamer? Als voorzitter leidt Vos de plenaire vergaderingen van de senaat. Die zijn normaal gesproken elke dinsdag. Ze leidt ook het College van fractievoorzitters en het College van Voorzitter en Ondervoorzitters dat toezicht houdt op de bedrijfsvoering van de Kamer. Op Prinsjesdag is de voorzitter van de Eerste Kamer voorzitter van de Verenigde Vergadering met de Tweede Kamer. Vos zal de Eerste Kamer ook vertegenwoordigen in contacten met buitenlandse parlementen en staatshoofden. Eerste Kamerlid is een betaalde bijbaan met een vergoeding van bruto 37.000 euro per jaar. De voorzitter krijgt een hoger salaris, dat is gebaseerd op een halve werkweek. Mei Li Vos geeft naast haar werk in Den Haag ook nog les op een basisschool. Ze is van plan dat te blijven doen.", "source": "dutch_news_nos_algemeen", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://nos.nl/l/2585575", "published_date": "2025-10-07T14:50:14", "collected_date": "2025-10-07T18:37:34.062964", "language": "nl", "tags": ["mainstream", "nederland", "dutch_news"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "NOS Nieuws", "source_category": "dutch_news", "word_count": 443, "author": null, "raw_content_length": 2998, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 2.215, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Klip-Martin", "Eerste Kamer", "senaat", "VVD"], "persons": ["Mei Li Vos", "Drie", "Ilona Lagas", "Klip-Martin 33.", "Jan Anthonie", "Bruijn", "Vos Tweede"], "locations": [], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 2645, "language_detected": "nl", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["een nieuwe voorzitter", "een meerderheid", "de senaat", "die", "minister", "Volksgezondheid", "het demissionaire kabinet", "zijn vertrek", "tijdelijk voorzitter", "kandidaten"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["het demissionaire kabinet"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"een nieuwe voorzitter": 1.0, "een meerderheid": 1.0, "de senaat": 1.0, "die": 1.0, "minister": 1.0, "Volksgezondheid": 1.0, "het demissionaire kabinet": 1.0, "zijn vertrek": 1.0, "tijdelijk voorzitter": 1.0, "kandidaten": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 3.8920634344444442, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 1.2850000000000001, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "high", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.743, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "raw_emotions": {"neutral": 0.7948, "joy": 0.0205, "surprise": 0.0972, "sadness": 0.0245, "fear": 0.0182, "anger": 0.0258, "disgust": 0.019}, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 1, "reasoning": "This article is about a political appointment, not a climate technology deployment.

{"id": "ai_engadget_c7b706ec555d", "title": "Anker's latest Prime charging devices are already on sale", "content": "Anker has a bunch of new Prime charging devices available and some of them are already getting solid discounts. The lineup includes a laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W). The device's Amazon page currently features a clippable coupon that will take $46 off the price, reducing it by 20 percent. That means you'll be able to snap this powerbank up for $184. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker powerbank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs — the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger — which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously — also gets a 20 percent discount to $184 when you use a clippable coupon. While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is 20 percent off too, at $120 with a clippable coupon. Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable. The charger is said to offer smart power distribution, and you can monitor what's happening and adjust modes via an onboard display and controls.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-latest-prime-charging-devices-are-already-on-sale-152040769.html?src=rss", "source": "ai_engadget", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/deals/ankers-latest-prime-charging-devices-are-already-on-sale-152040769.html?src=rss", "published_date": "2025-09-29T15:35:46", "collected_date": "2025-09-29T18:39:56.767305", "language": "en", "tags": ["consumer", "regionus", "siteengadget", "headline", "gadgets", "author_namekris_holt", "technology", "languageen-us"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics", "source_category": "ai", "word_count": 411, "author": "Kris Holt", "raw_content_length": 6675, "priority": 6, "update_frequency": 6, "reading_time_minutes": 2.055, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["USB", "Prime Power Bank", "Anker", "Amazon"], "persons": ["Anker"], "locations": [], "monetary": ["184"]}, "char_count": 2414, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["Ankers latest Prime charging devices", "sale", "Anker", "a bunch", "new Prime charging devices", "some", "them", "solid discounts", "The lineup", "a laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank"], "filter_categories": {}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"Ankers latest Prime charging devices": 2.0, "sale": 2.0, "Anker": 2.0, "a bunch": 1.0, "new Prime charging devices": 1.0, "some": 1.0, "them": 1.0, "solid discounts": 1.0, "The lineup": 1.0, "a laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 3.304832872222222, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 6.591, "sentiment_category": "positive", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": 0.3182, "is_positive": true, "is_negative": false, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "api"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 8, "reasoning": "These are commercially available products being sold on Amazon.

Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction performances.", "source": "science_arxiv_cs", "source_type": "rss", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01799", "published_date": "2025-10-03T04:00:00", "collected_date": "2025-10-03T06:37:44.141165", "language": "en", "tags": ["computer-science", "astro-phsr", "research", "astro-phim", "preprints", "cslg", "physicsspace-ph", "science"], "metadata": {"feed_title": "cs updates on arXiv.org", "source_category": "science", "word_count": 115, "author": "Chiara Curletto, Paolo Massa, Valeria Tagliafico, Cristina Campi, Federico Benvenuto, Michele Piana, Andrea Tacchino", "raw_content_length": 831, "priority": 7, "update_frequency": 1, "reading_time_minutes": 0.575, "robust_parsing_used": true, "entities": {"organizations": ["Coronal Mass Ejections"], "persons": ["arXiv:2510.01799v1 Announce Type"], "locations": ["Earth"], "monetary": []}, "char_count": 830, "language_detected": "en", "key_concepts": {"key_phrases": ["PRESOL", "a web", "which", "Announce Type", "cross", "Solar flares", "the most explosive phenomena", "the solar system", "the main trigger", "the events chain"], "filter_categories": {"ai_ml": ["the main trigger"]}, "extraction_method": "spacy", "confidence": "high", "concept_scores": {"PRESOL": 2.0, "a web": 2.0, "which": 2.0, "Announce Type": 1.0, "cross": 1.0, "Solar flares": 1.0, "the most explosive phenomena": 1.0, "the solar system": 1.0, "the main trigger": 1.0, "the events chain": 1.0}}, "age_hours": 2.822052194722222, "is_recent": true, "quality_score": 1.0, "sentiment_score": 3.9884999999999997, "sentiment_category": "negative", "sentiment_confidence": "medium", "sentiment_method": "vader", "sentiment_raw_score": -0.2023, "is_positive": false, "is_negative": true, "is_neutral": false, "heartwarming_score": 0, "uplifting_score": 0, "inspiring_score": 0, "is_heartwarming": false, "is_uplifting": false, "is_inspiring": false, "emotion_method": "local"}, "sustainability_tech_deployment_analysis": {"deployment_maturity": {"score": 5, "reasoning": "The platform is web-based and provides predictions, suggesting early commercial deployment.
