> As homes across India flicker to life this Diwali, millions celebrate the light they already have. But in the forgotten folds of the country, that light is still being fought for — one solar panel, one wire, one dream at a time. In villages where the grid never arrived, lamps don’t just brighten rooms; they guard children walking home, power a farmer’s pump, and give women the freedom to work past sunset. This is the story of those who turned the sun into survival — the engineers, students, and communities who refused to let darkness decide their lives. 1. Manipur: When a loom hums after dusk In Manipur’s misty hills, evenings once ended livelihoods. Power looms fell silent, and children turned to the dull glow of kerosene lamps. That changed when Seth Moirangthem, a graduate who spent years working with non-profits, founded SNL Energy Solutions in 2019 to bring solar power to villages off the grid. Seth’s solar systems now light 1,000 homes in Manipur’s hills, helping weavers, potters and students work past sunset. A 40-watt panel that lights a three-room home costs around Rs 18,000; larger 1-kW systems keep power looms and sewing machines running through the night. “Solar

**Content**:

> arXiv:1907.13436v5 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Quantum gravity (or quantum spacetime) is to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single theoretical framework and presented as the most important open puzzle in fundamental physics. The development of a microscopic theory of quantum spacetime becomes the key problem about quantum gravity. This paper is the solution to this problem. The starting point of this paper is very simple -- physical variant with higher-order variability (see the below discussion). Based on this simple starting point, a microscopic theory for quantum spacetime is developed, including its matrix representation for quantum states, its time evolution, its geometry quantization, its generalized symmetry, its canonical quantization, and the uncertainty principle, black hole, AdS/CFT correspondence, scattering amplitudes of gravitons... The result leads to a great unification of matter and spacetime -- the particles constitute the basic blocks of spacetime and spacetime is really a multi-particle system that is made of matter. As a result, this work would help researchers to understand the mysteries in quantum gravity.

**Overall Analysis Reasoning**:

The paper presents a potential solution to a major problem in fundamental physics, quantum gravity, aiming to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. This unification could lead to a deeper understanding of the universe, with the potential to revolutionize our understanding of matter, spacetime, and related phenomena, benefiting all of humanity through expanded knowledge.

**Content**:

> arXiv:2505.03335v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.

**Content**:

> arXiv:2510.03240v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Innovation ecosystems require careful policy stewardship to drive sustained advance in human health, welfare, security and prosperity. We develop new measures that reliably decompose the influence of innovations in terms of the degree to which each represents a field-level foundation, an extension of foundational work, or a generalization that synthesizes and modularizes contributions from distant fields to catalyze combinatorial innovation. Using 23 million scientific works from OpenAlex and 19 million works from Web of Science, we demonstrate that while foundational and extensional work within fields has declined in recent years-a trend garnering much recent attention-generalizations across fields have increased and accelerated with the rise of the web, social media, and artificial intelligence, shifting the locus of innovation from within fields to across the system as a whole. We explore implications for science policy.

**Overall Analysis Reasoning**:

The article describes a shift in innovation towards generalizations across fields, catalyzed by the web, social media, and AI. This cross-field synthesis has the potential to drive sustained advances in human health, welfare, security, and prosperity by fostering combinatorial innovation and addressing complex problems from multiple perspectives.

**Title**: Steering Embedding Models with Geometric Rotation: Mapping Semantic Relationships Across Languages and Models

**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09790

**Published**: 2025-10-14T04:00:00

**Content**:

> arXiv:2510.09790v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' + ''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations. RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features (e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level.

**Overall Analysis Reasoning**:

Researchers have developed a method (RISE) to understand and map semantic transformations across languages and models. This allows for consistent geometric operations in multilingual embedding spaces, supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis at the sentence level and potentially enabling better cross-lingual understanding and communication.

**URL**: https://nos.nl/l/2586276

**Published**: 2025-10-13T04:00:02

**Content**:

> De afgelopen anderhalf jaar hebben de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten elf verdachten uitgeleverd aan Nederland, terwijl daarvoor zelden iemand werd overgedragen. Criminelen in Dubai worden nerveus, merkt het Openbaar Ministerie. Jarenlang konden Nederlandse criminelen ongestoord een luxeleven leiden in de emiraten. Vele tientallen verdachten hielden zich schuil in Dubai, buiten het bereik van justitie in Nederland. Terwijl ze vanuit het Midden-Oosten per versleutelde telefoon cocaïnetransporten organiseerden, deelden drugshandelaren met hetzelfde gemak opdrachten uit voor liquidaties in Nederland. Hun geld staken ze in dure auto's, luxe appartementen en uitspattingen in het nachtleven van Dubai. Deze Arabische vrijhaven was Nederland een doorn in het oog. Daarom kwamen er gesprekken over officiële rechtshulp met de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten en werd uiteindelijk in 2023 een uitleveringsverdrag van kracht. Vorig jaar werden de eerste drie verdachten overhandigd, dit jaar tot nu toe acht. "Dit is geen piek, maar de nieuwe trend", stelt officier van justitie Ferry van Veghel van het Landelijk Parket, dat regelmatig om uitlevering vraagt van verdachten in de emiraten. Drugshandel Eerder moest de overheid nog lang onderhandelen om Nederlands meest gezochte verdachte Ridouan Taghi hierheen te krijgen. Maar inmiddels zijn de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten criminelen liever kwijt dan rijk en vliegen ze er achter elkaar uit. Onder de nu uitgeleverde elf zijn verdachten van zware georganiseerde criminaliteit, zoals drugshandel en witwassen. Voorbeelden zijn een zoon van Taghi, voetballer Quincy Promes, de Delftse rapper Fatah en een ondergrondse bankier die miljoenen zou hebben verplaatst voor criminelen. "Maar ook verdachten in zaken die misschien van minder gewicht lijken, zoals cybercrime of fraude met cryptovaluta", zegt Van Veghel. "Omdat heel duidelijk moet zijn dat wat je ook gepleegd hebt, naar Dubai gaan betekent niet meer dat je buiten schot blijft." Verdachten die nog op het lijstje van het OM staan om uitgeleverd te worden zijn onder andere de Bredase drugsbaron Edin G., een gewelddadige Eritrese mensenhandelaar en een man die naar Dubai is gevlucht na het veroorzaken van een dodelijk verkeersongeval in Lelystad. Geduld Eerder was de procedure ondoorzichtig en onvoorspelbaar. Inmiddels weet het Openbaar Ministerie beter hoe een uitleveringsverzoek onderbouwd moet worden. Sinds dit jaar zit er een Nederlandse officier van justitie in de emiraten om de samenwerking te bevorderen. Toch blijft uitleveren een oefening in geduld. De procedure kan zomaar een jaar tot anderhalf jaar duren, zoals blijkt uit de zaak rond Promes. Lang bleef onduidelijk of hij hier zijn straf zou gaan uitzitten. Net als in Nederland, kan een verdachte zich verzetten tegen uitlevering en in beroep gaan tegen een beslissing van de rechter. Uiteindelijk moet de minister van Justitie beslissen. Hoewel het OM nu meer te horen krijgt over het verloop van een procedure, blijft het vaak een verrassing wanneer een verdachte daadwerkelijk kan worden opgehaald. Wie zich niet verzet tegen uitlevering, kan tegenwoordig snel in Nederland zijn. Dat bewees de arrestatie van vlogger Alex Soze, die hier nog een gevangenisstraf open heeft staan voor geweld en op sociale media koketteerde met zijn verblijf in Dubai. In augustus werd hij op verzoek van Nederland opgepakt, een paar weken later was hij hier. Deal sluiten Nog altijd zitten er vermoedelijk tientallen Nederlandse verdachten in de Verenigde Arabische Emiraten. Die beginnen zenuwachtig te worden, merkt het OM. "Het is een plek waar het goed toeven is en tot op heden misschien ook heel veilig voelde", zegt Van Veghel. "Ik denk wel dat dat echt voorbij is." Het OM zegt steeds vaker te worden gebeld door advocaten van verdachten in Dubai, die procesafspraken willen maken met justitie om hier een straf uit te zitten. "Dat verdachten nu zelf contact opnemen om naar Nederland terug te komen, bewijst voor ons wel dat ze zich niet langer veilig wanen." Er zijn ook verdachten die inmiddels uit Dubai zijn vertrokken omdat het hen er te heet onder de voeten werd. Er gaan zelfs verhalen over criminelen die verborgen in zeecontainers de emiraten ontvluchten. Marokko De vraag is waar ze dan naartoe gaan; buiten bereik van justitie maar waar ze het ook breed kunnen laten hangen. Drugsbaron Jos L. houdt zich al een tijd schuil in West-Afrika, nadat hij eerder Turkije al verliet. Andere verdachten kiezen voor Marokko, dat geen eigen onderdanen uitlevert. "Wij kijken voortdurend wat nou interessante landen zijn voor criminelen om zich te vestigen", zegt officier van justitie Van Veghel. "Maar ook om hun geld onder te brengen of bepaalde geldstromen doorheen te laten lopen. Dat zijn landen waar we dan proberen afspraken mee te maken, net zoals we dat met Dubai hebben gedaan." Op dit moment is Nederland bezig om ook met Marokko een uitleveringsverdrag te sluiten, zodat Nederlandse verdachten ook daar niet langer veilig zijn.

**Overall Analysis Reasoning**:

Dutch authorities are actively working to bring criminals to justice, disrupting their ability to operate with impunity. This action provides a safer environment for the broader community and demonstrates progress towards accountability for past wrongdoings, potentially deterring future criminal activity. There is increased connection between the Netherlands and the UAE to facilitate this.

She explained to Sunita Shivkumar of the Mumbai-based NGO Making The Difference — which, in 2024, was surveying Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli tribal belt to understand the community’s challenges — that she used cloth to manage her menstrual bleeding. Sunita felt a momentary relief — at least cloth was more hygienic than the leaves and ash that the older women of the tribe used. But her relief was short-lived. Pinky revealed that for most periods, she used the same cloth for days, changing it only if her husband managed to bring fresh ones and leave them outside the kurma ghar, where she and other menstruating women were confined. Same with food. If someone brought it, they ate. If not, they went hungry. These parables are grounded in the traditions that persist in tribal pockets of Maharashtra, especially among Gadchiroli’s Gond and Madiya communities.

**Title**: Judging with Confidence: Calibrating Autoraters to Preference Distributions

**URL**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00263

**Published**: 2025-10-02T04:00:00

**Content**:

> arXiv:2510.00263v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However, their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions: 1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

#### Overall Analysis Reasoning

The research aims to improve the reliability of AI judges used to align language models with human values. By modeling the full distribution of preferences, the AI can better reflect nuanced and subjective opinions, leading to more accurate and fair assessments. This benefits the development of AI systems that are more aligned with diverse human perspectives.

**Content**:

> A political scientist who studies what helps people connect across differences. A novelist whose books about Native American communities in Oakland, California, sparked a passionate following. A photographer whose black and white images investigate poverty in America. Hahrie Han, Tommy Orange, and Matt Black are among the 22 fellows selected this year by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and announced Wednesday. It’s a recognition often called the “genius award,” which comes with an $800,000 prize, paid over five years that fellows can spend however they choose. The foundation selects fellows over the course of years, considering a vast range of recommendations, largely from their peers. “Each class doesn’t have a theme and we’re not creating a cohort around a certain idea,” said Marlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows program. “But I think this year, we see empathy and deep engagement with community figures prominently in this class.” Through different methodologies, many of the fellows “boldly and unflinchingly” reflect what they see and hear from deep engagement with their communities, she said. Because fellows don’t apply or participate in any way in their selection, the award often comes as a shock and sometimes coincides with difficult moments.

**Content**:

> In Haralahalli, a small village in Karnataka, a man lives among shelves that rise like walls. At 75, Anke Gowda has spent more than five decades building a private library that now holds nearly two million books. He calls it Pustaka Mane — the Book House. Its door stays open to anyone who loves to read. His journey did not begin with privilege. As a young bus conductor, he saved every spare rupee while pursuing a master’s degree in Kannada literature. A professor introduced him to the world of books and kindled in him a lifelong passion for learning. That spark grew into a purpose — and over the years, into a home built on words. Home is where the books are Gowda’s commitment to books went beyond mere admiration. He poured every spare rupee into his collection, often giving up small comforts along the way. His devotion grew so absolute that he eventually sold his house in Mysuru, choosing instead to live among the very books he had collected. Today, he dwells inside the library itself, named Pustaka Mane (Book House) — with his wife Vijayalakshmi and son Sagar, both of whom are devoted to his cause. Their daily life unfolds in a humble corner of the library, surrounded by volumes that span centuries, civilisations, and disciplines. At 75, Anke Gowda has spent more than five decades building a private library A treasure open to everyone Pustaka Mane is more than a personal collection — it is his gift to the world. The library’s doors stay open to anyone eager to learn. Over the years, schoolchildren, research scholars, civil service aspirants, writers, and even judges of the Supreme Court have stepped inside in search of knowledge. The shelves hold books in over 20 languages, spanning Indian vernaculars and foreign tongues alike. The range is astonishing — classical literature, ancient philosophy, science, technology, poetry, and rare manuscripts. Among its most prized holdings are 500,000 rare foreign titles and over 5,000 multilingual dictionaries, some dating back to the early 19th century. In its early years, the growing collection was stored in bags and corners of rooms. As it expanded, support from well-wishers helped give it a more permanent home. Industrialist Sri Hari Khoday came forward to build a larger structure, ensuring that this vast archive could be preserved and shared safely for generations to come. Beyond walls and shelves For Gowda, collecting books has never been the ultimate goal. His dream is larger: to turn Pustaka Mane into a living centre of learning, where anyone can explore ideas freely, without barriers or commercial interests. The shelves hold books in over 20 languages, spanning Indian vernaculars and foreign tongues alike Even at 75, he continues to personally clean, organise, and catalogue the books, thousands of which still await sorting. The challenge of digitisation looms large, and funding remains limited. But he is undeterred. In a world driven by distraction and speed, Gowda offers a dignified counterpoint. From his small village in Karnataka, he has created not just a library, but a sanctuary for learning — open to all, asking for nothing but curiosity.

> Pinky went silent when asked, “Do you have access to sanitary pads?” Having never used one, she didn’t know what they were. She explained to Sunita Shivkumar of the Mumbai-based NGO Making The Difference — which, in 2024, was surveying Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli tribal belt to understand the community’s challenges — that she used cloth to manage her menstrual bleeding. Sunita felt a momentary relief — at least cloth was more hygienic than the leaves and ash that the older women of the tribe used. But her relief was short-lived. Pinky revealed that for most periods, she used the same cloth for days, changing it only if her husband managed to bring fresh ones and leave them outside the kurma ghar, where she and other menstruating women were confined. Same with food. If someone brought it, they ate. If not, they went hungry. These parables are grounded in the traditions that persist in tribal pockets of Maharashtra, especially among Gadchiroli’s Gond and Madiya communities. Periods are still seen as a sin, menstruation as ungodly. And the punishment is banishment to the kurma ghars — cramped, thatched huts on the village fringes. These dingy dwellings lack doors, windows, or sanitation. Harsh winds,
