We evaluate state regulation of hospital mergers under Certificates of Public Advantage (COPAs). Using hospital data from 1996-2022, we compare COPA-regulated mergers to unregulated mergers with similar anticompetitive potential. In highly concentrated markets, COPA mergers result in 11.1 p.p. lower price growth but 0.5 p.p. greater increases in 30-day mortality rates. We find a negative correlation between price and mortality effects for COPA mergers, consistent with theoretical predictions that binding price caps exacerbate quality deterioration. Our findings suggest that COPA contracts are poor substitutes for traditional antitrust enforcement.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34373#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.696241","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.696270","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National

{"id":"economics_nber_working_papers_568fe5717e92","title":"Children Are Bridges to Heaven: The Effects of Fertility on Later-Life Mortality -","content":"Several competing theories in a number of disciplines point to a possible influence of fertility history on health and mortality. However, the direction of effects is theoretically a-priori unknown and the empirical evidence is also inconclusive. This paper examines the effects of fertility during midlife on later-life longevity using Social Security Administration death records linked with the full-count 1940 census. We tackle endogeneity and selection concerns in the longevity-fertility association by implementing an instrumental variable based on the sex composition of first two children. Our findings indicate that having an extra child is linked to a decrease in women’s longevity by approximately 5 months. Men, on the other hand, experience smaller and insignificant reductions in longevity of about 3.3 months. This divergence in effects suggests that biological factors may play a small role in the relationship between fertility and later-life longevity.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34378#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.697259","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.697290","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National Bureau of Economic Research Working Papers","source_category":"economics","word_count":141,"author":null,"raw_content_length":971,"priority":8,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.705,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Later-Life Mortality - Several","Social Security Administration"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":971,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Children","Bridges","Heaven","The Effects","Fertility","Later-Life Mortality","Several competing theories","a number","disciplines","a possible influence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Children":2.0,"Bridges":2.0,"Heaven":2.0,"The Effects":2.0,"Fertility":2.0,"Later-Life Mortality":2.0,"Several competing theories":1.0,"a number":1.0,"disciplines":1.0,"a possible influence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.0809974483333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"535eb9d206c934af72d1183a04db191e","title_md5":"f0d28dcffedf9830d3ee4e88671d7322","url_normalized":"89f67e00b532616be514d9717d96cc22","minhash_signature":["9837667","16221366","14366","13560711","18729664","4631126","19721531","2181150","693538","4729967","3139314","2763186","2343024","1166689","16595777","7389182","14171223","10786263","13951128","955784","1196901","88593","25690881","11641973","11424750","14410239","7507083","9327886","21074790","1456173","522500","6606854","18205745","9969046","1053967","16352021","10844376","5605276","7167732","30141695","4708391","3329444","33852562","1785966","39996494","2720336","1691750","20266055","1132398","16941830","24214257","843096","17357374","4194521","9983662","5146736","226173","6045037","4656097","1151625","2318646","19074674","1936","4050641","7601","13418347","21625977","1563117","7564697","4625726","7249981","1755940","15056664","4528274","7951082","2595826","269839","6134367","9506978","13381973","14672648","6491954","3972917","10833656","11728217","2319043","4602115","12075368","1442738","1755802","7521029","1254119","19499623","436779","12786202","11266958","1608076","479007","24302950","713149","1534879","13263583","4327830","7495224","1806145","16888711","2193094","12541577","12007630","6841584","1243296","120729","5520226","76161","756656","13776844","873230","1307835","6431271","12207048","1131087","7895850","25381733","363706","3829832","12563646","4653766","14026051"],"title_minhash":["24942206","66260777","4229889","52918094","46183253","34946918","85381145","93931466","148393289","40064675","43296864","77470861","10736429","58535784","24720415","7389182","42803213","48406674","28843053","38876791","6058284","5184937","54507159","11641973","42290639","34449760","84257291","139139768","47381118","1456173","3290860","16000752","81484603","34963712","7626088","27257070","28724667","380697209","158376087","72103261","66062348","59276361","115753605","16067791","50391278","22056152","168199762","32330908","239169219","35423699","135664802","8355167","17357374","7574389","25136413","13331872","132354965","32296567","123693004","8076200","67726972","27212162","1936","107800758","176369908","70272572","21803903","3973728","39322970","252598443","19680712","80825518","173035524","118429636","7951082","63642210","10923713","6134367","23400542","13381973","43882922","14255238","57336166","134183993","15871323","119197467","93403703","19829573","47091666","61481582","74938439","305974082","52246873","20217852","145369095","108646180","34934479","43573138","50107332","35832301","131824704","80026776","12477765","84762869","8090509","156615398","185958462","20554633","12007630","44001","38267602","55388461","95873764","107443661","40822438","28227271","46471986","1307835","52513354","58701966","19426395","76350134","188617325","363706","31202914","17430089","61576740","45227134"],"combined_hash":"e413bb54d47a6eb379ccb8d4656331fa"},"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.806,"joy":0.0113,"surprise":0.045,"sadness":0.0388,"fear":0.061,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0222},"emotion_method":"local"},"uplifting_analysis":{"content_type":"community_building","agency":2,"progress":3,"collective_benefit":4,"connection":1,"innovation":3,"justice":1,"resilience":2,"wonder":1,"reasoning":"This article presents research on the impact of fertility on longevity.

Designing an evidence structure entails both (i) front-end costs borne ex ante, such as those of drafting contracts, and (ii) back-end costs borne ex post, such as those of generating evidence. We find that, under even small front-end costs, optimal contracts are coarse, specifying finitely many contingencies out of a continuum of possibilities. In contrast, under even large back-end costs, optimal contracts are complete. Applied to the design of procurement contracts, our results rationalize: (i) the discreteness of contracts, (ii) the presence of similarly vague contracts in low-stakes and high-stakes settings, and (iii) the discontinuous adjustment of contracts to changes in the economic environment.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34379#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.697447","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.697473","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ae744aa1280c","title":"PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?","content":"arXiv:2510.17681v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17681","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:11:07.943742","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscv","preprints","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The approach comes with an efficient computational procedure based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization, facilitating scalability to large datasets.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_58781d1669ce","title":"Learn2Decompose: Learning Problem Decomposition for Efficient Sequential Multi","content":"arXiv:2408.06843v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present a Reactive Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approach for efficient sequential multi-object manipulation in dynamic environments. Conventional TAMP solvers experience an exponential increase in planning time as the planning horizon and number of objects grow, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose learning problem decomposition from demonstrations to accelerate TAMP solvers. Our approach consists of three key components: goal decomposition learning, temporal distance learning, and object reduction. Goal decomposition identifies the necessary sequences of states that the system must pass through before reaching the final goal, treating them as subgoal sequences. Temporal distance learning predicts the temporal distance between two states, enabling the system to identify the closest subgoal from a disturbed state. Object reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during replanning, further improving efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving replanning efficiency for sequential multi-object manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06843","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:11:08.033318","language":"en","tags":["research","csro","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

To comprehend the variables that affect decision-making regarding diabetes prediction that can be accounted for by model-agnostic techniques. In this project, we investigate how to generate local and global explanations for a machine-learning model built on a logistic regression architecture. We trained on 253,680 survey responses from diabetes patients using the explainable AI techniques LIME and SHAP. LIME and SHAP were then used to explain the predictions produced by the logistic regression and Random forest-based model on the validation and test sets. With a discussion of future work, the comparative analysis and discussion of various experimental findings between LIME and SHAP are provided, along with their strengths and weaknesses in terms of interpretation. With a high accuracy of 86% on the test set, we used LR architecture with a spatial attention mechanism, demonstrating the possibility of merging machine learning and explainable AI to improve diabetes prediction, diagnosis, and treatment. We also focus on various applications, difficulties, and probable future directions of machine learning models for LIME and SHAP interpreters.","source":"semantic_scholar","source_type":"api","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7dd561e01708885d99ce23de9ca492b76a8fd66b","published_date":"2025-10-21T10:57:42.948074","collected_date":"2025-10-21T12:57:42.948093","language":"en","tags":["academic","research","journalarticle","review"],"metadata":{"paper_id":"7dd561e01708885d99ce23de9ca492b76a8fd66b","venue":"IEEE Access","authors":["Shamim Ahmed","M.

{"id":"semantic_scholar_050628f39b51","title":"The Inequitable Access to Vaccines and Medicines in Africa: A Critical Review of the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation (APTF)","content":"In 2023, as the COVID-19 pandemic receded, the African Development Bank Group launched the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation to address the inequities in vaccine production and distribution during the pandemic that disproportionately affected the African continent. The foundation aims to enhance Africa’s local pharmaceutical capacity and access to the technologies necessary for discovering and manufacturing medicines. This commentary identifies critical concerns that could undermine the foundation’s objectives and legitimacy, including the potential misuse of public resources due to overlap with a similar agency; the endorsement of a “black box” system that impedes genuine international technology transfer of pharmaceutical know-how and resources; a continent-wide approach that fails to account for Africa’s diversity; and the absence of a clear public accountability structure in the foundation’s governance framework. The article also offers preliminary recommendations to address these challenges.","source":"semantic_scholar","source_type":"api","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e6d03611b97e7ae8938901a071884c70586dcef6","published_date":"2025-10-21T11:03:15.735461","collected_date":"2025-10-21T13:03:15.735479","language":"en","tags":["academic","research","journalarticle","review","healthcare_tech"],"metadata":{"paper_id":"e6d03611b97e7ae8938901a071884c70586dcef6","venue":"Global Perspectives","authors":["Morris K.

{"id":"arxiv_518abe736cb7","title":"Triangle Multiplication Is All You Need For Biomolecular Structure Representations","content":"AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18870v1","published_date":"2025-10-21T17:59:02","collected_date":"2025-10-22T06:07:35.998622","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","q-bioqm"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.18870v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18870v1.pdf","authors":["Jeffrey Ouyang-Zhang","Pranav Murugan","Daniel J.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9003db18468a","title":"RiskTagger: An LLM","content":"arXiv:2510.17848v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While the rapid growth of Web3 has driven the development of decentralized finance, user anonymity and cross-chain asset flows make on-chain laundering behaviors more covert and complex. In this context, constructing high-quality anti-money laundering(AML) datasets has become essential for risk-control systems and on-chain forensic analysis, yet current practices still rely heavily on manual efforts with limited efficiency and coverage. In this paper, we introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic annotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to replace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges: extracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain transaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger implements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor, a multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer, forming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack (with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100% accuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90% coverage in explanation generation. Overall, RiskTagger automates laundering behavior annotation while improving transparency and scalability in AML research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17848","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.073355","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing capabilities across various

We first audit five widely used gender classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace, it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender classification research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17873","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.082239","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_909b8bbc8c4f","title":"Assignment","content":"arXiv:2510.17888v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study a joint routing-assignment optimization problem in which a set of items must be paired one-to-one with a set of placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle that visits every node exactly once. Both the assignment and routing decisions are optimized jointly to minimize the total travel cost. In this work, we propose a method to solve this problem using an exact MIP formulation with Gurobi, including cutting-plane subtour elimination. With analysis of the computational complexity and through extensive experiments, we analyze the computational limitations of this approach as the problem size grows and reveal the challenges associated with the need for more efficient algorithms for larger instances. The dataset, formulations, and experimental results provided here can serve as benchmarks for future studies in this research area.

We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17916","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.095490","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","q-bionc","csai","cslg","csne","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

As with any new technology, trust has taken on an important role in this discussion. In this chapter, we examine the multifaceted concept of trust in foundation models, particularly within a geographic context. As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for critical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured concept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the training data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and interpersonal trust in the model developers. Each type of trust brings with it unique implications for geographic applications. Topics such as cultural context, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the spatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter continues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of biases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical responsibilities in model development. Finally, the novel perspective of geographic information scientists is emphasized with a call for further transparency, bias mitigation, and regionally-informed policies. Simply put, this chapter aims to provide a conceptual starting point for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand trust in (generative) GeoAI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17942","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.103379","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscy","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

Our framework is an elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models (TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the original setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined by a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $\\Omega$. We introduce $j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by Kripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving morphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule system whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal Intuitionistic logic of the causal topos. We define $j$-stability for conditional independences and interventional claims as local truth in the internal logic of the causal topos. We give three inference rules that mirror Pearl's insertion/deletion and action/observation exchange, and we prove soundness in the Kripke-Joyal semantics. A companion paper in preparation will describe how to estimate the required entities from data and instantiate $j$-do with standard discovery procedures (e.g., score-based and constraint-based methods), and will include experimental results on how to (i) form data-driven $j$-covers (via regime/section constructions), (ii) compute chartwise conditional independences after graph surgeries,

To address this, we introduce Chimera, a personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions. To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464 unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional accuracy and 21% in visual quality.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18083","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.125933","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

However, SAR scenarios demand stringent security and low-latency communication, as delays or breaches can compromise mission success. While UAVs serve as mobile relays, they introduce challenges in energy consumption and resource management, necessitating intelligent allocation strategies. Existing UAV-assisted O-RAN approaches often overlook the joint optimization of security, latency, and energy efficiency in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic resource allocation in UAV relays, explicitly addressing these trade-offs. Our approach formulates an optimization problem that integrates security-aware resource allocation, latency minimization, and energy efficiency, which is solved using RL. Unlike heuristic or static methods, our framework adapts in real-time to network dynamics, ensuring robust communication. Simulations demonstrate superior performance compared to heuristic baselines, achieving enhanced security and energy efficiency while maintaining ultra-low latency in SAR scenarios.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18084","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.126367","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csai","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior. In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets (especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features. Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18256","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.159673","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9559b35a34d2","title":"When Old Meets New: Evaluating the Impact of Regression Tests on SWE Issue Resolution","content":"arXiv:2510.18270v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose: debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2) validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch validation. A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \\$0.02 and \\$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance, using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18270","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.163834","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

However, Braille information processing faces challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks, we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_d72121480cac","title":"Enhancing Few","content":"arXiv:2510.18326v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness. Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points. Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net compared to existing approaches.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18326","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.177435","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_03d149a70bb4","title":"Coverage","content":"arXiv:2510.18347v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile, recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D reconstructions than conventional methods.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_0e8c001d9401","title":"PGTT: Phase","content":"arXiv:2510.18348v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate \"blind\", which struggle to anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances (median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2 using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18348","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.182907","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csai","cslg","csro","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

However, its performance is limited for open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic, human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider

tasks.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18434","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.201754","language":"en","tags":["cscl","research","preprints","computer-science","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

It achieves faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_c4f2212ca50b","title":"MTraining: Distributed Dynamic Sparse Attention for Efficient Ultra","content":"arXiv:2510.18830v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput while preserving model accuracy.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_36e8c93ac36d","title":"LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory","content":"arXiv:2510.18866v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

Motor unit (MU) decomposition from surface electromyography (sEMG) is a key technique for extracting neural drive information, but traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods fail to incorporate biophysical constraints, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation (BMISS) framework, which integrates anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. By leveraging MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling, our approach enables direct inversion of a biophysically accurate forward model to estimate both neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner. Empirical validation in a controlled simulated setting demonstrates that BMISS achieves higher fidelity motor unit estimation while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional methods.

However, many real-world applications fundamentally rely on sensitive data, which can be leaked through e-values. To ensure their safe release, we propose a general framework to transform non-private e-values into differentially private ones. Towards this end, we develop a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism that ensures our e-values remain statistically valid. We show that our differentially private e-values attain strong statistical power, and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private counterparts. Experiments across online risk monitoring, private healthcare, and conformal e-prediction demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and illustrate its broad applicability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18654","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.312503","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","statme","cslg","cscr","statml","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The first method, RPCholesky preconditioning, accurately solves the full-data KRR problem in $O(N^2)$ arithmetic operations, assuming sufficiently rapid polynomial decay of the kernel matrix eigenvalues. The second method, KRILL preconditioning, offers an accurate solution to a restricted version of the KRR problem involving $k \\ll N$ selected data centers at a cost of $O((N + k^2) k \\log k)$ operations.

These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.323510","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","csai","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

However, efficiently compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^3$, a novel point cloud compression framework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both geometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel occupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby implicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud. The encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the original point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through techniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^3$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: For static point clouds, NeRC$^3$ outperforms octree-based G-PCC standard and existing INR-based methods. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^3$ achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods. It also demonstrates competitive performance in joint geometry and attribute compression.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10433","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.339750","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","cslg","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

We show that the mean + variance calibration of these rewards induces a weighted contrastive loss in which the contrastive samples are synthetic data drawn from the previous policy. While GRPO was originally paired with clipping to keep updates near the old policy, we analyze variants that differ in reward normalization (mean-only vs mean + variance) and in how they regularize updates using KL divergence: either penalizing divergence from the previous model (mirror), penalizing divergence from a fixed reference model $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, or combining both forms of regularization. For each, the optimal policy $\\pi_n$ admits an explicit form in terms of the binary reward and the first and second order statistics of the reward under $\\pi_{n-1}$, as well as the policies $\\pi_{n-1}$ and $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Iterating results in a sequence $\\{\\pi_n\\}$ whose probability of success (PoS) obeys a simple recurrence that converges to a fixed point determined by the reference PoS and the regularization strength. We further show that this fixed point exceeds the reference, demonstrating that GRPO amplifies the policy's probability of success.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06639","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.353714","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","statml","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1974fd8a7cb0","title":"Changing Base Without Losing Pace: A GPU","content":"arXiv:2503.12211v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation poses a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an alternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which offers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In particular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\\ll n^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\\gg n^2$). We call this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local learnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation matrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented simultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to optimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex problem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix and polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than random SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study of STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and can improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while lowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves wall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with its theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12211","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.355409","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csai","cslg","csds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The main challenge of the conventional $h$-adaptive finite element method is interpolating the finite element solution from the previous step in the updated mesh. The interpolation dependent on the new mesh must be recomputed at each adaptive iteration, resulting in high computational costs. The new approach addresses this challenge by introducing a neural network to construct a mesh-free surrogate of the previous step finite element solution. Since the neural network is mesh-free, it only requires training once per time step, with its parameters initialized using the minimizer of the previous time step. This approach effectively overcomes the interpolation challenges associated with non-nested meshes in computation, making node insertion and movement more convenient and efficient. The new algorithm also emphasizes SIZE and GENERATE, allowing each refinement to roughly double the number of mesh nodes of the previous iteration and then redistribute them to form a new mesh that effectively captures the singularities. It significantly reduces the time required for repeated refinement of the conventional methods and achieves the desired accuracy in no more than seven space-adaptive iterations per time step. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in capturing dynamic changes of singularities. The code is made publicly available on GitHub.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12717","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.356240","language":"en","tags":["csna","research","preprints","computer-science","mathna","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12458","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.430998","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","eesssy","cssy","cset","csro","csar","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

We hypothesize that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung of

We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very \"act\" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external \"judgment\" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\\\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.439681","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

We examine the benefit of having a protected eavesdropper-free zone around the legitimate receiver, and we determine the worst-case secrecy performance against a potential eavesdropper located anywhere outside the protected zone. A max-min optimization problem is formulated for the beamfocusing design with and without artificial noise transmission. Despite the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop a synchronous gradient descent-ascent framework that approximates the global maximin solution. A low-complexity solution is also derived that delivers excellent performance over a wide range of operating conditions. We further extend this study to a scenario where it is not possible to physically enforce a protected zone. To this end, we consider secure communications through the creation of a virtual protected zone using a full-duplex legitimate receiver. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting either the physical or virtual receiver-centered protected zone with appropriately designed beamfocusing is an effective strategy for achieving secure near-field communications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19523","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.502238","language":"en","tags":["mathit","research","preprints","computer-science","csit","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Cen Liu, Xiangyun Zhou, Nan Yang, Salman Durrani, A.

In particular, we consider a classical damped wave equation, i.e., with constant coefficients, and a wave equation with a time-dependent coefficient for the damping term. For this time-dependent coefficient we analyze two cases: the scale-invariant case and the scattering producing case. We prove blow-up results and derive upper bound estimates for the lifespan of local solutions. Our approach is based on an iteration argument for a couple of functionals related to the components of a local

The main obstruction is that \\(Wf\\) is covariant (not invariant) under time-frequency shifts, so the effects of constructive interference must be taken into account. We close this compactness gap via concentration compactness for Heisenberg-type dislocations, together with a new asymptotic formula that quantifies the limiting contribution to concentration over $\\Omega$ from asymptotically separated wave packets. When $p=\\infty$ we also identify the sharp constant $2^d$ and show that it is attained. We also discuss some related extensions: For $\\tau$-Wigner distributions with $\\tau \\in (0,1)$ we isolate a chain phenomenon that obstructs the same strategy beyond the Wigner case ($\\tau=1/2$), while for the Born--Jordan distribution in $d=1$ we obtain existence of concentration optimizers for all $1\\le p<\\infty$ (the $p=\\infty$ supremum equals $\\pi$ but is not attained).","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18683","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:56:32.694778","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathfa","mathca","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Federico Stra, Erling A.

We remark that the spaces considered in this paper are not necessarily warped product manifolds themselves. In particular, the results of this paper are applicable to submanifolds (of warped product manifolds) with faces that are neither orthogonal nor parallel to the radial direction of the warped product metric. Generally speaking, the dihedral rigidity results require the leaf of the underlying warped space to have positive Ricci curvature and the warping function to be strictly log-concave. Nevertheless, we prove a dihedral rigidity theorem for a large class of hyperbolic polyhedra, where the leaf of the underlying warped product space is flat and the warping function is not strictly

These are modeled by a micromagnetic energy functional on the unit sphere that leads to the emergence of the so-called curvature induced Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. For this functional we establish the existence of two distinct types of saddle points with zero mapping degree. We use a parabolic flow approach inspired by the harmonic map heat flow where for certain highly symmetric initial conditions we can rule out finite and infinite time blowup. Hence, we obtain solutions of the underlying Euler--Lagrange equation in the long time limit. This is in contrast to harmonic maps between two-spheres, where every map is a local minimizer of the energy functional.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05159","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:56:32.768771","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathap","mathmp","math-ph","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math

{"id":"ai_engadget_ebf381e4f76c","title":"Samsung is working on XR smart glasses with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster","content":"As part of its Galaxy XR headset presentation, Samsung also briefly teased another wearable product. It's working in collaboration with two eyewear companies, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, on AI-powered smart glasses to go up against Meta's Ray-Ban models, Samsung's head of customer experience Jay Kim announced at the end of the livestream. \"We're also really excited about the AI glasses that we're currently building together with Google,\" Kim said. \"We're working with two of the most forward-thinking brands in eyewear, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, to introduce new devices that fit into your lifestyle.\" Samsung will focus on two different markets with those brands, though both will include \"cutting-edge\" AI features co-developed with Google. With Gentle Monster, it's developing \"fashion-forward\" glasses that will likely be aimed at the higher end of the market. The Warby Parker collaboration, meanwhile, will yield eyewear designed for general consumers, probably at a lower price point. Samsung only said that the AI glasses will bring \"style, comfort and practicality\" to everyday life via Android's XR ecosystem. As we saw in May with Google's prototype XR smart glasses, it will likely employ a Gemini-powered display that will show notifications and small snippets of info from your apps, like the music you're listening to or turn-by-turn GPS directions. It should also have a built-in camera, of course, along with speakers and a microphone. Design and appearance will also be key, but Samsung has yet to show any images of the upcoming smart glasses and didn't reveal a release date. However, it will have a tough climb against Meta's lineup given the Ray-Ban branding and that company's head start on the technology. Last week, Meta introduced its Ray-Ban Display model that includes a screen for a true extended reality experience.

{"id":"ai_engadget_466480cab104","title":"Microsoft increases the price of Xbox dev kits by $500","content":"Players aren't the only ones facing higher price tags from Xbox. According to a report by The Verge, Microsoft has upped the cost of the Xbox Development Kit from $1,500 to $2,000. That's a 33 percent jump in cost for these custom hardware kits, which are essential for devs to make and test games for release on the console. \"The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,\" Microsoft said in an email sent to Xbox devs and seen by The Verge. \"We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.\" Although the macroeconomics in question are almost certainly the tariffs enacted by the US, it appears this is a blanket increase that will impact developers in other countries as well. The new kit costs appear to be effective immediately. The change caps off a series of price increases for the Xbox ecosystem. Game Pass prices recently rose, with the Ultimate tier now costing $30 a month compared to the previous $20. And Microsoft has upped the cost of the Xbox twice this year, once in May and again in September. Between these additional expenses and the little matter of cutting thousands of gaming jobs earlier this year, a lot of us are giving up on Xbox before Microsoft can disappoint us yet again.This

Well, here's exactly the kind of work we hoped would happen. rBridge: Use 1B models to predict whether your 32B model will be good at reasoning. Actually works. The problem: Small models can't do reasoning (emergence happens at 7B+), so how do you know if your training recipe works without spending $200k? Our solution: Align evaluation with both pre-training objective AND target task Use frontier model reasoning traces as gold labels Weight tokens by task importance automatically Results: 100x compute reduction vs baselines Accurately predict which datasets are worth training on R¬≤ = 0.826 predicting 32B performance from 1B proxy Works zero-shot on new datasets Tested on: GSM8K, MATH500, ARC-C, MMLU Pro, CQA, HumanEval Paper: https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013 This is what open research looks like - building on each other's work to make LLM development accessible to everyone, not just companies with infinite compute.
