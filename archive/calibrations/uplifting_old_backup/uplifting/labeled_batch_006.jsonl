Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention, and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput while preserving model accuracy.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_36e8c93ac36d","title":"LightMem: Lightweight and Efficient Memory","content":"arXiv:2510.18866v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First, cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information through lightweight compression and groups information according to their topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally, long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

Motor unit (MU) decomposition from surface electromyography (sEMG) is a key technique for extracting neural drive information, but traditional blind source separation (BSS) methods fail to incorporate biophysical constraints, limiting their accuracy and interpretability. In this work, we introduce a novel Biophysical-Model-Informed Source Separation (BMISS) framework, which integrates anatomically accurate forward EMG models into the decomposition process. By leveraging MRI-based anatomical reconstructions and generative modeling, our approach enables direct inversion of a biophysically accurate forward model to estimate both neural drive and motor neuron properties in an unsupervised manner. Empirical validation in a controlled simulated setting demonstrates that BMISS achieves higher fidelity motor unit estimation while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional methods.

However, many real-world applications fundamentally rely on sensitive data, which can be leaked through e-values. To ensure their safe release, we propose a general framework to transform non-private e-values into differentially private ones. Towards this end, we develop a novel biased multiplicative noise mechanism that ensures our e-values remain statistically valid. We show that our differentially private e-values attain strong statistical power, and are asymptotically as powerful as their non-private counterparts. Experiments across online risk monitoring, private healthcare, and conformal e-prediction demonstrate our approach's effectiveness and illustrate its broad applicability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18654","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.312503","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","statme","cslg","cscr","statml","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The first method, RPCholesky preconditioning, accurately solves the full-data KRR problem in $O(N^2)$ arithmetic operations, assuming sufficiently rapid polynomial decay of the kernel matrix eigenvalues. The second method, KRILL preconditioning, offers an accurate solution to a restricted version of the KRR problem involving $k \\ll N$ selected data centers at a cost of $O((N + k^2) k \\log k)$ operations.

These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.323510","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","csai","cscl","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

However, efficiently compressing unstructured, high-precision point cloud data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose NeRC$^3$, a novel point cloud compression framework that leverages implicit neural representations (INRs) to encode both geometry and attributes of dense point clouds. Our approach employs two coordinate-based neural networks: one maps spatial coordinates to voxel occupancy, while the other maps occupied voxels to their attributes, thereby implicitly representing the geometry and attributes of a voxelized point cloud. The encoder quantizes and compresses network parameters alongside auxiliary information required for reconstruction, while the decoder reconstructs the original point cloud by inputting voxel coordinates into the neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our method to dynamic point cloud compression through techniques that reduce temporal redundancy, including a 4D spatio-temporal representation termed 4D-NeRC$^3$. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach: For static point clouds, NeRC$^3$ outperforms octree-based G-PCC standard and existing INR-based methods. For dynamic point clouds, 4D-NeRC$^3$ achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the latest G-PCC and V-PCC standards, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods. It also demonstrates competitive performance in joint geometry and attribute compression.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10433","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.339750","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","cslg","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

We show that the mean + variance calibration of these rewards induces a weighted contrastive loss in which the contrastive samples are synthetic data drawn from the previous policy. While GRPO was originally paired with clipping to keep updates near the old policy, we analyze variants that differ in reward normalization (mean-only vs mean + variance) and in how they regularize updates using KL divergence: either penalizing divergence from the previous model (mirror), penalizing divergence from a fixed reference model $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, or combining both forms of regularization. For each, the optimal policy $\\pi_n$ admits an explicit form in terms of the binary reward and the first and second order statistics of the reward under $\\pi_{n-1}$, as well as the policies $\\pi_{n-1}$ and $\\pi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. Iterating results in a sequence $\\{\\pi_n\\}$ whose probability of success (PoS) obeys a simple recurrence that converges to a fixed point determined by the reference PoS and the regularization strength. We further show that this fixed point exceeds the reference, demonstrating that GRPO amplifies the policy's probability of success.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06639","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.353714","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslg","statml","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_1974fd8a7cb0","title":"Changing Base Without Losing Pace: A GPU","content":"arXiv:2503.12211v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation poses a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an alternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which offers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In particular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\\ll n^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\\gg n^2$). We call this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local learnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation matrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented simultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to optimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex problem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix and polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than random SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study of STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and can improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while lowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves wall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with its theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12211","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.355409","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csai","cslg","csds","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_929a17da3ee7","title":"Neural network","content":"arXiv:2503.12717v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel $hr$-adaptive finite element method, enhanced by neural networks, for parabolic equations. The main challenge of the conventional $h$-adaptive finite element method is interpolating the finite element solution from the previous step in the updated mesh. The interpolation dependent on the new mesh must be recomputed at each adaptive iteration, resulting in high computational costs. The new approach addresses this challenge by introducing a neural network to construct a mesh-free surrogate of the previous step finite element solution. Since the neural network is mesh-free, it only requires training once per time step, with its parameters initialized using the minimizer of the previous time step. This approach effectively overcomes the interpolation challenges associated with non-nested meshes in computation, making node insertion and movement more convenient and efficient. The new algorithm also emphasizes SIZE and GENERATE, allowing each refinement to roughly double the number of mesh nodes of the previous iteration and then redistribute them to form a new mesh that effectively captures the singularities. It significantly reduces the time required for repeated refinement of the conventional methods and achieves the desired accuracy in no more than seven space-adaptive iterations per time step. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in capturing dynamic changes of singularities. The code is made publicly available on GitHub.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12717","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.356240","language":"en","tags":["csna","research","preprints","computer-science","mathna","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs
