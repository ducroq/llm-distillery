{"id":"arxiv_518abe736cb7","title":"Triangle Multiplication Is All You Need For Biomolecular Structure Representations","content":"AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.","source":"arxiv","source_type":"api","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18870v1","published_date":"2025-10-21T17:59:02","collected_date":"2025-10-22T06:07:35.998622","language":"en","tags":["preprint","academic","q-bioqm"],"metadata":{"arxiv_id":"2510.18870v1","pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18870v1.pdf","authors":["Jeffrey Ouyang-Zhang","Pranav Murugan","Daniel J.
