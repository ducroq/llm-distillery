A point of the Hilbert scheme corresponds to an ideal in the ring of global sections on $(C,O).$ We study the geometry of subsets of these Hilbert schemes defined by constraints on the minimal number of generators of the defining ideal, and describe some of their geometric properties.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06761","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:56:32.708638","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathag","mathac","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math

We remark that the spaces considered in this paper are not necessarily warped product manifolds themselves. In particular, the results of this paper are applicable to submanifolds (of warped product manifolds) with faces that are neither orthogonal nor parallel to the radial direction of the warped product metric. Generally speaking, the dihedral rigidity results require the leaf of the underlying warped space to have positive Ricci curvature and the warping function to be strictly log-concave. Nevertheless, we prove a dihedral rigidity theorem for a large class of hyperbolic polyhedra, where the leaf of the underlying warped product space is flat and the warping function is not strictly

These are modeled by a micromagnetic energy functional on the unit sphere that leads to the emergence of the so-called curvature induced Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. For this functional we establish the existence of two distinct types of saddle points with zero mapping degree. We use a parabolic flow approach inspired by the harmonic map heat flow where for certain highly symmetric initial conditions we can rule out finite and infinite time blowup. Hence, we obtain solutions of the underlying Euler--Lagrange equation in the long time limit. This is in contrast to harmonic maps between two-spheres, where every map is a local minimizer of the energy functional.","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05159","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:56:32.768771","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathap","mathmp","math-ph","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math

{"id":"ai_engadget_ebf381e4f76c","title":"Samsung is working on XR smart glasses with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster","content":"As part of its Galaxy XR headset presentation, Samsung also briefly teased another wearable product. It's working in collaboration with two eyewear companies, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, on AI-powered smart glasses to go up against Meta's Ray-Ban models, Samsung's head of customer experience Jay Kim announced at the end of the livestream. \"We're also really excited about the AI glasses that we're currently building together with Google,\" Kim said. \"We're working with two of the most forward-thinking brands in eyewear, Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, to introduce new devices that fit into your lifestyle.\" Samsung will focus on two different markets with those brands, though both will include \"cutting-edge\" AI features co-developed with Google. With Gentle Monster, it's developing \"fashion-forward\" glasses that will likely be aimed at the higher end of the market. The Warby Parker collaboration, meanwhile, will yield eyewear designed for general consumers, probably at a lower price point. Samsung only said that the AI glasses will bring \"style, comfort and practicality\" to everyday life via Android's XR ecosystem. As we saw in May with Google's prototype XR smart glasses, it will likely employ a Gemini-powered display that will show notifications and small snippets of info from your apps, like the music you're listening to or turn-by-turn GPS directions. It should also have a built-in camera, of course, along with speakers and a microphone. Design and appearance will also be key, but Samsung has yet to show any images of the upcoming smart glasses and didn't reveal a release date. However, it will have a tough climb against Meta's lineup given the Ray-Ban branding and that company's head start on the technology. Last week, Meta introduced its Ray-Ban Display model that includes a screen for a true extended reality experience.

{"id":"ai_engadget_466480cab104","title":"Microsoft increases the price of Xbox dev kits by $500","content":"Players aren't the only ones facing higher price tags from Xbox. According to a report by The Verge, Microsoft has upped the cost of the Xbox Development Kit from $1,500 to $2,000. That's a 33 percent jump in cost for these custom hardware kits, which are essential for devs to make and test games for release on the console. \"The adjustment reflects macroeconomic developments,\" Microsoft said in an email sent to Xbox devs and seen by The Verge. \"We remain committed to providing high-quality tools and support for your development efforts.\" Although the macroeconomics in question are almost certainly the tariffs enacted by the US, it appears this is a blanket increase that will impact developers in other countries as well. The new kit costs appear to be effective immediately. The change caps off a series of price increases for the Xbox ecosystem. Game Pass prices recently rose, with the Ultimate tier now costing $30 a month compared to the previous $20. And Microsoft has upped the cost of the Xbox twice this year, once in May and again in September. Between these additional expenses and the little matter of cutting thousands of gaming jobs earlier this year, a lot of us are giving up on Xbox before Microsoft can disappoint us yet again.This
