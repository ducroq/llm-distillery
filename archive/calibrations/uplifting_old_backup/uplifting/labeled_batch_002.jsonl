We evaluate state regulation of hospital mergers under Certificates of Public Advantage (COPAs). Using hospital data from 1996-2022, we compare COPA-regulated mergers to unregulated mergers with similar anticompetitive potential. In highly concentrated markets, COPA mergers result in 11.1 p.p. lower price growth but 0.5 p.p. greater increases in 30-day mortality rates. We find a negative correlation between price and mortality effects for COPA mergers, consistent with theoretical predictions that binding price caps exacerbate quality deterioration. Our findings suggest that COPA contracts are poor substitutes for traditional antitrust enforcement.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34373#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.696241","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.696270","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National

{"id":"economics_nber_working_papers_568fe5717e92","title":"Children Are Bridges to Heaven: The Effects of Fertility on Later-Life Mortality -","content":"Several competing theories in a number of disciplines point to a possible influence of fertility history on health and mortality. However, the direction of effects is theoretically a-priori unknown and the empirical evidence is also inconclusive. This paper examines the effects of fertility during midlife on later-life longevity using Social Security Administration death records linked with the full-count 1940 census. We tackle endogeneity and selection concerns in the longevity-fertility association by implementing an instrumental variable based on the sex composition of first two children. Our findings indicate that having an extra child is linked to a decrease in women’s longevity by approximately 5 months. Men, on the other hand, experience smaller and insignificant reductions in longevity of about 3.3 months. This divergence in effects suggests that biological factors may play a small role in the relationship between fertility and later-life longevity.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34378#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.697259","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.697290","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National Bureau of Economic Research Working Papers","source_category":"economics","word_count":141,"author":null,"raw_content_length":971,"priority":8,"update_frequency":24,"reading_time_minutes":0.705,"robust_parsing_used":true,"entities":{"organizations":["Later-Life Mortality - Several","Social Security Administration"],"persons":[],"locations":[],"monetary":[]},"char_count":971,"language_detected":"en","key_concepts":{"key_phrases":["Children","Bridges","Heaven","The Effects","Fertility","Later-Life Mortality","Several competing theories","a number","disciplines","a possible influence"],"filter_categories":{},"extraction_method":"spacy","confidence":"high","concept_scores":{"Children":2.0,"Bridges":2.0,"Heaven":2.0,"The Effects":2.0,"Fertility":2.0,"Later-Life Mortality":2.0,"Several competing theories":1.0,"a number":1.0,"disciplines":1.0,"a possible influence":1.0}},"age_hours":2.0809974483333336,"is_recent":true,"quality_score":1.0,"hashes":{"content_md5":"535eb9d206c934af72d1183a04db191e","title_md5":"f0d28dcffedf9830d3ee4e88671d7322","url_normalized":"89f67e00b532616be514d9717d96cc22","minhash_signature":["9837667","16221366","14366","13560711","18729664","4631126","19721531","2181150","693538","4729967","3139314","2763186","2343024","1166689","16595777","7389182","14171223","10786263","13951128","955784","1196901","88593","25690881","11641973","11424750","14410239","7507083","9327886","21074790","1456173","522500","6606854","18205745","9969046","1053967","16352021","10844376","5605276","7167732","30141695","4708391","3329444","33852562","1785966","39996494","2720336","1691750","20266055","1132398","16941830","24214257","843096","17357374","4194521","9983662","5146736","226173","6045037","4656097","1151625","2318646","19074674","1936","4050641","7601","13418347","21625977","1563117","7564697","4625726","7249981","1755940","15056664","4528274","7951082","2595826","269839","6134367","9506978","13381973","14672648","6491954","3972917","10833656","11728217","2319043","4602115","12075368","1442738","1755802","7521029","1254119","19499623","436779","12786202","11266958","1608076","479007","24302950","713149","1534879","13263583","4327830","7495224","1806145","16888711","2193094","12541577","12007630","6841584","1243296","120729","5520226","76161","756656","13776844","873230","1307835","6431271","12207048","1131087","7895850","25381733","363706","3829832","12563646","4653766","14026051"],"title_minhash":["24942206","66260777","4229889","52918094","46183253","34946918","85381145","93931466","148393289","40064675","43296864","77470861","10736429","58535784","24720415","7389182","42803213","48406674","28843053","38876791","6058284","5184937","54507159","11641973","42290639","34449760","84257291","139139768","47381118","1456173","3290860","16000752","81484603","34963712","7626088","27257070","28724667","380697209","158376087","72103261","66062348","59276361","115753605","16067791","50391278","22056152","168199762","32330908","239169219","35423699","135664802","8355167","17357374","7574389","25136413","13331872","132354965","32296567","123693004","8076200","67726972","27212162","1936","107800758","176369908","70272572","21803903","3973728","39322970","252598443","19680712","80825518","173035524","118429636","7951082","63642210","10923713","6134367","23400542","13381973","43882922","14255238","57336166","134183993","15871323","119197467","93403703","19829573","47091666","61481582","74938439","305974082","52246873","20217852","145369095","108646180","34934479","43573138","50107332","35832301","131824704","80026776","12477765","84762869","8090509","156615398","185958462","20554633","12007630","44001","38267602","55388461","95873764","107443661","40822438","28227271","46471986","1307835","52513354","58701966","19426395","76350134","188617325","363706","31202914","17430089","61576740","45227134"],"combined_hash":"e413bb54d47a6eb379ccb8d4656331fa"},"sentiment_score":6.3660000000000005,"sentiment_category":"positive","sentiment_confidence":"medium","sentiment_method":"vader","sentiment_raw_score":0.2732,"is_positive":true,"is_negative":false,"is_neutral":false,"raw_emotions":{"neutral":0.806,"joy":0.0113,"surprise":0.045,"sadness":0.0388,"fear":0.061,"anger":0.0157,"disgust":0.0222},"emotion_method":"local"},"uplifting_analysis":{"content_type":"community_building","agency":2,"progress":3,"collective_benefit":4,"connection":1,"innovation":3,"justice":1,"resilience":2,"wonder":1,"reasoning":"This article presents research on the impact of fertility on longevity.

Designing an evidence structure entails both (i) front-end costs borne ex ante, such as those of drafting contracts, and (ii) back-end costs borne ex post, such as those of generating evidence. We find that, under even small front-end costs, optimal contracts are coarse, specifying finitely many contingencies out of a continuum of possibilities. In contrast, under even large back-end costs, optimal contracts are complete. Applied to the design of procurement contracts, our results rationalize: (i) the discreteness of contracts, (ii) the presence of similarly vague contracts in low-stakes and high-stakes settings, and (iii) the discontinuous adjustment of contracts to changes in the economic environment.","source":"economics_nber_working_papers","source_type":"rss","url":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w34379#fromrss","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:10:49.697447","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:10:49.697473","language":"en","tags":["economics","working-papers","research"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"National

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_ae744aa1280c","title":"PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?","content":"arXiv:2510.17681v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17681","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:11:07.943742","language":"en","tags":["computer-science","cscv","preprints","csai","research","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The approach comes with an efficient computational procedure based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization, facilitating scalability to large datasets.

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_58781d1669ce","title":"Learn2Decompose: Learning Problem Decomposition for Efficient Sequential Multi","content":"arXiv:2408.06843v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present a Reactive Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approach for efficient sequential multi-object manipulation in dynamic environments. Conventional TAMP solvers experience an exponential increase in planning time as the planning horizon and number of objects grow, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose learning problem decomposition from demonstrations to accelerate TAMP solvers. Our approach consists of three key components: goal decomposition learning, temporal distance learning, and object reduction. Goal decomposition identifies the necessary sequences of states that the system must pass through before reaching the final goal, treating them as subgoal sequences. Temporal distance learning predicts the temporal distance between two states, enabling the system to identify the closest subgoal from a disturbed state. Object reduction minimizes the set of active objects considered during replanning, further improving efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving replanning efficiency for sequential multi-object manipulation tasks in dynamic environments.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06843","published_date":"2025-10-21T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-21T06:11:08.033318","language":"en","tags":["research","csro","computer-science","preprints","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

To comprehend the variables that affect decision-making regarding diabetes prediction that can be accounted for by model-agnostic techniques. In this project, we investigate how to generate local and global explanations for a machine-learning model built on a logistic regression architecture. We trained on 253,680 survey responses from diabetes patients using the explainable AI techniques LIME and SHAP. LIME and SHAP were then used to explain the predictions produced by the logistic regression and Random forest-based model on the validation and test sets. With a discussion of future work, the comparative analysis and discussion of various experimental findings between LIME and SHAP are provided, along with their strengths and weaknesses in terms of interpretation. With a high accuracy of 86% on the test set, we used LR architecture with a spatial attention mechanism, demonstrating the possibility of merging machine learning and explainable AI to improve diabetes prediction, diagnosis, and treatment. We also focus on various applications, difficulties, and probable future directions of machine learning models for LIME and SHAP interpreters.","source":"semantic_scholar","source_type":"api","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7dd561e01708885d99ce23de9ca492b76a8fd66b","published_date":"2025-10-21T10:57:42.948074","collected_date":"2025-10-21T12:57:42.948093","language":"en","tags":["academic","research","journalarticle","review"],"metadata":{"paper_id":"7dd561e01708885d99ce23de9ca492b76a8fd66b","venue":"IEEE Access","authors":["Shamim Ahmed","M.

{"id":"semantic_scholar_050628f39b51","title":"The Inequitable Access to Vaccines and Medicines in Africa: A Critical Review of the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation (APTF)","content":"In 2023, as the COVID-19 pandemic receded, the African Development Bank Group launched the African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation to address the inequities in vaccine production and distribution during the pandemic that disproportionately affected the African continent. The foundation aims to enhance Africa’s local pharmaceutical capacity and access to the technologies necessary for discovering and manufacturing medicines. This commentary identifies critical concerns that could undermine the foundation’s objectives and legitimacy, including the potential misuse of public resources due to overlap with a similar agency; the endorsement of a “black box” system that impedes genuine international technology transfer of pharmaceutical know-how and resources; a continent-wide approach that fails to account for Africa’s diversity; and the absence of a clear public accountability structure in the foundation’s governance framework. The article also offers preliminary recommendations to address these challenges.","source":"semantic_scholar","source_type":"api","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e6d03611b97e7ae8938901a071884c70586dcef6","published_date":"2025-10-21T11:03:15.735461","collected_date":"2025-10-21T13:03:15.735479","language":"en","tags":["academic","research","journalarticle","review","healthcare_tech"],"metadata":{"paper_id":"e6d03611b97e7ae8938901a071884c70586dcef6","venue":"Global Perspectives","authors":["Morris K.
