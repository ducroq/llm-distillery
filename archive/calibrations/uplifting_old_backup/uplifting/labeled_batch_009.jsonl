Well, here's exactly the kind of work we hoped would happen. rBridge: Use 1B models to predict whether your 32B model will be good at reasoning. Actually works. The problem: Small models can't do reasoning (emergence happens at 7B+), so how do you know if your training recipe works without spending $200k? Our solution: Align evaluation with both pre-training objective AND target task Use frontier model reasoning traces as gold labels Weight tokens by task importance automatically Results: 100x compute reduction vs baselines Accurately predict which datasets are worth training on R¬≤ = 0.826 predicting 32B performance from 1B proxy Works zero-shot on new datasets Tested on: GSM8K, MATH500, ARC-C, MMLU Pro, CQA, HumanEval Paper: https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013 This is what open research looks like - building on each other's work to make LLM development accessible to everyone, not just companies with infinite compute.
