To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12458","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.430998","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","eesssy","cssy","cset","csro","csar","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

We demonstrate through a four-stage argument that meaning within a formal system must arise from a process that is external, dynamic, and non-algorithmic. First, we prove that any purely symbolic system, devoid of external connections, cannot internally establish a consistent foundation for meaning due to self-referential paradoxes. Second, we extend this limitation to systems with any finite, static set of pre-established meanings, proving they are inherently incomplete. Third, we demonstrate that the very \"act\" of connecting an internal symbol to an external meaning cannot be a product of logical inference within the system but must be an axiomatic, meta-level update. Finally, we prove that any attempt to automate this update process using a fixed, external \"judgment\" algorithm will inevitably construct a larger, yet equally incomplete, symbolic system. Together, these conclusions formally establish that the grounding of meaning is a necessarily open-ended, non-algorithmic process, revealing a fundamental, G\\\"odel-style limitation for any self-contained intelligent system.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20409","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.439681","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cslo","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

We examine the benefit of having a protected eavesdropper-free zone around the legitimate receiver, and we determine the worst-case secrecy performance against a potential eavesdropper located anywhere outside the protected zone. A max-min optimization problem is formulated for the beamfocusing design with and without artificial noise transmission. Despite the NP-hardness of the problem, we develop a synchronous gradient descent-ascent framework that approximates the global maximin solution. A low-complexity solution is also derived that delivers excellent performance over a wide range of operating conditions. We further extend this study to a scenario where it is not possible to physically enforce a protected zone. To this end, we consider secure communications through the creation of a virtual protected zone using a full-duplex legitimate receiver. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting either the physical or virtual receiver-centered protected zone with appropriately designed beamfocusing is an effective strategy for achieving secure near-field communications.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19523","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.502238","language":"en","tags":["mathit","research","preprints","computer-science","csit","eesssp","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":162,"author":"Cen Liu, Xiangyun Zhou, Nan Yang, Salman Durrani, A.

In particular, we consider a classical damped wave equation, i.e., with constant coefficients, and a wave equation with a time-dependent coefficient for the damping term. For this time-dependent coefficient we analyze two cases: the scale-invariant case and the scattering producing case. We prove blow-up results and derive upper bound estimates for the lifespan of local solutions. Our approach is based on an iteration argument for a couple of functionals related to the components of a local

The main obstruction is that \\(Wf\\) is covariant (not invariant) under time-frequency shifts, so the effects of constructive interference must be taken into account. We close this compactness gap via concentration compactness for Heisenberg-type dislocations, together with a new asymptotic formula that quantifies the limiting contribution to concentration over $\\Omega$ from asymptotically separated wave packets. When $p=\\infty$ we also identify the sharp constant $2^d$ and show that it is attained. We also discuss some related extensions: For $\\tau$-Wigner distributions with $\\tau \\in (0,1)$ we isolate a chain phenomenon that obstructs the same strategy beyond the Wigner case ($\\tau=1/2$), while for the Born--Jordan distribution in $d=1$ we obtain existence of concentration optimizers for all $1\\le p<\\infty$ (the $p=\\infty$ supremum equals $\\pi$ but is not attained).","source":"science_arxiv_math","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18683","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:56:32.694778","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","mathfa","mathca","mathematics","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"math updates on arXiv.org","source_category":"science","word_count":166,"author":"Federico Stra, Erling A.
