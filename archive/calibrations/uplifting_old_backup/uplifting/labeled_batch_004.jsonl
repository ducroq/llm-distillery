{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_9003db18468a","title":"RiskTagger: An LLM","content":"arXiv:2510.17848v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: While the rapid growth of Web3 has driven the development of decentralized finance, user anonymity and cross-chain asset flows make on-chain laundering behaviors more covert and complex. In this context, constructing high-quality anti-money laundering(AML) datasets has become essential for risk-control systems and on-chain forensic analysis, yet current practices still rely heavily on manual efforts with limited efficiency and coverage. In this paper, we introduce RiskTagger, a large-language-model-based agent for the automatic annotation of crypto laundering behaviors in Web3. RiskTagger is designed to replace or complement human annotators by addressing three key challenges: extracting clues from complex unstructured reports, reasoning over multichain transaction paths, and producing auditor-friendly explanations. RiskTagger implements an end-to-end multi-module agent, integrating a key-clue extractor, a multichain fetcher with a laundering-behavior reasoner, and a data explainer, forming a data annotation pipeline. Experiments on the real case Bybit Hack (with the highest stolen asset value) demonstrate that RiskTagger achieves 100% accuracy in clue extraction, 84.1% consistency with expert judgment, and 90% coverage in explanation generation. Overall, RiskTagger automates laundering behavior annotation while improving transparency and scalability in AML research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17848","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.073355","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","csse","cscr","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive testing capabilities across various

We first audit five widely used gender classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace, it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over 50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of 1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender classification research.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17873","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.082239","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscv","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_909b8bbc8c4f","title":"Assignment","content":"arXiv:2510.17888v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study a joint routing-assignment optimization problem in which a set of items must be paired one-to-one with a set of placeholders while simultaneously determining a Hamiltonian cycle that visits every node exactly once. Both the assignment and routing decisions are optimized jointly to minimize the total travel cost. In this work, we propose a method to solve this problem using an exact MIP formulation with Gurobi, including cutting-plane subtour elimination. With analysis of the computational complexity and through extensive experiments, we analyze the computational limitations of this approach as the problem size grows and reveal the challenges associated with the need for more efficient algorithms for larger instances. The dataset, formulations, and experimental results provided here can serve as benchmarks for future studies in this research area.

We present a constructive proof that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693 Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17916","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.095490","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","q-bionc","csai","cslg","csne","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

As with any new technology, trust has taken on an important role in this discussion. In this chapter, we examine the multifaceted concept of trust in foundation models, particularly within a geographic context. As reliance on these models increases and they become relied upon for critical decision-making, trust, while essential, has become a fractured concept. Here we categorize trust into three types: epistemic trust in the training data, operational trust in the model's functionality, and interpersonal trust in the model developers. Each type of trust brings with it unique implications for geographic applications. Topics such as cultural context, data heterogeneity, and spatial relationships are fundamental to the spatial sciences and play an important role in developing trust. The chapter continues with a discussion of the challenges posed by different forms of biases, the importance of transparency and explainability, and ethical responsibilities in model development. Finally, the novel perspective of geographic information scientists is emphasized with a call for further transparency, bias mitigation, and regionally-informed policies. Simply put, this chapter aims to provide a conceptual starting point for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand trust in (generative) GeoAI.","source":"science_arxiv_cs","source_type":"rss","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17942","published_date":"2025-10-22T04:00:00","collected_date":"2025-10-22T12:55:56.103379","language":"en","tags":["research","preprints","computer-science","cscy","csai","science"],"metadata":{"feed_title":"cs

{"id":"science_arxiv_cs_23791a66b8f1","title":"Intuitionistic $j$","content":"arXiv:2510.17944v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Pearl's do-calculus to an Intuitionistic setting called $j$-stable causal inference inside a topos of sheaves. Our framework is an elaboration of the recently proposed framework of Topos Causal Models (TCMs), where causal interventions are defined as subobjects. We generalize the original setting of TCM using the Lawvere-Tierney topology on a topos, defined by a modal operator $j$ on the subobject classifier $\\Omega$. We introduce $j$-do-calculus, where we replace global truth with local truth defined by Kripke-Joyal semantics, and formalize causal reasoning as structure-preserving morphisms that are stable along $j$-covers. $j$-do-calculus is a sound rule system whose premises and conclusions are formulas of the internal Intuitionistic logic of the causal topos. We define $j$-stability for conditional independences and interventional claims as local truth in the internal logic of the causal topos. We give three inference rules that mirror Pearl's insertion/deletion and action/observation exchange, and we prove soundness in the Kripke-Joyal semantics. A companion paper in preparation will describe how to estimate the required entities from data and instantiate $j$-do with standard discovery procedures (e.g., score-based and constraint-based methods), and will include experimental results on how to (i) form data-driven $j$-covers (via regime/section constructions), (ii) compute chartwise conditional independences after graph surgeries, and (iii) glue them to certify the premises of the $j$-do rules in
