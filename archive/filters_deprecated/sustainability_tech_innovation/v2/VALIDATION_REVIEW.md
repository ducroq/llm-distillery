## Key Findings

### 1. **Promising Tier (4.0-6.0) is EXCELLENT** ✅
- 5/5 articles are real climate tech deployments
- Solar parks, battery storage, commercial products
- This tier is working perfectly

### 2. **Validated Tier (6.0-8.0) has ISSUES** ⚠️
- 2/5 clearly correct (EU imports, Tesla sales)
- 2/5 questionable (EV lease deals, GM pricing announcement)
- 1/5 incorrect (Tesla robot army - not climate tech deployment)
- **Issue:** Consumer/commercial news getting high scores

### 3. **Early Stage Tier (2.0-4.0) is MOSTLY GOOD** ✅
- 4/5 correctly scored
- 1/5 questionable (seismic research - unclear climate connection)
- Proposals correctly scored at 2.0

### 4. **Vaporware Tier (<2.0) is MOSTLY CORRECT** ✅
- 3/5 correctly scored
- 1/5 out of scope (bioinformatics - prefilter miss)
- 1/5 borderline (grid tariff reform - could argue either way)

---

## Concerns

### Major Issues:
1. **Consumer/commercial articles scoring too high**
   - EV lease deals (6.50) - Not about tech innovation
   - Tesla robot army (6.38) - Speculative AI article
   - These should be filtered or scored lower

2. **Prefilter leaks**
   - Bioinformatics article passed prefilter
   - Not climate/energy related

### Minor Issues:
1. **Borderline policy articles**
   - Grid tariff reforms could enable deployment but aren't tech themselves
   - Need clearer guidance on policy vs tech

---

## Recommendations

### Option A: **Proceed with training as-is** (CONSERVATIVE)
**Pros:**
- Promising tier (7.3%) is high quality
- Low tiers teach model to reject non-tech articles
- 462 useful articles is reasonable for distillation

**Cons:**
- Some validated tier articles are questionable
- Only 9.2% useful rate (lower than expected)

### Option B: **Filter to ≥4.0 and score more data** (QUALITY-FOCUSED)
**Pros:**
- Higher quality training data (promising+ only)
- Removes questionable low scorers

**Cons:**
- Only 462 articles (too small for good training)
- Would need to score another 5-10K articles to get 3K+ useful

### Option C: **Train on full dataset with weighted sampling** (BALANCED)
**Pros:**
- Use all 4,991 articles but oversample promising/validated
- Model learns full spectrum
- Larger dataset for better generalization

**Cons:**
- More complex training setup
- May confuse model if low scorers are inconsistent

---

## My Recommendation: **Option A - Proceed with training**

**Rationale:**
1. **Promising tier is excellent** - 5/5 samples correct
2. **Training needs negative examples** - Low scorers teach rejection
3. **462 useful articles is acceptable** - Similar to uplifting v4 (4,723 total)
4. **Can improve later** - If student model performs poorly, we can refine

**Next Steps:**
1. Create train/val/test splits (80/10/10)
2. Train Qwen2.5-7B student model
3. Validate student model performance
4. If student model has same issues (overscoring consumer articles), refine oracle prompt

---

## Decision Required

**Should we proceed with training on the full 4,991 article dataset?**

- [ ] YES - Proceed with training
- [ ] NO - Score more data first
- [ ] REFINE - Adjust oracle prompt and re-score
