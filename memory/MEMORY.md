## Topic Files

| File | When to load | Key insight |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `gemma3-model.md` | Model loading, PEFT, or Hub upload issues | Auto mapping fix, OLD vs NEW key format, torch float16 |
| `gpu-server.md` | Training on GPU or deploying to gpu-server | HF_HUB_OFFLINE, scp not rsync, venv path, PYTHONPATH |
| `filter-status.md` | Checking filter versions, MAE, or hybrid probe stats | Per-filter deployment status and in-dev blockers |
| `gotcha-log.md` | Stuck on infra, tooling, or something weird | Problem → Root cause → Fix archive |
| `thriving-v1-scoring.md` | Understanding thriving v1 attempts | PAUSED — bimodal distribution, MAE 0.94, findings and open questions |
| `uplifting-v7-training.md` | Understanding thriving v1 history | v7 prompt evolution → thriving v1 rename (ADR-012) |

## Universal Gotchas

- **Gemma-3 Auto mapping**: `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` doesn't support `gemma3_text`. Always use `load_base_model_for_seq_cls()`. See `gemma3-model.md`.
- **PEFT adapter format**: Keep OLD format for Hub. Never run `resave_adapter.py`. See `gemma3-model.md`.
- **PYTHONPATH**: Always set `PYTHONPATH=.` when running scripts that import `filters.*`.
- **scp not rsync**: rsync fails with dup() errors on gpu-server.
- **Windows safetensors**: Can't write to memory-mapped file. Save to temp, then `os.replace()`.
- **Training data dir naming**: Hyphens preserved: `cultural-discovery_v3`. Check actual dir names before scripting.
- **Config format variation**: `tiers:` (uplifting, cultural-discovery, investment-risk v6) vs `tier_thresholds:` (sustainability_tech v5).
- **Hyphenated filter imports**: Use `importlib.import_module()` — Python can't import hyphens.
- **Git Bash path mangling**: Set `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` before any command that passes Unix paths as arguments.

## Cross-Project: NexusMind

- NexusMind's `src/filters/filter_loader.py` auto-discovers from `filters/` directory
- NexusMind's output includes `nexus_mind_attributes` — downstream apps (ovr.news, dashboard, Aegis) depend on field names. Don't rename fields.
- gpu-server runs NexusMind scorer at `~/NexusMind/filters/`. Deploy new filters with `scp`, restart service.
- NexusMind pipeline runs every 4h on sadalsuud. Filter changes should be deployed to both gpu-server and sadalsuud.

## Deployment Targets

- **gpu-server**: `~/NexusMind/filters/` — uses `investment_risk` (underscore, not hyphen)
- **sadalsuud**: `~/local_dev/NexusMind/filters/` — Hub inference (no local model/ needed), venv at `~/local_dev/NexusMind/venv/`
- Deploy config changes to both servers after calibration or config updates

## Experiments

- **Quantization (#24)**: Naive PyTorch INT8 rejected — 2.6x faster but MAE +0.63. FP16 produces NaN on CPU. Next: ONNX Runtime or smaller base models. See `docs/experiments/quantization-benchmark-2026-03-07.md`.
- Benchmark script: `scripts/experiments/quantization_benchmark.py` (reusable for any filter)

- if [landing a non-trivial migration or refactor], then [fire code-reviewer + refactoring-guide + security-auditor in parallel before considering it shipped — they have non-overlapping blind spots] — promoted from gotcha-log 2026-04-29
- if [a regex correctness bug is found], then [audit siblings in the same file/author-style — same-shape bugs cluster] — promoted from gotcha-log 2026-04-29 (recurrence of #45 RIP issue → today's multilingual sweep)

## Active Decisions

<!-- One-liners about recent architectural choices, pointing to ADRs.
     If a decision lives here for more than one session without a formal ADR, create one. -->

- English-only lens/tab names — ADR-013 (2026-03-28)
- Lens-aligned filter naming at version bumps — ADR-012
- Cross-filter percentile normalization, supersedes score_scale_factor — ADR-014 (2026-03-30)
- Thriving v1 paused, bimodal distribution problem — uplifting v6 stays (2026-03-30)
- Declarative prefilter shape via BasePreFilter extension — ADR-018 (2026-04-28). Per-filter migration COMPLETE 2026-04-29 (#52, all 7 production filters); review-battery follow-ups also landed (RIP guard repair, POSITIVE_PATTERNS shadow rename, CD v4 truncation, uplifting v7 multilingual `\b` boundary sweep, investment-risk cleanups, CD v4 colonial tightening, `_check_domain_exclusions` hoist, `_pre_exclusion_check` hook). Class-name drift cleanup (sustech V2→V3, NR V1→V2) and per-category exception extension to `_is_excluded` (potential ADR-019) deferred — see `docs/TODO.md` "Post-#52 Review-Battery Followups".

## Next Up (from ROADMAP "Now")

- **foresight v1** — PARKED (#43, 2026-04-16). Captures governance solutions, not foresight; merging into broadened Solutions lens at sustainability_technology v4. <!-- verify: grep -qE "\*\*foresight\*\*.*PARKED" CLAUDE.md && echo PASS || echo FAIL -->
- **nature_recovery v2** — DEPLOYED to Hub 2026-04-19 after #44 fix (v2 package referenced v1 imports + repo_id before). <!-- verify: PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/deployment/verify_filter_package.py --filter filters/nature_recovery/v2 --check-hub > /dev/null && echo PASS || echo FAIL -->
- **nature_recovery v1 normalization** — FIXED (#32 closed 2026-04-09). Refit covers full score range (354 articles, x: 0.10–10.0). gpu-server scorer verified producing differentiated scores.
- **nature_recovery v2 normalization** — FITTED 2026-04-29 on 1,397 v2 production articles (filter_version=2.0, weighted_average≥1.5; raw range 1.50–7.08, p95=4.49). Patched `fit_normalization.py` with `--filter-version` to exclude v1 leftovers (#52 follow-up). Deployed to sadalsuud + gpu-server. <!-- verify: test -f filters/nature_recovery/v2/normalization.json && echo PASS || echo FAIL -->
- **prefilter shape harmonization** (#52) — COMPLETE 2026-04-29. All 7 production filters migrated to declarative shape; review-battery follow-ups also landed (8 commits). Remaining work: class-name drift cleanup batch (sustech V2→V3, NR V1→V2 — gated on NexusMind cross-repo coordination) and potential `_is_excluded` extension for per-category exceptions (deferred to ADR-019 design). See `docs/TODO.md` "Post-#52 Review-Battery Followups" for the full punch-list status. <!-- verify: grep -q "ADR-018" filters/common/base_prefilter.py && grep -q "DOMAIN_EXCLUSIONS" filters/common/base_prefilter.py && echo PASS || echo FAIL -->
- **raw_weighted_average** — Now passed through gpu-server API → sadalsuud pipeline → filtered output (#36 closed 2026-04-09). Normalization fitting script prefers it to avoid double-normalization.
- **thriving v1** — PAUSED. Candidate for two-stage scoring fix. See `memory/thriving-v1-scoring.md`.
- **#24** — ONNX Runtime INT8 or smaller base model retraining
