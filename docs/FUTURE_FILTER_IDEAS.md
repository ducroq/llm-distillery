# Future Filter Ideas

A parking lot for filter concepts worth exploring later.

## Equanimity

**Status:** Parked (2025-01-12)
**Origin:** Brainstorming during `belonging` filter development

### Concept

A filter rooted in Stoic and Buddhist traditions, focusing on **inner freedom** and **peace regardless of circumstances** — the complement to `belonging`.

| Filter | Core Value | Orientation |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `belonging` | Connection, rootedness, attachment | Outward — to place, people, tradition |
| `equanimity` | Inner freedom, non-attachment, acceptance | Inward — peace regardless of circumstances |

### What Would Score High

- Finding peace amid hardship or loss
- Acceptance of impermanence, aging, death
- Wisdom gained through suffering
- Contentment with simplicity (not minimalism as aesthetic)
- Letting go of status, ambition, accumulation
- Presence and attention in ordinary moments

### Industry-Captured (Filter Out)

- Mindfulness apps / productivity meditation
- "Stoicism for CEOs" / hustle culture stoicism
- Buddhism as corporate stress management
- Minimalism as lifestyle brand
- Self-optimization disguised as spirituality

### Philosophical Grounding

**Stoicism:**
- Dichotomy of control
- Inner citadel / self-sufficiency
- Amor fati (love of fate)
- Memento mori
- Virtue as the only good

**Buddhism:**
- Non-attachment
- Impermanence (anicca)
- Suffering from craving (dukkha/tanha)
- Middle way
- Mindfulness/presence

### Tensions to Navigate

Both traditions have elements that could be commercially hijacked:
- Stoicism → hustle culture, "no excuses" toxic positivity
- Buddhism → wellness industry, McMindfulness

The filter would need to distinguish authentic practice from commodified versions.

### Possible Dimensions

- `acceptance` — Embracing what cannot be changed
- `non_attachment` — Freedom from craving outcomes
- `presence` — Attention to the present moment (not productivity tool)
- `simplicity` — Contentment with less (not aesthetic minimalism)
- `wisdom_through_adversity` — Growth from difficulty (not toxic positivity)
- `mortality_awareness` — Honest relationship with death and impermanence

### Notes

This filter captures a genuinely different good than `belonging`. Where belonging emphasizes deep ties and rootedness, equanimity emphasizes inner freedom that doesn't depend on external circumstances. Both are valid paths to flourishing; both get commercially hijacked in different ways.
