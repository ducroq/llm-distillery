# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting significant technical and architectural decisions made in the llm-distillery project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures an important architectural decision, the context that led to it, the decision itself, and its consequences. ADRs help future developers (including yourself) understand why things are the way they are.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Choosing between architectural approaches
- Selecting libraries, frameworks, or tools
- Making trade-offs with long-term impact
- Establishing patterns or conventions
- Changing or superseding previous decisions

See `docs/agents/agent-operations.md` for detailed criteria and the creation protocol.

## ADR Template

Use `docs/agents/templates/ADR-TEMPLATE.md` as the starting point for new ADRs.

## Active ADRs

### 2025-11-14: Inline Filters for Fast Models
**File:** `2025-11-14-inline-filters-for-fast-models.md`

Restructure prompts to integrate critical filters inline with each dimension definition, rather than relying on top-level OUT OF SCOPE sections. Fast models (Gemini Flash, Claude Haiku) often skip top-level rules and jump directly to dimensional scoring.

**Impact:** Prompt calibration workflow updated with issue #5 (prompt structure). Inline filters reduced false positives from 87.5% to 0% for uplifting filter.

### 2025-11-14: Calibration/Validation Split
**File:** `2025-11-14-calibration-validation-split.md`

Apply train/test split pattern to prompt engineering. Use calibration sample to identify issues and fix prompt, then validate on fresh sample with different random seed to prevent overfitting.

**Impact:** Prompt calibration now includes mandatory validation step. Catches cases where prompt fixes work on calibration sample but don't generalize.

### 2025-11-13: Prompt Calibration Before Batch Labeling
**File:** `2025-11-13-prompt-calibration-before-batch-labeling.md` (v1.2)

Mandatory calibration step before batch labeling. Test oracle prompt on 50-100 article sample, identify systematic errors, fix prompt, validate, then proceed to batch labeling.

**Impact:** Prevents wasting $8-16 on mis-labeled datasets. Spent $0.047 on uplifting calibration to save $8+. Now at v1.2 with inline filters pattern.

### 2025-11-13: Remove Tier Classification from Oracle
**File:** `2025-11-13-remove-tier-classification-from-oracle.md`

Oracle outputs only dimensional scores (0-10 per dimension). Tier classification is computed post-processing from dimensional scores, not by the oracle.

**Impact:** Simplified oracle prompt, eliminated tier overfitting, post-filter controls tier thresholds.

### 2025-11-12: Dimensional Regression Training
**File:** `2025-11-12-dimensional-regression-training.md`

Train models on multi-dimensional regression (8 dimensional scores per article) rather than tier classification. Tier labels are metadata only.

**Impact:** Training, evaluation, QA workflows all focus on dimensional scores, not tier accuracy.

### 2025-11-12: Generic Training Data Preparation
**File:** `2025-11-12-generic-training-data-preparation.md`

Use a single generic script that reads filter configuration from config.yaml instead of separate scripts per filter.

**Impact:** Eliminates code duplication, enforces config.yaml as single source of truth, new filters require no code changes.

## Superseded ADRs

None yet.

## Deprecated ADRs

None yet.

## ADR Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD-title-in-kebab-case.md`

Examples:
- `2025-11-12-dimensional-regression-training.md`
- `2025-11-12-generic-training-data-preparation.md`

## ADR Status Values

- **Accepted:** This is the current decision
- **Superseded:** Replaced by a newer decision (link to replacement)
- **Deprecated:** No longer applicable (explain why)

## Finding Related ADRs

When creating a new ADR:
1. Check if existing ADRs are affected
2. Link related ADRs in "References" section
3. Update superseded ADRs to point to new decision

## Maintenance

- Archive old ADRs to `archive/` if they become irrelevant
- Keep active ADRs up-to-date if implementation changes
- Use "References" section to link related documentation
