## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices Summary

### Ground Truth Generation
âœ… Start small (test with 10-100 articles)
âœ… Use stratified sampling
âœ… Implement pre-filters (50% cost savings)
âœ… Monitor quality early and often
âœ… Document your prompt rationale

### Cost Management
âœ… Use Gemini Tier 1 for bulk labeling ($0.00018/article)
âœ… Use Claude for quality validation
âœ… Implement resume capability
âœ… Batch process to avoid rate limits

### Quality Assurance
âœ… Check tier distributions match expectations
âœ… Review edge cases manually
âœ… Validate against known examples
âœ… Monitor for drift over time
