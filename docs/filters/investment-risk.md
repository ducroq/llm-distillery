## üéì **Key Differentiators**

### 1. **Defense-First** (Not Offense)
Most tools tell you WHAT to buy. We tell you WHEN to get defensive.

### 2. **Capital Preservation** (Not Speculation)
Focus on not losing vs. chasing gains. Losing 50% requires 100% to recover.

### 3. **Macro-Focused** (Not Stock Picking)
Portfolio-level risk, not individual stock tips.

### 4. **Evidence-Based** (Not FOMO)
Hard data (Fed, ECB, credit spreads) not hot tips.

### 5. **No Conflicts** (Pure Subscription)
No affiliate commissions, no stock pumping, aligned incentives.

### 6. **Actionable for Hobby Investors**
Simple rebalancing (weeks/months), not day-trading (minutes).
