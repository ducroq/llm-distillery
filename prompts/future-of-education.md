# Future of Education: The AI Execution Paradox

## Mission
Identify articles that explore how AI/automation is fundamentally reshaping what knowledge and skills matter in education - specifically the paradox that traditional execution skills become less valuable while foundational understanding becomes MORE critical.

## The Core Paradox
- **Traditional execution skills** → Less valuable (AI/automation handles it)
- **Foundational understanding** → MORE valuable (to validate, critique, guide AI)
- **New critical skill**: Knowing when to trust AI vs human judgment

## Target Content

### HIGH RELEVANCE (Score 8-10)
Articles that directly address the paradox:
- How foundational knowledge becomes MORE important with AI
- Teaching validation/critique skills for AI outputs
- Shift from execution → sense-making in education
- What to assess when AI can execute everything
- Research on learning retention with AI assistance
- Professional training adapting to AI augmentation

**Example**: "Medical schools emphasize diagnostic reasoning over memorizing symptoms - students must validate AI diagnoses, not compete with them"

### MODERATE RELEVANCE (Score 5-7)
Articles about educational transformation with AI:
- AI literacy and prompt engineering education
- New pedagogical models for AI era
- Human-AI collaboration in learning
- Assessment transformation (beyond traditional exams)
- Discipline-specific adaptations (medicine, law, engineering)
- Research on cognitive effects of AI-assisted learning

**Example**: "Engineering programs add 'AI validation' courses - students learn when simulation results need experimental verification"

### LOW RELEVANCE (Score 1-4)
Articles about education/AI but missing the paradox:
- Generic EdTech product announcements
- AI replacing teachers (automation narrative only)
- Basic digital learning tools
- Administrative AI applications
- Student chatbot assistants
- LMS/gradebook software

**Example**: "New AI tutoring app launches with personalized practice problems"

### NOT RELEVANT (Score 0)
- No connection to education OR AI
- Pure tech news without educational angle
- Marketing content for EdTech products
- Political education debates (unless about curriculum for AI era)

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Paradox Engagement (0-10)
Does the article grapple with the execution vs understanding paradox?
- **10**: Directly explores what skills/knowledge matter when AI handles execution
- **7**: Discusses changing skill requirements in AI era
- **4**: Mentions need for "AI literacy" but superficially
- **0**: No engagement with changing educational fundamentals

### 2. Depth of Analysis (0-10)
How deeply does it analyze the transformation?
- **10**: Research-backed, multiple perspectives, nuanced trade-offs
- **7**: Thoughtful analysis with examples from specific disciplines
- **4**: Surface-level observations without depth
- **0**: Just announcing a product or event

### 3. Actionable Insights (0-10)
Does it provide concrete examples of adaptation?
- **10**: Specific curriculum changes, assessment models, or pedagogical innovations
- **7**: Clear examples from institutions/disciplines adapting
- **4**: Vague suggestions about "adapting to AI"
- **0**: No actionable content

### 4. Cross-Disciplinary Relevance (0-10)
Is this applicable beyond one narrow context?
- **10**: Insights apply across multiple fields (medicine, law, engineering, science)
- **7**: Focused on one discipline but principles transfer
- **4**: Very narrow technical implementation
- **0**: Single institution/product only

## Key Questions to Guide Analysis

1. Does this article address what skills/knowledge become MORE important with AI?
2. Does it explore the tension between execution vs understanding?
3. Are there concrete examples of educational transformation?
4. Is there research or evidence backing the claims?
5. Does it go beyond "teach coding/AI literacy" to deeper questions?
6. Would this help educators/institutions adapt meaningfully?

## Red Flags (Lower Score)

- Pure product marketing
- "AI will replace teachers" without nuance
- No engagement with curriculum/pedagogy changes
- Just describing existing AI tools in education
- No discussion of what students need to learn differently
- Vague "adapt to AI" without specifics

## Green Flags (Higher Score)

- Explores the execution-understanding paradox explicitly
- Concrete curriculum or assessment innovations
- Research on learning outcomes with AI
- Multi-disciplinary applicability
- Addresses validation/critique skills
- Discusses what makes human judgment valuable
- Examples of professional training evolution
