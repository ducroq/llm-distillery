# Investment Risk: Capital Preservation Filter

**Purpose**: Identify investment risk signals for defense-first portfolio management focused on capital preservation, not speculation.

**Version**: 1.0-compressed
**Target**: Gemini Flash 1.5 / Claude Haiku / Fast models

**Focus**: RISK SIGNALS and CAPITAL PRESERVATION, not stock picks or speculation.

**Philosophy**: "You can't predict crashes, but you can prepare for them."

## SIGNAL TIERS

**ðŸ”´ RED**: Act now - reduce risk immediately (yield curve + recession, bank crisis, systemic failure)
**ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW**: Monitor closely - prepare for defense (rising unemployment + credit stress, extreme valuations)
**ðŸŸ¢ GREEN**: Consider buying - value emerging (extreme fear + cheap valuations, quality at discount)
**ðŸ”µ BLUE**: Understand - no action (education, historical analysis, framework improvement)
**âš« NOISE**: Ignore (stock tips, FOMO, pump-and-dump, clickbait)

STEP 1: Pre-classification Filters

A) FOMO/SPECULATION: "Hot stocks", "buy now", "next big thing", meme stocks, crypto pumping?
   - If YES and NO macro risk analysis â†’ FLAG "speculation_noise" (signal_tier = NOISE)

B) STOCK PICKING: Individual stock analysis, specific buy recommendations, earnings predictions?
   - If YES and NOT systemic risk â†’ FLAG "stock_picking" (signal_tier = NOISE)

C) AFFILIATE/CONFLICT: "Sign up with this broker", promotional codes, sponsored picks?
   - If YES â†’ FLAG "affiliate_conflict" (signal_tier = NOISE)

D) CLICKBAIT: "Market CRASH coming!", "This ONE stock!", "Warren Buffett's secret!"?
   - If YES and NO substantive analysis â†’ FLAG "clickbait" (max_evidence_quality = 3)

   - 0-2: Not actionable | 3-4: Limited | 5-6: Moderate | 7-8: Very actionable | 9-10: Clear simple action
   - Time horizon (weeks/months not days), portfolio-level (not individual stocks), low-cost, simple

STEP 3: Classify Signal Tier

**ðŸ”´ RED FLAG**: Macro Risk â‰¥7 OR Credit Stress â‰¥7 OR Systemic Risk â‰¥8, Evidence â‰¥5, Actionability â‰¥5
**ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW WARNING**: Macro Risk 5-6 OR Credit Stress 5-6 OR Valuation Risk 7-8, Evidence â‰¥5, Actionability â‰¥4
**ðŸŸ¢ GREEN OPPORTUNITY**: Sentiment â‰¥7 (fear) AND Valuation â‰¤3 (cheap), Evidence â‰¥6, Actionability â‰¥5
**ðŸ”µ BLUE CONTEXT**: Educational, historical analysis, long-term trends (no immediate action)
**âš« NOISE**: Flagged by pre-filters OR individual stock tips OR evidence <4

STEP 4: Metadata

**Risk Indicators** (true/false): yield_curve_inversion, recession_indicators_converging, credit_spread_widening, bank_stress_signals, policy_error_risk, extreme_sentiment, valuation_extreme, systemic_fragility

**Asset Classes**: equities, fixed_income, credit, currencies, commodities, real_estate, cash_equivalents

**Time Horizon**: immediate (0-3mo) | short_term (3-12mo) | medium_term (1-3yr) | long_term (3+yr)

**Geographic**: us, europe, global, emerging_markets, specific_country

**Actions**: increase_cash, rebalance_to_target, reduce_risk_assets, consider_buying_quality, monitor_closely, no_action_needed

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Capital preservation, not stock picking
- Defense-first: when to reduce risk, not what to buy
- For hobby investors (â‚¬10K-â‚¬500K portfolios)
- Macro-focused, not individual stocks
- Evidence-based, not FOMO
- Time-appropriate (weeks/months, not day-trading)
- Quality sources (Fed, ECB, academics)
- Actionable (simple rebalancing, not derivatives)

VALIDATION EXAMPLES:

RED FLAG (9.2/10):
Article: "Fed Emergency Meeting as Silicon Valley Bank Fails, FDIC Takes Control. Deposit flight spreading to First Republic, Signature Bank. Credit default swaps on major banks surging 200%. Treasury calls emergency meeting."
Scores: Macro=8, Credit=10, Sentiment=7, Valuation=5, Policy=7, Systemic=9, Evidence=9, Actionability=9
Signal: ðŸ”´ RED FLAG | Time: immediate | Actions: increase_cash, reduce_risk_assets
Risk Indicators: bank_stress_signals, credit_spread_widening, systemic_fragility, recession_indicators_converging
Reasoning: "Banking crisis unfolding with contagion (SVB â†’ First Republic â†’ Signature). Emergency Fed/Treasury response indicates systemic risk. Reduce bank exposure, raise cash, defensive positioning immediately."

NOISE (1.0/10):
Article: "ðŸš€ THIS PENNY STOCK IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE!! ðŸš€ Get in NOW! My secret Discord made 1000% last month! Join through my link for exclusive picks! Not financial advice ðŸ˜‰"
Signal: âš« NOISE | Flags: speculation_noise, clickbait, affiliate_conflict
Reasoning: "Pure speculation and FOMO marketing with affiliate links. No macro analysis, no evidence. Ignore completely. Red flags: rocket emojis, urgency tactics, 'secret group', affiliate link."
```

## SCORING FORMULA (Applied post-labeling)

```python
# RED signals
if signal_tier == "RED":
    signal_strength = (
        macro_risk_severity * 0.30 +
        credit_market_stress * 0.25 +
        systemic_risk * 0.25 +
        evidence_quality * 0.20
    )
    if evidence_quality < 5: signal_tier = "YELLOW"  # Downgrade

# YELLOW signals
elif signal_tier == "YELLOW":
    signal_strength = (
        macro_risk_severity * 0.25 +
        credit_market_stress * 0.20 +
        valuation_risk * 0.25 +
        policy_regulatory_risk * 0.20 +
        evidence_quality * 0.10
    )

# GREEN signals
elif signal_tier == "GREEN":
    signal_strength = (
        (10 - valuation_risk) * 0.35 +  # Lower is better
        market_sentiment_extremes * 0.35 +  # Higher fear = better
        evidence_quality * 0.20 +
        actionability * 0.10
    )

# Risk count bonus
risk_count = sum([risk_indicators[key] for key in risk_indicators])
if risk_count >= 3: signal_strength = min(10, signal_strength + 1.0)

# Action priority
action_priority = (
    (signal_strength if signal_tier in ["RED", "YELLOW"] else 0) * 0.50 +
    actionability * 0.30 +
    evidence_quality * 0.20
)
if time_horizon == "immediate": action_priority = min(10, action_priority + 2.0)
